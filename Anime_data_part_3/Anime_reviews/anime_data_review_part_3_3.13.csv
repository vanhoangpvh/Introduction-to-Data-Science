Ihatov Gensou: Kenji no Haru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1206/Ihatov_Gensou__Kenji_no_Haru,"['How do you make a fitting tribute to a great person? Well, this is how. It\'s *exactly* how it needed to be in this case: poetic and extremely heartfelt.Spring and Chaos is a short parable on Kenji Miyazawa\'s life as an adult, directed by Shoji Kawamori of Macross and Escaflowne fame. Of course, one cannot expect a comprehensive life account in less than an hour\'s time—thankfully, the movie doesn\'t attempt that. Colorful and deliberately surreal, it instead relays the atmosphere of Miyazawa\'s works and the circumstances of their creation, the physical and emotional turmoil he was going through in his short life, and his unique...and vivid vision of the world around him, doing so in short and poignant glimpses that tell us exactly as much as we need to know to understand his personality. Surrounded by misfortune, sadness, and misunderstanding, Miyazawa\'s soul shone through in his unrelenting dedication to comprehending the world and enriching the lives of others back when almost nobody—including most of his family members—could realize the extent of his talent, strength of character, and self-sacrifice.The movie quite fittingly gives us a good taste of Miyazawa\'s writing and worldview by presenting his life as a visual poem where characters are portrayed as cats—and does so by capturing the very essence of poetry in all of its splendor without focusing too much on the worldly details; in a sense, taking an approach almost exactly inverse of the over-represented slice-of-life genre. Call it an ""essence of life"": the genre where you say little to tell a lot. And yes, in its relatively short runtime it tells quite enough to emotionally overwhelm—just like good poetry should.Many of you know how it feels to rewatch something you first saw many years ago. More often than not you fail to recapture that first-time experience. But Spring and Chaos is one of those very rare pieces of art that doesn\'t only stand the test of time—it actually becomes better on a subsequent watch. I was just under 20 when I first saw it, and while it certainly did seem inspired and engaging at the time, I couldn\'t say I was moved very much. But now I\'m 30, and it completely wrecks me. Perhaps, it\'s just that it\'s easier to empathize as you grow older, or maybe it\'s because I\'ve grown to appreciate poetry more since my teenage years. I don\'t know, but it\'s hard to even write this simple review without choking up. So many scenes in Spring and Chaos are unbelievably powerful despite the narrative subtlety. This is especially prominent in the second half, considering the movie has very little actual dialogue and relies predominantly on visual storytelling. All in all a mark of an outstanding work that transcends its medium and succeeds at its ultimate task: to introduce the viewer to the marvelous world of Kenji Miyazawa. The lamp is lost, its light forever preserved. Sleep well, Kenji-san. and vivid vision of the world around him, doing so in short and poignant glimpses that tell us exactly as much as we need to know to understand his personality.

It's not very long, barely and hour but for such a short movie that would seem to be a child's animation, I was very impressed. I of course watched the dubbed version - it wouldn't have mattered to me - and though the voice acting was a bit shaky, it didn't take away from the actual story. I was very impressed by it's mix of CGI renders and animation, the effects taken on during one scenes left me speechless.This movie really isn't...for everyone, the whole idea of the story is somewhat vague if you try to really understand it. But, in no less does that take away from the whole experience. I truly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Miyazaki film or a Otomo film.I do say though with heart, the main character, Kenji, left me to wonder a lot of things about life and its surroundings. This movie can teach you something. for everyone, the whole idea of the story is somewhat vague if you try to really understand it. But, in no less does that take away from the whole experience.

Irregular Hunter X: The Day of Sigma,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2808/Irregular_Hunter_X__The_Day_of_Sigma,"['Megaman X was first released in 1993. The series was the first of many spin-offs of Capcom\'s Megaman franchise and has been highly successful, receiving eight sequels (one being the Command Mission RPG), and a prequel OVA. That\'s right, back in 2005 Capcom and Xebec combined efforts and came up with an OVA prequel for the Megaman X franchise. Let\'s take a look at Maverick Hunter X: The Day of Sigma.The story is pretty simple. It\'s about how Sigma went from being a maverick hunter, to the head maverick. For those of you who aren\'t familiar with the games, reploids are robots with the power...of self determination. Occasionally some of them go ""maverick"" and try to harm others or just go berserk. If you\'re a fan of the X franchise it\'s an interesting look at the way things were before Sigma\'s treachery, even if you already know how things are going to end.The Day of Sigma does do a decent job of fleshing out some of the characters a bit more than what you see of them in the games, especially Sigma and Vile. It avoids throwing in a bunch of characters from the games in order to keep things fairly clean and focused. Which does work to its benefit.The art is deliberately reminiscent of the games. The characters look good and the battle scenes, though short, are nice and intense. Unfortunately, the backgrounds are kind of dull.The voice acting is pretty well done. Sakurai Takahiro, Okiayu Ryotaro and Mugihito especially give strong performances. X is Cloud Strife, I just had to point that out. The music is pretty weak and forgettable. It could have benefited from doing more with the background music.The yuri factor is a 1/10. There\'s only one female character and she has a small role.My final rating for Maverick Hunter X: The Day of Sigma is an 8/10. If you\'re a fan of the Megaman X franchise you should definitely see it. If you aren\'t you should probably skip it since there\'s really nothing to appeal to non-fans. of self determination.

If you aren\'t you should probably skip it since there\'s really nothing to appeal to non-fans.', ""This one-off Mega Man X anime was included as unlockable content in the PlayStation Portable's Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, a remake of the first game in the series. I beat the game, which was the prerequisite to gaining the video, but for some reason I never watched it. It was a little unfortunate, as this bears the distinction of being the best Mega Man anime ever made. That's not saying much considering their generally average quality and the fact the games themselves were never strong on story, but if you've gained an attraction to the world and characters simply through constant exposure among the...huge franchise, then possibly nothing is better than scratching that curiosity for world expansion than this OVA. It's a prequel to the first game and details Sigma's turn from Maverick Hunter to Maverick, and X's evolution as a new Hunter. The writing is surprisingly okay, avoiding the contradictions of lore within its own storyline like many X plots do. The plot itself is as uncomplicated as you'd expect. X, Zero, and Sigma investigate the attacks of several unmanned robots, with some nice cameo appearances by Chill Penguin, Storm Eagle, and Vile while they're still allies. Music is complete background noise, but the animation is very solid with some subtle use of CG to give the machines some curvature depth and actual weight when combined with the mechanical sound design straight from the games. All in all, it's a solid OVA that brings a niche attribute of Mega Man (the story) to a level it hasn't really been at before, and while that's not a high water mark relative to general anime or video games, it means it carves a particular use and interest for Mega Man fans. huge franchise, then possibly nothing is better than scratching that curiosity for world expansion than this OVA.

The first Megaman X immediately before the first Maverick Outbreak. This game series was my personal favorite of all times and I played all 8 games to completion and I grew up off of this series.With that being said my only disappointment is the lack of a sequel and further coverage of the Megaman X timeline. There are dozens of un-answered about the crossover between the original Megaman and Megaman X. And even the Megaman Zero and Megaman.exe worlds.I had hoped that this would be the point of  starting to fill those holes in...and I feel like this did an ok job of explaining the world leading into the first Megaman X game and covered the state of the world very well.If you are a megaman fan and love the franchise then watch this movie. and I feel like this did an ok job of explaining the world leading into the first Megaman X game and covered the state of the world very well.If you are a megaman fan and love the franchise then watch this movie.', ""This small bonus unlockable 24 minute OVA from the PSP game Maverick Hunter X  was pretty good for what it was. This OVA takes place before the first MegaMan X game and shows how X and Zero's commander Sigma turned from being the lovable Commander of the Maverick Hunters to the cruel Maverick Emperor seen throughout the X series of games.The art is very accurate to the character design from the X games. X himself looks very adorable yet badass which is kinda the point as X is a really kind robot boy at heart. Sigma doesn't have his Iconic...cape until the last minutes of the OVA, but that is to show when he went from respected Commander to Evil Dictator. Chill Penguin looks really cool (pun intended) and very sharp and Storm Eagle looks kinda weird. The generic soldiers look generic. Zero's design is a bit of a mix between his classic appearance from the X series and his more round redesign from the Megaman Zero series. The CG is noticeable, but it looks better on PSP. And it actually provides a good contrast for some moral scenes for X.The voice acting in the Sub and Dub are both very good. The actors seem to really understand their characters and Sigma's voice slightly changes during the reveal when he becomes evil. Penguin has a very cute and high pitched voice in the sub which is exactly what i imagined him sounding like. The music surprisingly was mediocre. I wish they used tracks from the game like maybe the Zero theme, Sigma's theme, and when Dr Light appeared maybe even the MEGAMAN 2 opening theme could have played. Hey at least the acting isn't bad like in Megaman 8 or X4. BASS WHY MUST I FIGHT YOU. DOCTA WAHWEE. WHADDYOUTHINKYADOING. PREPAREURSELF. NO THIS ISNT HAPPENING WHAT AM I  FIGHTING FOOOOOOOR. Sorry I had toThe characters are just the characters really. X is shown exactly like in the games. He prefers to not hurt others, but will fightto protect others. Zero is the smart and friendly badass he was in the games, and a big friendly companion to X. Chill Penguin and Storm Eagle don't really do much but they are apparently high up captains in the Maverick Hunters before they become Maverick themselves. Sigma is shown as the respected commander that was mentioned in the previous games, but this OVA let us see it. We also see how he planned his domination and his cunning attitude unleash. Vile is shown as becoming Maverick which as we know does happen as he is the first boss in thd X series with the iconic scene of Zero coming in and saving X before Vile could kill him. I am however disappointed that we only saw 2 of the 8 Robot Master Mavericks from the game. It would have been cool to see Spark Mandrill,Sting Chameleon, Launch Octopus, Armored Armadillo, Flame Mammoth, and Boomerang Kuwanger in action before they  became evil.The story shows how Sigma became evil. Thats about it. There is a conspiracy and everything. There are continuity errors though. X was sealed for a different reason, Cain found X earlier than the original game, and Cain dies.I would check it outif you are curious cape until the last minutes of the OVA, but that is to show when he went from respected Commander to Evil Dictator.

Obviously, as this is an anime, there are over exaggerations present, such as training times and rapid advancement in skill (this issue is present in every single sports anime you view,...but for viewing purposes you can't complain.) I do however find that they actually take these advancements in skill very well explained, so I can't complain as they are potentially feasible, such as mastering a core gymnastics skill in one week (I say feasible as the characters in question dedicated enough time towards this goal.) Actual story wise, I do like the routes they took, the way the story progresses is sometimes unexpected, but it is welcome and still great and comical.~~ Art ~~The art style is certainly different from what you'd see today! At first I was taken back by this quite a lot as I had not watched anything with this art style before. The anime was produced in 1996, so the art style prevalent then was not as refined and perfectly animated as it is today (as of 2018 haha!) The anime does look old and you can certainly tell that it was before the boom of the technology era, from an age of dial up internet, computers the size of a bed-side table, and when telephones were attached to the wall. If you don't understand this and expect a CGI like anime with unbelievable graphics, you're going to be in for a shock. This anime's style I find is actually classical I feel; it has the feel that is homely and comforting. Think early Ghibli animation. This anime has made me appreciate this art style and I have to admit, I adore it and I couldn't ever imagine this anime in a more modern style. Oh, and I know in a lot of animes you tend to get same face syndrome, but this anime has seemed to always show different kinds of people, face shapes, colours, and so forth. The characters can easily be recognised from each other (even characters who aren't important to the story or who are only present for a single episode.)~~ Sound ~~Alright so the way I watched this anime had some issues, the host I watched it with sadly didn't have a great quality and the audio and visuals were delayed. That is to say, there are no issues with the sound itself, there isn't anything missing from the audio, all of the voice recordings are beautiful or hilarious, but the quality is high (for the era.) You don't hear anything that you shouldn't, such as things sometimes heard in other animes, such as voice echoing, or voices projecting in a recording studio or a grainy sound. Do the voices sound natural? Not all - but I feel those voices are meant to stand out and relate extremely well to their character's persona; without these unique character's voice's you wouldn't have some of the great comedy in this anime. Nonetheless, a problem I have found was an issue to properly replicate the sounds of gymnastics, don't get me wrong, it - does - sound very similar and correct, but, sometimes it feels a little synthetic (such as the swoosh noise.) I should commend them on actually also adding the creaking and noises of the equipment when used too; it added to the immersion and helped me immerse myself well (Nothing's worse when you get a sports anime that doesn't add this sorta thing... I wonder which anime I'm on about there...) A problem I did find however was translations were not always accurate (again this may be an issue with my host and not the anime.) I am sure that their terminology in Japanese is spot on, but the translation doesn't always come through properly - such as the apparatus names or skill names (such as a round off, flick, somersault, iron cross, etc etc etc) but these are again specialist terms that aren't going to be known to a common translator.~~ Characters ~~The main character is a great optimist and has an amazing work ethic. He just fills the anime with confidence and encouragement, it really does make you feel good. There are also other characters who balance this out with pessimism, or some deviant behaviour, but regardless, it is usually always leaving you feeling good; exactly what you want in a comedy anime. You want a good time, to laugh and feel good, this anime does just that. The interactions between characters have some great comedic consequences and it feels like natural behaviour for when those types of people get together. As mentioned above, there are characters who from the start seem hilarious simply due to how they sound and look, but actually get fleshed out and have character development in the series. Denji Higashi is the character that makes me laugh the most, from his skills, his dialogue, and how he interacts with people like Minoru Uchida. Even Denji has great character later on and becomes someone you can really rely on and be in awe of. The main character, Fujimaki Shun, also has a lot of character development and doesn't fail to keep you interested as his story goes. Even characters like Sanada Toshihiko are great too. This development can certainly be seen in around episode 20-30 for certainty and is really highlighted in 25-30. I can't fault them for their characters; the characters do exactly what they want us to do. Some twists involving characters can also make us begin to support and appreciate previous antagonists!~~ Enjoyment ~~This anime is clearly a comedy, it has great comedic devices, but can also get serious too at moments, which is a nice relief as constant comedy can be draining. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and it kept me constantly wanting to watch the next episode after finishing the previous one. The enjoyment comes from a variety of places, such as the characters and how the plot unfolds, to their success; I found myself quite literally cheering and celebrating with them when things went well and gasped when it didn't. They really grasp you in well and it really makes you feel like you're watching actual competitions (providing you can immerse yourself in the first place, I was able to at around episode 10-12 and loved it since then.)~~ Overall ~~So my question to myself here was simple: did it beat my expectations? Did it make me feel happier than I did before I watched it? Did it make me love the characters and feel involved with it? The answer to all of those questions is simply yes! As a gymnast and coach myself I could relate well to some of the scenarios in training and competition, especially the nerves! I loved some of the arcs and how the incorporated humour into a traditionally serious sport where a single finger, toe, or hand out of place can land the gymnast a serious deduction. I really feel like they should have more animes about gymnastics, if there was a second season of this, I'd watch it in a heart beat (but it's been over 20 years now... I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon sadly!) I should also add that watching this anime really excites me for gymnastics and I have to simply pause the video or after the end of the episode to go and do some gymnastics!! Even in my bedroom haha! (thank god I am best at floor apparatus!) It really helps to ignite a passion and love for the sport. I can't recommend this anime enough, but I will be telling my friends in advance that you might have to get past the art style and sound a little, but once you get into the anime, you'll love these qualities you were unsure of at first. And yes, I will literally be recommending this anime to absolutely everyone I meet that have a vague interest in sports anime or gymnastics.... Maybe I should make it mandatory viewing for my University Gymnastics Club! Haha! but for viewing purposes you can't complain.) I do however find that they actually take these advancements in skill very well explained, so I can't complain as they are potentially feasible, such as mastering a core gymnastics skill in one week (I say feasible as the characters in question dedicated enough time towards this goal.)

Some twists involving characters can also make us begin to support and appreciate previous antagonists!~~ Enjoyment ~~This anime is clearly a comedy, it has great comedic devices, but can also get serious too at moments, which is a nice relief as constant comedy can be draining. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and it kept me constantly wanting to watch the next episode after finishing the previous one. The enjoyment comes from a variety of places, such as the characters and how the plot unfolds, to their success; I found myself quite literally cheering and celebrating with them when things went well and gasped when it didn't. They really grasp you in well and it really makes you feel like you're watching actual competitions (providing you can immerse yourself in the first place, I was able to at around episode 10-12 and loved it since then.)~~ Overall ~~So my question to myself here was simple: did it beat my expectations? Did it make me feel happier than I did before I watched it? Did it make me love the characters and feel involved with it? The answer to all of those questions is simply yes! As a gymnast and coach myself I could relate well to some of the scenarios in training and competition, especially the nerves! I loved some of the arcs and how the incorporated humour into a traditionally serious sport where a single finger, toe, or hand out of place can land the gymnast a serious deduction. I really feel like they should have more animes about gymnastics, if there was a second season of this, I'd watch it in a heart beat (but it's been over 20 years now... I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon sadly!) I should also add that watching this anime really excites me for gymnastics and I have to simply pause the video or after the end of the episode to go and do some gymnastics!! Even in my bedroom haha! (thank god I am best at floor apparatus!) It really helps to ignite a passion and love for the sport. I can't recommend this anime enough, but I will be telling my friends in advance that you might have to get past the art style and sound a little, but once you get into the anime, you'll love these qualities you were unsure of at first. And yes, I will literally be recommending this anime to absolutely everyone I meet that have a vague interest in sports anime or gymnastics.... Maybe I should make it mandatory viewing for my University Gymnastics Club! Haha!"", ""Overall: Comedic and able to enjoy despite many flaws. I have to say just being talented alone doesn't mean a beginner will gain so much strength, balance, flexibility and skill instantly like Shun. It's actually completely BS in my opinion the rate at which he progresses in skills and technique that would actually injure anyone without extensive training history. You don't just decide you want to do planche and iron cross just cuz'. Also everyone including Shun buffs up way too fast and unrealistically because plot demands complete beginners even Ueno gain elite bodies, skills and strength instantly to make anime work in such short...time frame.Story:Pretty straight forward. Shun joins the gymnastics team as a beginner and works his way to the top. Add light romance into the mix and MC with plenty of determination. Heavily overdramaticized.Art:Ok at times but not nearly enough effort put in even for the 90's in my opinion. Possibly had a low budget. Some scenes you can tell they put more effort while others the faces and proportions are whacky.Music:Can be redundant as they continue overplaying the same tunes to death.Characters:While nobody is perfect, I am blown away by the team's overall mentality to give up and not even wholeheartedly try until literally their last performance. Some of the character's personality and actions just about drove me crazy.Summary: Enjoyable and still worth watching for comedy, however it is way too overdramatic and drags on too long. Anime is fluffed up and sparse at times with many flaws but comedy is its redeeming factor. time frame.Story:Pretty straight forward.

I give it a true 10/10 MASTERPIECE for such a cutesy comedy anime <3', 'As an autistic girl, Umika\'s social struggles and pervasive sense of alienation are EXTREMELY relatable. It\'s really common for autistic people to feel like we\'re aliens waiting to be taken back home or eternal observers, who never really are a part of any social group. Like our words and feelings can\'t reach other people, because we tend to communicate differently. Still, we do our best to never lose hope that someday. somewhere we\'ll find our tribe.I know she\'s just supposed to have a stutter, but I do get strong autistic vibes from Umika. Her being relatively immature for a high schooler and having a special...interest in space (similiar to mine!) only add into it.Another character that could fit the description is Raimon, who literally stopped coming to school after she gave up on socializing to focus on her special interest of building robots. This whole ""I don\'t do things I\'m not interested in"" thing deeply resonates with me. She became avoidant after she got shunned for her unusual interests and what other people perceived as rude remarks - pretty usual autistic experience. Also, feeling like we are more logical than other people is a pretty common coping mechanism among autistics. I went through a similar phase myself, where I was sure ""normal"" people\'s perceptions of the world were way more surface level than mine, which is a toxic mindset that\'s fairly easy to fall into. interest in space (similiar to mine!) only add into it.Another character that could fit the description is Raimon, who literally stopped coming to school after she gave up on socializing to focus on her special interest of building robots.

This task of escaping to space however, would be no easy task, which is shown throughout the series as Umika, along with 3 other girls try to engage in aerospace engineering from a complete beginner standpoint.Plot:In terms of plot, it\'s already doing better than most Yuri anime/manga, so props! Most Yuri series tend to struggle with establishing a plot in general, so having a plot that guides the story while gradually shifting as the story progresses is a good thing. The plot...itself though, is not the greatest. The dream shared by Umika and Yu is so unrealistic that I found myself pausing and asking myself, ""are they serious..?"" The unrealistic goal they set of trying to go to space is a direct reflection of this series: naïve. This anime severely struggles to tackle realistic topics, I also found myself growing quite tired of that pretty early on. Playing around, doing this, that, all of that is cool, but when will these characters all face each other and realize just what they have to do in order to reach that goal of traveling to space, and how will that affect what they\'ve established so far? Will that goal crumble? Will they advance? These are the types of question this plot left me with.Characters:The characters in Hoshikuzu Telepath honestly aren\'t that special. This was a thought I had throughout the entirety of watching this Anime. The only one who left any sort of real impression on me was Yu Akeuchi: the self-proclaimed ""alien"" who ironically is the most interesting in the series. Characters aren\'t something that I\'m usually too knit picky about, because writing good and unique characters is difficult, however, in this anime it feels like the writers didn\'t really try to make any new original concepts for characters. None of the characters in this Anime hold a compelling ideology or even a personality that sets them apart from others. They\'re all just kind of... Bland. Characters like Matataki and Haruno are honestly the saving grace when it comes down to characters in this anime: at face value, they\'re nothing special, but when compared to other characters in this anime they\'re worlds apart. Okay, not every anime needs perfect characters, right?Art:The art says a lot about the anime: it\'s very eye catching and modern, perfect for the standards of todays anime. The art is the main factor that\'ll attract you, and likely others to this anime. When watching, all of the frames look extremely fluid, and overall, just very pretty. Not much to say when it comes to art. It EXCEEDS expectations, especially for a Yuri anime.Conclusion:While I wholeheartedly just believe that this anime wasn\'t exactly for me, I still found it quite enjoyable. I don\'t have much of anything negative to say about it, my points listed above could more or less be applied to any Yuri anime you could find, so i\'d have to recommend you to all watch it on your own time. I believe a lot of you will enjoy this more than I did. For a Yuri anime, it\'s great. I\'d love to see other anime/manga use Hoshikuzu Telepath as reference in the future and upgrade! itself though, is not the greatest.

As a result, she sees space as her true home and wants to befriend an alien. One day the joyful exchange student Yuu Akeuchi comes into her class and promptly claims to be a real alien. Although other classmates quickly take this as a joke, Umika sees this as a chance to finally make her dream come...true and befriend the mysterious and enchanting alien.Unfortunately, Yuu has no memories of her home planet and the reason why she was stranded on Earth. Umika and the friendly vice-class speaker Haruno Taragaki (in whose late grandfather\'s lighthouse Yuu has taken up residence) now want to help her reconstruct her memories and build a rocket with which they can fly into space.However, since their mathematical skills, which are necessary for building rockets, are developable, they decide to start small and build model rockets (""Moderu roketto""). The unequal quartet is completed by the explosive but technically gifted mechanic Raimon Matataki, who is conspicuous by her absence at school but has a very loose mouth.Together they want to fulfill their dream and fly to the stars.That\'s it. If you are looking for an anime with a dense plot, action, a complex story and multiple tricky plot twists, this is not the one for you. However, if you like quiet, heartwarming slice of life anime, Hoshikuzu Telepath is a goldmine.The anime is so wonderfully relaxing that it\'s a real treat to watch. If you look up “Cute” in the dictionary, there should definitely be a picture of Hoshikuzu Telepath in the future. Just Umika mentally talking to her pink mini aliens is one of the cutest things I\'ve ever seen. For example, one episode largely consists of watching the characters shopping for materials to build rockets - which was very entertaining. For me, it\'s a great art to use those unspectuacular settings and tell  such great and beautiful little stories from it.This anime is definitely carried by its characters. The relationship between Umika and Yuu is particularly captivating. You really notice from the first second that the two are made for each other. But also the other characters. It\'s one of the few anime where every character can be a potential Best Girl. There isn\'t a single one where you think, ""Uh, she\'s getting on my nerves.""My secret star of the series, however, is Raimon Matataki. Not only does she provide one or the other laughs with her lines, but she is also constantly responsible for explaining the physical background in the series. As a physics student, I am particularly fascinated that in this show, a rocket is not just builit casually during the lunch break in a SciFi-way and that technical details such as trajectories, angles and modeling are discussed in detail.The characters are confronted with realistic hurdles of building model rockets and it is incredibly inspiring to watch them continue to believe in themselves and achieve their dreams.It\'s an anime that not only promises a lot of yuri cuteness, but from which you can also learn a lot about yourself.The art style is very attractive. In particular, Umika\'s purple hair and everything that has to do with space and sunsets is particularly beautifully implemented.The seiyuu are mostly newcomers who have been lightly cast in the past - with the exception of Natsumi Takamori, who appropriately plays a teacher who looks after the newcomers. By the way, these are welcome to be filled more often.Miku Itu\'s OP invites you to dream of distant stars, before SoundOrion\'s ED sends you off into the night. The background music also brings out the space-theme very well at times.The anime really takes you away. You get excited about the characters, to see their development and you can take a lot with you. Umika and her friends teach us to believe in our dreams. This show will always have a special place in my heart.

"", 'Stardust Telepath - Reach for the stars...(erm, ahem) aliens in the sky...through some rocket building and good ol\' tried-and-true friendship tropes.The ever-so-popular Manga Time Kirara\'s CGDCT-themed anime adaptation has once again struck this season, and it should be a no-brainer that if you\'ve watched one show before of that premise, the rest will be the same no matter what. The differential, however, lies with the plot, and in this fall, brought to you by mangaka Rasuko Ookuma, this is Hoshikuzu Telepath a.k.a Stardust Telepath, a take on the ever-so-loving theme by combining the one element that makes it magical: the Yuri genre.I\'m sure that just...by the show alone, you would think that this is the first kind of CGDCT show to focus on the outer space side of things while having a ""plot"" that supports it by shooting rockets into space. But did you know that a similar formula has already been done, and it\'s by a long landslide of time forgotten? That would be mangaka Quro\'s Koisuru Asteroid a.k.a Asteroid in Love, which had Doga Kobo\'s Winter 2020 anime adaptation. For those old enough like me to have watched the latter back in the day, you can tell the inept similarities between both shows almost to the point of uncanniness (despite Koisuru Asteroid\'s manga coming out much earlier than Hoshikuzu Telepath) in pretty much everything, from the usual cute moe fluffiness to the deep character development moments, which to me, sadly, is almost like a carbon copy when put up in comparison.But there is a silver lining, and that Rasuko Ookuma\'s plot is derived from a Hitori ""Bocchi"" Gotou-like character meeting her support soulmate Nijika Ijichi, if she literally came from outer space. That\'s the story of Umika Konohoshi, the young girl who has a fascination with outer space and aliens, who became shy and introverted and finds it difficult to communicate her true feelings to others when that same fascination was ridiculed by others to the point of being very closed off. Like Bocchi, Umika develops social anxiety that\'s only further exacerbated by the amount of social isolation deriving from her liking of the supernatural, and she believes that she can only communicate with aliens and dreams of travelling to space in a rocket to visit them. That\'s where Yu Akeuchi comes in: the supposed alien character who somehow finds herself crashing on Earth, not knowing how it was ever done, and other than this causal effect that she now suffers from amnesia, she still desires to return home to space. This is where the worlds of both Umika and Yu collide as classmates, where, as much as the latter proclaims that she literally came from outer space, the class chooses not to believe it and takes it as a joke. Not so much for Umika, as she believes that this meeting marks a monumental moment in her life having an extraterrestrial as a dear friend whom she can talk to with her outer space aspirations. That\'s where the Yuri genre comes in with the tint of Yu\'s ""foreheadpathy"": the linking of foreheads with a person (similar to a kiss) that allows her to read their emotions.For the most part, Umika is a rather tame version of Bocchi, being a lot more quiet, timid, and petit-feeling as compared to the latter\'s social anxiety that warrants her not wanting to mingle and socialize with people. But what she makes up for in her weaknesses is the ""faith as little as a mustard seed"" level of confidence that grows over time of her conviction to want to travel to outer space, which Yu fervently supports because that\'s her only one-way ticket back to her home planet. And both Umika and Yu are never alone in this regard, as their class vice president Haruno Takaragi soon joins them in the same endeavour, aside from the fact that the small town\'s lighthouse that Yu has designated as her temporary dormitory just so happens to belong to her family, being a ""lighthouse connoisseur"". Together, the trio starts thinking about how they\'re going to send Yu back home in space and decides that they\'re going to start from scratch with the humble bottle rocket. But with their inept knowledge of experimenting with typical bottle rockets, they soon hit their stride and need someone with better expertise at helping them achieve their goal. This is where Matataki Raimon comes in as the mecha robot connoisseur, who has a penchant for mechanics and a passion for robots. However, Raimon is also a character who, like Umika, has her hobbies belittled by people, so much so that she engages in people-warfare by developing an aggressive and solitary disposition, aside from being the class dropout, being bitter, and not wanting to trust people ever again. It took Umika as many times as she could to convince the annoyingly persistent Raimon to help them build better bottle rockets, though this comes at the usual cost, which she has her own ego boost to fulfill while getting alienated by her own peers. And as par for the course of the ""usual CGDCT group of 4 girls"", their character developments, especially Umika and Raimon, who are peas in a pod, do work their usual charm, which is elevated by Yu\'s forehead ""kiss"" that provides that subtle distinction to stand out from the rest. Together with their class teacher, Akane Emihara, the Rocket Research hobby group gets its start in the rocket building mix.Director Kaori and Studio Gokumi are once again back on the CGDCT train after almost 5 years since Winter 2019\'s Endro~!, which is still my all-time favourite CGDCT show to ever exist. And I think they each did a decent job on bringing Rasuko Ookuma\'s story to life, full of its ""not-so-much-Koisuru Asteroid"" astronomy symbolism that it\'s as ever delightful to watch from a CGDCT perspective. Even the music can be aesthetically whimsical, from Miku Itou\'s rather surprisingly good OP song (which definitely fits the show to a T) to SoundOrion\'s ED song...which sounds rather meh-ish, but does contribute to the show\'s CGDCT-targeted theme.Most people would tell you that Hoshizuku Telepath is better than Koisuru Asteroid in terms of the story, plot, and characters. Heck, even to its subtle use of the Yuri elements, which I definitely agree with and found to be more enjoyable. But from a personal perspective, between both shows, I feel more for the latter, thanks to its musicality, which I still fondly remember after almost 4 years, that gives it the touch that edges better than this show.Still, don\'t take my word for it: Hoshikuzu Telepath is a good show with little to no problems at all; you might like it even more than I did. by the show alone, you would think that this is the first kind of CGDCT show to focus on the outer space side of things while having a ""plot"" that supports it by shooting rockets into space.

It took Umika as many times as she could to convince the annoyingly persistent Raimon to help them build better bottle rockets, though this comes at the usual cost, which she has her own ego boost to fulfill while getting alienated by her own peers. And as par for the course of the ""usual CGDCT group of 4 girls"", their character developments, especially Umika and Raimon, who are peas in a pod, do work their usual charm, which is elevated by Yu\'s forehead ""kiss"" that provides that subtle distinction to stand out from the rest. Together with their class teacher, Akane Emihara, the Rocket Research hobby group gets its start in the rocket building mix.Director Kaori and Studio Gokumi are once again back on the CGDCT train after almost 5 years since Winter 2019\'s Endro~!, which is still my all-time favourite CGDCT show to ever exist. And I think they each did a decent job on bringing Rasuko Ookuma\'s story to life, full of its ""not-so-much-Koisuru Asteroid"" astronomy symbolism that it\'s as ever delightful to watch from a CGDCT perspective. Even the music can be aesthetically whimsical, from Miku Itou\'s rather surprisingly good OP song (which definitely fits the show to a T) to SoundOrion\'s ED song...which sounds rather meh-ish, but does contribute to the show\'s CGDCT-targeted theme.Most people would tell you that Hoshizuku Telepath is better than Koisuru Asteroid in terms of the story, plot, and characters. Heck, even to its subtle use of the Yuri elements, which I definitely agree with and found to be more enjoyable. But from a personal perspective, between both shows, I feel more for the latter, thanks to its musicality, which I still fondly remember after almost 4 years, that gives it the touch that edges better than this show.Still, don\'t take my word for it: Hoshikuzu Telepath is a good show with little to no problems at all; you might like it even more than I did.', ""Stardust Telepath is extremely weird, but really started to warm up to me as the series carried on.  Through its bubbly characters, it hopes to strike some real emotion into you with its (almost) real, slice-of-life setting.Story: Stardust Telepath takes place in a middle school where the exceptionally anxious Umika Konohashi has a strange fascination with space and aliens.  Her dream is to create a rocket to one day travel to outer space, really, without any slight idea on how to do it.  However, one day, someone claiming to be an alien named Yuu Akeuchi appears in front of Umika and seems...to notice immediately that Umika’s far too anxious to communicate with any of her peers.  Being an alien, Yuu reveals she has the ability to sense someone else’s emotions and feeling by simply tapping her forehead to another human’s, known as Telepathy.  Eventually, the pair teams up with two others students, Haruno Takaragi and Matataki Raimon, and form a school club, known as the Rocket Research Hobby Group, that aims to creating model rockets to be able to fly, kind of in parallel with Umika’s dream.This series starts out exceptionally slow, in which not a whole lot of consequence happens, likely in part to create the setup it needs to carry out the back half of the story.  The first half basically consists of Yuu creating her club, recruiting members, finding a home base, and learning the basics of how to create model rockets.  Unfortunately, it really is quite bland, even if the series tries its best to appear quick, with our characters moving all over the place.  I get it, but such a slow start can chase some audiences away.That being said, the second half is where this series really starts to pick up the pace.  Without spoiling too much, our characters find real life applications to their hobby and find ways that they can have more fun along the way.  This creates a lot of really strong storylines, driven by themes such as teamwork, conflict resolution and bouncing back after you’ve been taken a step backwards.  The interactions between our characters specifically gets tested as the series goes on, especially when they discover the “sport” side of it.  I'm not entirely sure why this series is labeled as a Girls Love series, because it really doesn't hint at anything of the sort.  Think of it as a slice-of-life / school series and you're set.  (7/10)Characters: Umika is probably the most anxious anime character that I’ve seen in a lot time, if not, ever.  She get nervous at the slightly sliver of personal interaction and doesn’t take criticism well at all.  Starting at such a low point does create some room for character growth, and she does take steps to get there by the season wraps up.  She wouldn’t be able to take that growth without her group mates though.  Yuu isn’t really an interesting character though.  She’s mostly there for her Telepathy abilities, and outside of that, she’s mostly an obvious teenager, looking to launch rockets and not learn much along the way.  She’d be an okay support character, but she’s easily the weakest of our main cast.  Haruno, like Yuu, takes a very carefree and optimistic outlook on her studies and club activities.  She’s the most level-headed of the group and I’m not sure the group stays together without her.  The story takes a bit of a turn late, where we see that even the best and brightest aren’t invulnerable to breaking down every once in a while.  Raimon comes off as harsh, but her inclusion in this story was very welcome from my standpoint.  She clearly has the common interest like the other girls, but she’s quick to criticize when she doesn’t feel like others are learning at her pace and yells… a lot.  The differences between her and the others are so stark, but that’s why she’s great here.There aren’t a whole lot of side characters to speak of.  Umika’s sister Honami makes a few appearances, but isn’t much of anything.  Emihara are the girls’ homeroom teacher and eventual club advisor, but apart from barking the club rules, she really doesn’t do much of anything either.   Kei Akizuki, a middle schooler from another school, has some decent moments in the middle of the series and might be the only side character worth anything in the series.  (7/10)Art: Studio Gokumi is in charge of the animation here, and they have a history doing some colourful work in the past with series such as Tsurezure Children and Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero.  The animation is very crisp and consistent, and that’s not even to mention Umika’s gorgeous hair colour.  Backgrounds likely saw a little less attention, but that’s really not what you’re focusing on in this case.  (8/10)Sound: The sound really didn’t produce anything exceptional or terrible, though both the OP and ED felt pretty suitable for the series.  I can’t say anything was particularly off with the VA cast either - they did fine here.  (7/10)Overall: Stardust Telepath definitely has some strong points in where the girls’ club takes them, but getting there is a bit of a hurdle.  Still, I’ll definitely take an anime series that starts out slow and finishes strong over the opposite, any day.  Our four girls are very different from one another, and apart from the story near the end, it really sticks out as being a strongpoint of the series.  I wasn’t sure what to expect out of the series, but I’m happy with the direction they decided to take the girls’ rocket hobby, and would watch more if it continued.

A sweet yet sometimes melodramatic show of Girl meets Girl, with equal focus given to its subject matter (model rockets in this), and the relationships between characters.I suppose there's two things these hobbyist CGDCT shows need to get right:- Making the hobby appealing to people who otherwise do not care about the hobby- Make the characters interesting and fun to follow/easy to empathize withNow, where a lot of hobbyist shows falter in, is to make the show appeal only to people who are already into the hobby, or to make it very boring to everyone...else.

Of note is Matataki, and I'm surprised the show went kinda far with her bitchiness and perfectionism.

On the surface, Stardust Telepath might just seem like your typical CGDCT anime, but for me, this anime means a lot. What makes this the most underrated anime of this season (and the year) has to be the character dynamics. To be completely honest, all four main characters on their own probably wouldn’t stand on their own narratively speaking without the relationships with each other. Umika Konohoshi is an overly shy and introverted character who struggles to interact with literally anyone, but despite this, has big and literal otherworldly dreams that she wants to accomplish. I’d say that every other...character is written in a similar way: they have a very distinct personality with either big motivations or something they emotionally hold on that helps define who they are in the show. Yes, these characters are one-dimensional but what balances this out is the fact that the main four work better together as a group/pairs rather than individually being a strong character. This might seem like a downside, however this anime uses those dynamics to constantly push each character to aspire to be the best version of themselves. This means that the character development for someone like Umika and even Haruno Takaragi are very consistent and compelling. The other two main characters, Yuu Akeuchi and Haruno Takaragi, are your typical cute girls who act and do cute things but the writing in this series allow for these two to both help push the other characters to better themselves and form strong bonds with the main group as a whole. Akeuchi is honestly the glue that holds these four together since she is the most outgoing and vibrant character out of the four.Another aspect that I really appreciate from Stardust Telepath is that not everything is all sunshine and rainbows for our main cast. Throughout the twelve episodes of this season, all of the characters have their own personal struggles and desires that either sometimes clash with what the other characters want, or will have some emotional hiccups along the way. All four main characters have something that they struggle with that the others help fill the void in. This aspect alone is what made this such a special anime for me, since some of the things that all of the characters have to endure are things I have been through, which makes some episodes emotionally mean a lot to me. The drama in this series feels very real without being toxic and ultimately helps grow each character. Stardust Telepath is a great comfort anime while also dealing with very grounded personal struggles that I think many other people who have seen this anime can relate to. This anime is somewhat like the Bocchi the Rock of this season without the comedy and music; a series that consists of characters who represent many types of personalities, all with both collective and individual goals that pushes them out of their comfort zones in a way that helps them grow.

The space theme and wanting to build a rocket was a nice switch up from other similar shows more grounded in reality. It also had a good ending for the amount of story told, though I would love to see another season from it. Of course it's one of those where instead of kisses there are forehead touches but it was still nice to see such genuine love and affection without things getting pervy like in other shoujo ai series. I didn't really have any complaints. I had a good...time every episode.If you enjoy shoujo ai especially the cute ones then you'll like this one.

She believes that going to space is the only option for her to make friends, as she clams up when trying to interact with regular people. Surely, she thought, aliens would be much easier to talk to and make friends with.And of course, rather than dealing with her issues or problems, the story rather just presents an actual, living alien in front of Umika! I exaggerate a little. In reality, Akeuchi\'s appearance in Umika\'s life has little to do with her alien identity. This...show could have been just about Akeuchi, an energetic girl that becomes good friends with Umika. What Umika needed, as it turns out, wasn\'t alien friends or going to space, but rather encouragement and a space in where she is accepted for who she is, while also trying to self-improve as a person.That being said, is this show good? No. Bocchi the Rock has very similar synopsis and character regarding a girl with extreme social anxiety that eventually starts to open up her shell a little. The show features comedy, good characters, all the while also being focused on  progressing as a band. Each character is distinct, the dialogue being vibrant with the inclusion of Bocchi\'s erratic behavior, and the characters themselves have their own quirks.Going back to Hoshikuzu Telepath, you kind of just have moe-blobs that are unconfrontational and rather boring. Umika herself is quite boring, and none of the supporting cast develop beyond their boring archetype. Haruno especially makes me feel like she contributes nothing to all conversations and her introductory episode similarly feels like fille. Finally, a hobby club regarding building model rockets is fine, but the execution and actual progression of the club can only be seen as monotonous and lacking any engagement.If there was any salvation for the show, it would have been in the yuri content but there\'s no actual development there; just bait between Umika and Akeuchi.

Akeuchi is basically the only character that\'s remotely interesting to watch, so having her at the forefront similar to Kyouko from Yuru Yuri, where she sets the tempo with her energetic and whimsical personality.

I have reviewed some Gokumi anime before: Yuuki Yuuna wa Yusha de Aru, Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san, A-Channel and the god awful Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge. Let\'s hope this is more like the other stuff I\'ve reviewed of theirs and not that one.Story:Konohoshi Umika is an incredibly awkward girl who doesn\'t fit in with people in general. I relate. She dreams about going into space and meeting aliens who will understand her. I still relate. Her life is turned upside down when a strange girl arrives...at her school and declares herself to be an alien. Umika is immediately drawn to her. Can\'t relate to that one but I wish I could. The story involves their budding friendship, which quickly starts growing into more and their quest to build a rocket to take them both into space. Naturally, they start small with various forms of miniature rockets. Fortunately for them, they make some friends who can help them along.My only real issue with the story is that it stops dead in its tracks multiple times to explain the specifics of building model rockets. It really takes you out of the narrative when Raimon or Kei just starts going into ultra specific details about model rockets. I\'m sure someone will argue that ""it\'s educational"" but that doesn\'t make it narratively cohesive. All those PSAs that used to get added to the end of American cartoons were educational too but they were still the worst part.On the positive side, the anime is insanely cute. I appreciate the fact that its sci-fi elements are toned down to make it more relatable, including having the girls start small and do something within the realm of possibility for High School girls. Though I can get fully behind a more zany, over the top comedy there is something to be said for the more toned down, relatable approach. Most of the jokes are also really good. It also provides a solid sense of hardships and the girls going through a steep learning curve. They don\'t just become masters through a short montage or have some uncanny knack for building rockets. There\'s also a great little theme of finding a place to belong that we see all our main characters engage with to varying degrees.Characters:The thing I adore about the cast of characters is that they all have complexity, realistic motivations and character flaws. While I maintain that comedic characters don\'t necessarily need those attributes, it is nice to see ones who have them.Umika has extreme social anxiety and starts out only being comfortable with Yuu and her own relatives but we start to see her gradually putting an effort into socialising and the group of people she can talk to expands. Yuu has a much more extroverted outlook but that covers up a loneliness and sense of loss over not remembering who she is or where she came from. Haruno has a dream of helping others achieve their goals but in working with the others she starts to discover ambitions of her own. Raimon is obsessed with tinkering and feels isolated because no one can keep up with her so she pushes people away but Umika and the others may just be able to understand her.It\'s worth noting that these four also work very strongly together for comedic purposes. Their dynamics provide all kinds of possibilities for strong gags. They\'re also just downright adorable.Where the anime falters a bit is with the minor characters. Most of them are perfectly fine. They serve the function they need to and feel real enough. Then we have characters like the teacher or the little sister who just feel under-utilized. The situation will beg for them to do something more substantial than they end up doing.Art:I really love the character designs. The differently coloured highlights a lot of the girls have in their hair is really striking and the general designs are basically weaponised cuteness. They also go into great detail to make the various types of model rockets super accurate. The backgrounds are very good too.Sound:The cast is excellent. Funato Yurie, Fukagawa Seria, Aoki Shiki & Nagamuta Moe all have amazing performances. The music is great. Sakai Asuka did a phenomenal job.Ho-yay:There\'s a lot. All four of the major girls, Umika, Yuu, Haruno & Raimon have a level of les-yay that would make a polyamorous relationship amongst them believable. And it\'s ceaselessly adorable. Even the fact that they touch foreheads in multiple affectionate scenes like they adopted Jeremiah Rossa is cute. The les-yay is  strong betwixt Umika & Yuu. They have so many exceptionally cute moments.Areas of Improvement:1. We don\'t need long explanations of model rockets. Yes, they make it clear that you did your research but they also aren\'t very entertaining.2. The series really needs to do more with the bigger supporting characters. Even just a few extra lines to help flesh them out.3. More cute Sapphic moments would work a treat since they are one of the strongest aspects of the series.Final Thoughts:Hoshikozu Telepath stands alongside Gokumi\'s best work, Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san. It\'s an excellent series with some minor issues. My rating is going to be a 9/10. at her school and declares herself to be an alien. Umika is immediately drawn to her. Can\'t relate to that one but I wish I could. The story involves their budding friendship, which quickly starts growing into more and their quest to build a rocket to take them both into space. Naturally, they start small with various forms of miniature rockets. Fortunately for them, they make some friends who can help them along.My only real issue with the story is that it stops dead in its tracks multiple times to explain the specifics of building model rockets. It really takes you out of the narrative when Raimon or Kei just starts going into ultra specific details about model rockets. I\'m sure someone will argue that ""it\'s educational"" but that doesn\'t make it narratively cohesive. All those PSAs that used to get added to the end of American cartoons were educational too but they were still the worst part.On the positive side, the anime is insanely cute. I appreciate the fact that its sci-fi elements are toned down to make it more relatable, including having the girls start small and do something within the realm of possibility for High School girls. Though I can get fully behind a more zany, over the top comedy there is something to be said for the more toned down, relatable approach. Most of the jokes are also really good. It also provides a solid sense of hardships and the girls going through a steep learning curve. They don\'t just become masters through a short montage or have some uncanny knack for building rockets. There\'s also a great little theme of finding a place to belong that we see all our main characters engage with to varying degrees.Characters:The thing I adore about the cast of characters is that they all have complexity, realistic motivations and character flaws. While I maintain that comedic characters don\'t necessarily need those attributes, it is nice to see ones who have them.Umika has extreme social anxiety and starts out only being comfortable with Yuu and her own relatives but we start to see her gradually putting an effort into socialising and the group of people she can talk to expands. Yuu has a much more extroverted outlook but that covers up a loneliness and sense of loss over not remembering who she is or where she came from. Haruno has a dream of helping others achieve their goals but in working with the others she starts to discover ambitions of her own. Raimon is obsessed with tinkering and feels isolated because no one can keep up with her so she pushes people away but Umika and the others may just be able to understand her.It\'s worth noting that these four also work very strongly together for comedic purposes.

It\'s like Bocchi the Rock, if Bocchi was completely without talent or character growth. If you\'re someone who doesn\'t get into the fetishization of mental illness, then you probably wont like this. Literally all this anime is would be  ""protecc the cute helpless animal"" with some yuri baiting.Yes the character designs and animation are good. The base story plot is somewhat interesting. But I watched weekly the first 7 weeks and it was tough to get through the last few weeks. Each week the protags voice and way of...talking got more and more grating.  I have social anxiety, and know many who do.  None of us talk like this and stutter -every-single-syllable. Let alone in a whiny baby voice. Its a cheap stereotype played to appeal her cuteness to the target demographic of those who want to protect her. That\'s all. The loose semi-interesting plot (cute girls building model rockets) was not enough to offset the annoyingness of other aspects of the anime. I stopped quarter of the way through episode 8 the day it came out, and decided today to try and finish it off since it had finished airing.  I made it through another quarter of the episode before punting it to the dropped list. No way I could handle another 4.5 episodes of this. The constant stuttering of the protag and the ""tsundere"" just ripping on the protag was too much, and I remembered why I stopped watching in the first place. I say ""tsundere"" since that word lately seems more and more exaggerated and an excuse to be a total b*tch to everyone rather than a genuine story device.In all, this was a show that had potential but failed on execution, in a strong Fall 2023 Lineup where it was overshadowed at every turn. Still, I\'m sure  many will enjoy based solely on the cute girls, but that just isn\'t enough for me. talking got more and more grating.  I have social anxiety, and know many who do.

This anime got the potential to be one of the anime comedy classics of all time for sure.There\'s literally nothing this anime does wrong, and everything about it is great (for a fantasy comedy anime), so let me instead state some very outstanding things this anime got:1. Characters: The character in this anime is spotless, everyone feels alive and look amazing. They are not just npcs and actually make the viewers want to follow through their story too.2. Comedy: This anime not only got...good anime, it also got the good creative animation to get along with it. Also since it\'s not a slice of life, but is a fantasy, many comedy aspect is very unique for the fantasy settings, so you won\'t find many boring comedy troupe here.3. The MCs: The mc is not just your typical ""shut in relatable mc"" too. Since this is fantasy, the shut in aspect is very interesting and unique.4. The animation & production quality: Studio Project No.9 really outdid themselves with this one. The animation is PHENOMENAL, on par with Kaguya sama love is war. Plus it does support the comedy REALLY well and creatively.5. Story & world: This anime got a VERY interesting world building and story for an anime, without going into spoilers, the world is BUILD so creatively with anything possibly imaginable in it. The world building while isn\'t in the spotlight much, is outstanding for an comedy fantasy anime. The story around this world right now (ep3) is good, and got cared for. Also that the story played into the comedy so much as well, so it does fell like events happening in this world impact her life.Quick review run down:1. Production quality 10/10 : Outstanding animation, with up to standard sound effects and OST, definitely in the top tiers of animations of anime in general.2.

I just wanna rest in peace, and good day!"" *slams door* - Terakomari ""Komari"" GandesbloodOut of all of the many Fall season\'s offerings, I have to say that author Kotei Kobayashi\'s Hikikomari Kyuuketsuki no Monmon a.k.a The Vexations of a Shut-In Vampire Princess is one of those works that is the definition of a one-of-a-kind work that you don\'t really see experimented much in the AniManga space. This LN that started in January 2020 , which would go on to win the...Excellence award in SoftBank Creative\'s GA Bunko label (which is where works like DanMachi, Goblin Slayer etc. come from) in its 11th iteration, you know that this work is no slouch at all, and with Project No. 9\'s anime, it has earned its fans for better and for worse.Meet Terakomari ""Komari"" Gandesblood: The second born daughter of the prestigious and powerful Gandesblood family, she has to do the typical thing of familial successors to take up the mantle of her predecessor...except for one issue. She may be a vampire, but the big problem is her inability to consume blood or utilize magic, and decided to live as the title suggests: as a shut-in princess. What\'s worse is that in her kingdom of the Mulnite Empire, her father holds a formidable position as one of the kingdom\'s strongest fighters and generals, dubbed the Seven Crimson Lords, and she automatically becomes one of them after being passed the torch thereafter, which she refuses to accept as reality. Guess what? After 3 years of being a shut-in, she\'s suddenly being promoted by the kingdom\'s Empress as a commander of the Mulnite Imperial Army, specifically the 7th Unit, full of warriors from psychos to ruffians and criminals — that is a 250-soldier strong army! With this context in mind, begins Komari\'s scuffleness in trying to deal with the big figures in her kingdom and her newly appointed soldiers as well, with the help of her personal maid Villhaze, all in the hopes that she won\'t be seen as a rebel who will have people turn against her.Right away, this show is pretty much a character-driven complex story as we see Komari\'s rise to ""fame"" even at the behest of such titles ""unnecessarily"" bestowed on her, whom the others see as a ""fit of trickery"" that she is the leader suited for them as a ruthless warlord who ""promises"" to conquer the world. But beneath that façade lies a past that Komari doesn\'t want to come to light, as much as other people would come to realize of her ""heritage"" with the Gandesblood name. Komari\'s one and only solace is her personal maid Villhaze, and if you still don\'t get the fantasy comedy genre with the Yuri overtones, the blue-haired thirsty maid is just that, wanting to get into her good graces while literally ""kissing her feet"" with all sorts of zaniness that makes Komari all the more disgusted with her, though she can really deliver when it comes ot the crunch. That\'s literally the best part about the show, and as it attempts to dive deep into the war-bootlicking with characters moulded from the typical evil organization to bring in characters such as Millicent Bluenight, Sakuna Memoir, and others (of which they played a part in Komari\'s upbringing), I can\'t help but feel sympathy for these characters...but also for the story elements, of which it really just can\'t decide what to be. Say, the everlasting trope of ""the power of friendship""? It\'s there, and you can\'t really unsee it. But soon, when Komari\'s real powers are involved, that\'s what makes her who she really is, worthy of the Gandesblood name that\'s pretty much not just the daughter\'s incapability but of a power that could potentially decimate the world. That\'s how unassuming Komari is from the outside, being a child, turned into an adult once she really gets all ham and going. If you really have to pick the star of the show, it\'ll definitely be Komari and Villhaze.I really adore VA Tomori Kusunoki for her wide range of diversity, at least for this year, with the notables being Maou Gakuin\'s Misha Necron, Winter\'s TsunLise of Liselotte Riefenstahl, Summer\'s Zom 100 of Shizuka Mikazuki, and this season\'s Buta no Liver of Jess Yethma (though not her finest work). But aside from Zom 100, her performance as Komari really (and I mean REALLY) stood out as one of her finest performances this year, being the front and centre MC for the show in a great way, making it very pronounced that Komari is here not just to sleep her ass off, but to cause trouble and bring karma for all who are in her way.Nevertheless, I need to address the elephant in the room: the kinda 3rd-rate studio that is Project No. 9 being assigned to 3 simultaneous shows at the same time: this, Ojou to Banken-kun a.k.a A Girl & Her Guard Dog (which had the WORST production quality), and Buta no Liver wa Kanetsu Shiro a.k.a ButaReba -The Story of a Man Who Turned into a Pig- (which was 2nd worst). Not once was this done to an insane degree than studio Liden Films, with 4 shows running concurrently during Winter 2021, and subsequent seasons having 3 shows concurrently thereafter throughout 2021 and 2022. But to be fair, Liden Films is in a whole other ballpark than Project No. 9, and they CAN handle up to 3/4 shows at ease without melting in production hell. But for the latter studio, it\'s clear that not only is this agonizing to the staff teams, but in a similar situation that\'s close on par with the likes of MAPPA, they just can\'t handle this much, and suffering a delay in this day and age is just the norm to expect going forward. For this show, it\'s clear that the priority went to this show, and despite it looking kind of jarring, it\'s pretty decent and is as close to what you\'ll expect from the studio.That said, fripSide\'s return without its forefront singer Yoshino Nanjo since her graduation in April 2022, certainly does feel like a new era of the iconic J-Pop group with new singers Mao Uesugi and Hisayo Abe taking the helm since Spring 2022\'s Mahoutsukai Reimeiki a.k.a The Dawn of the Witch\'s OP song, which was (and still is) meh. This time with ""Red Liberation"", I\'d say that this is a rather decent and competent song that\'s within the likes of the famed group, though still not close to what Yoshino Nanjo could muster herself, but hey, baby steps to get back to where they are. But the ED song, oh man, MIMiNARI really pimped herself with Tomori Kusunoki (Komari\'s VA) to produce one hell of a banger, but soothing song...which literally means ""I Can\'t Sleep"". It\'s a great song for all you sleepyheads who suffer from insomnia and desperately need to get some sleep.Apart from this show being somewhat entertaining, as it is boring (at times), the vampire princess that we now know and love (somewhat to a degree) can be a riot in the right circumstances, though just as lazy when she likes it.Regardless, for a princess who is just as happy and lax but as cold and OP as she is, what\'s not to love about Komari? A sleeping princess is as easy to tempt and tease.

But for the latter studio, it\'s clear that not only is this agonizing to the staff teams, but in a similar situation that\'s close on par with the likes of MAPPA, they just can\'t handle this much, and suffering a delay in this day and age is just the norm to expect going forward. For this show, it\'s clear that the priority went to this show, and despite it looking kind of jarring, it\'s pretty decent and is as close to what you\'ll expect from the studio.That said, fripSide\'s return without its forefront singer Yoshino Nanjo since her graduation in April 2022, certainly does feel like a new era of the iconic J-Pop group with new singers Mao Uesugi and Hisayo Abe taking the helm since Spring 2022\'s Mahoutsukai Reimeiki a.k.a The Dawn of the Witch\'s OP song, which was (and still is) meh. This time with ""Red Liberation"", I\'d say that this is a rather decent and competent song that\'s within the likes of the famed group, though still not close to what Yoshino Nanjo could muster herself, but hey, baby steps to get back to where they are. But the ED song, oh man, MIMiNARI really pimped herself with Tomori Kusunoki (Komari\'s VA) to produce one hell of a banger, but soothing song...which literally means ""I Can\'t Sleep"". It\'s a great song for all you sleepyheads who suffer from insomnia and desperately need to get some sleep.Apart from this show being somewhat entertaining, as it is boring (at times), the vampire princess that we now know and love (somewhat to a degree) can be a riot in the right circumstances, though just as lazy when she likes it.Regardless, for a princess who is just as happy and lax but as cold and OP as she is, what\'s not to love about Komari? A sleeping princess is as easy to tempt and tease.', 'Reading the synopsis, I thought this show would be a misunderstanding comedy.I got scammed. You\'d think that appointing a weak vampire who can\'t drink blood as a general that has to fight in war, deal with rebels who want to overthrow her, and command armies would be fun to watch. Terakomari, the protagonist would have to jump through hoops and manage her troops stringently in order to survive. In many cases, she will have to pretend she\'s smarter than she is, stronger than she is, and more ruthless than anybody else. All while being a hikikomori that wants nothing more than to lounge in bed.But...no, that\'s not how it works. And it boils down to the premise itself. Terakomari was born in a noble family, where her father\'s in a powerful position in the Mulnite Empire. Through a simple misunderstanding, her father beseeches the Queen to grant her the title of general. The problem is the lack of desperation in this story. I get that it\'s a comedy, but isn\'t it comical that Terakomari\'s in a pretty good spot? She\'s rich, her family is in power, and her back\'s not really against the wall. She even gets a convenient, loyal, and somewhat powerful maid that does her bidding.To top off the dumb premise, you have the fact that nobody can die, as they revive under the magical powers of a ""dark core"" that each kingdom possesses. So, what\'s the point of war? It\'s answered by the story itself: it\'s for entertainment purposes. You\'re basically just given the easiest circumstances in the world. Suddenly, fighting as a commander is more like playing a real time strategy game rather than actual war. Again, Terakomari is in a contract because she doesn\'t want to die, and she has to fight in order to survive. Yet...she can\'t fucking die. You get why this story sucks? There\'s some discourse and an ""evil organization"" that wants to kill people for good, but honestly, trying to inject some cringe boring edgy organization into a failing comedic plot just won\'t cut it for me.Finally, and the most cringe thing in the story (SPOILER WARNING EP 4). Unfortunately, the spoiler is truly a dealbreaker, so I had to include it.she\'s just an OP vampire that can kill anything anyways, she\'s not even weak. What\'s the point of this show? It\'s just a generic power fantasy story at that point. It doesn\'t help that all the jokes are extremely unfunny, and most of them hinge on Terakomari being teased, acting cute, embarrassed, or otherwise being sexualized like crazy.Compared to something like Tearmoon Kingdom, where it\'s also a young, cute princess that needs to do things for her survival, the directions both shows go are completely divergent. Tearmoon Kingdom sticks with the misunderstanding premise, the protagonist is weak, and there are some real stakes at hand.Overall, don\'t come into this show with comedy in mind, nevermind comedic misunderstandings.

Out of Project No. 9s three shows this season, I think this was the best by a decent margin. It was a perfect blend of Yuri, ecchi fanservice, action and wholesome moments too. A must watch for cute girl enthusiasts.Hikikomari isn’t going to blow you away with world building or an incredible story. Its strength is very clearly the relationship between characters, mainly Vill and Komari, the misunderstandings that make Komarin look like a genius and...the Yuri undertones. These were more than enough to make up for the weaker story for me. The comedy really landed and seeing Komarin thrust into this leadership position she’s totally unqualified for was hilarious. I couldn’t help but be reminded of Tanya from Youjo senki as well as Ainz.Komarin’s journey from a socially awkward shut in vampire to such a prominent leadership position is only possible thanks to the friends she makes along the way. The chemistry between she and her maid Vill expertly toes the line between straight up gay and just plain wholesome. I loved seeing Komarin gradually open up to Vill as the show progressed. As with many of these types of shows, it starts as a one sided affair before Komarin realises just how important Vill has become to her which I thought was really cute. There’s several other supporting characters that get their own little mini arcs throughout the show who each help Komarin grow progressively more confident in herself and help turn her into a better leader. While it’s only 12 episodes so some of that progression is expedited, it still managed to feel rewarding to meI’m a big fan of the ecchi in this one. Some of it is overt like the beach episode, while most of the time it’s more subtle garter belt shots, thigh shots, camera angles, etc. I think it manages to give just enough fanservice while not degrading the girls too much. I know that sounds a bit weird, but I kind of like when shows leave a little to the imagination if that makes sense.The one criticism I have with this show is the story seems to not know what it wants to be. There’s episodes that are light hearted and jokey, then you’ll get a darker edgy story, then a battle shonen fight.. it’s just kind of aimless at this point. Now I know there’s 13 or so LNs available so I’m sure at some point the story takes shape, but from what we saw in the anime it was kind of meh until the last 3 episodes or so. Therefore, I can’t suggest you come into this one with strong expectations on that front. It’s very much a sit back, vibe and relax type of anime.It seems like Project No. 9 put their best team on this one as well. In stark contrast to butareba and ojou to banken kun, the production values in this were pretty good. There’s a decent amount of action and it looks solid in here. Komarin’s hype power up moments look great, the fights are well done and the day to day animation delivered.Hikikomari was one of my top 10 most anticipated shows of the season and it finished the season there as well. It’s a very enjoyable watch that makes up for a subpar story with loveable characters and comedy. I’m always going to enjoy cute vampire girls doing magical stuff, so it all worked out for me.

What started out as a promising story that seemed to be a yuri fantasy slice of life turned out to be a hodgepodge of ideas that in the end lead to nothing, as it is a headless story that doesn\'t exactly know what it wants to be. In some chapters it pretends to be an ecchi comedy (when in reality it is not of the comedy genre), in others it gets ""dark"" and edgy and in others it seems it wants to emulate Shonen by giving the protagonist power-ups that come...out of nowhere so she can easily beat any challenges in her path no matter how apparently difficult they are.The characters are the weakest point of this anime since they all turn out to be flat and one-note, especially Komarin. She is a Mary Sue protagonist who appears to be weak but all that turns out to be a facade since she is exaggeratedly OP because not only the power she obtains came from nowhere but she also gains it for free and cheaply, which removes any possibility of development because it is non-existent. And if her Mary Sue power wasn\'t enough, we have her personality which is completely annoying as she acts like a capricious, stuck-up, obnoxious, and irritable, which makes impossible to empathize with her. Other characters like Villhaze, Sakuna Memoir, Karen and the rest of the cast do absolutely nothing, are relegated to the background and lack enough depth to make you care about them.Another of its biggest failures is the lack of consequences and risks. In several of its episodes they try to set up a conflict only for one episode later to turn out to be completely irrelevant, all thanks to its inconsistent and rushed narrative. The fact that the characters cannot die at all and are revived within the world in which the story takes place takes away from the plot since it makes us not care about anyone because we know for sure that they will revive.The villains or antagonists are another point against that affects the quality of this series. You can\'t have a well-told story without a good villain, and this series portrays that in a negative way. None of the villains feel threatening or like any real danger to the protagonist since not only they are flat and lack depth but they also only exist so that Komarin can show off her powers and defeat them in less than a minute. Millicent Bluenight and Odilon Metal are clear examples, instead of being threatening and dangerous they turn out to be incompetent fools who do not do nothing and serve as annoyance to the plot, which makes the Team Rocket Trio look like more competent characters in comparison.The humor in this series is disgusting. They only limit themselves to tell the typical pervert jokes that you would see in any ecchi anime and the typical joke of ""ah, the person I fell in love with left me for someone else"", which is not only unfunny, but is also repetitive, diarrheal and extremely annoying that ends up taking away the tension or drama in situations that we are supposed to take seriously.In conclusion, Vexations of a Shut In Vampire Princess is a mediocre and terrible series, with an extremely inconsistent narrative that lacks risks and clear direction, characters that are flat and are as interesting as a blank sheet of paper, a Mary Sue protagonist who is unlikable, weak villains and generic world building. Therefore, the series in general seems more like a poorly written Wattpad fanfic made by an otaku who is obsessed with Genshin Impact rather than a true story. Due to these reasons I do not recommend anyone to watch this garbage.

In regards for the story first few episodes are boring and as predictable as they can get. Storyline does not get much better later on and characters are skin deep (but their skin are sure is pretty). I struggle to comprehend how this had LN source material, as it is so naive and basic. There is no struggle or some main theme which you can pick up, as far as I can see. MC just have cheat skill with which she was born. Then she is going with the flow, following some whimsical ideals...based on nothing. No consequences of her choices, no death for her allies.Anyway, quality is pretty good, battles look decent.

Both have equally annoying loli MCs.', ""Hikikomari kyuuketsuki no monmon is one of the most interesting anime in fall 2023. The vampire girl, named Terakomari Gandesblood or Komari seems like an ordinary girl who enjoys her life as a shut-in. She considered herself as the weakest vampire. But little did she knew, she got special “abilities” and not the weakest. Alongside with her awesome maid, Villhaze, she embarked on her journey to fool everyone to thinking that she is not the weakest, but in reality she is super powerful. Together they try to face their enemies who are threatened by Komari’s past and her popularity as a Crimson Lord. They also...meets their new friends along the way. This anime serves some great gags, incredible animations, awesome supporting characters, top notch VA, and many more which will be explained in the paragraphs below.Story (8/10)The stories mainly is focusing on some comedies and sometimes to resolve the problems that faced by Komari as a MC or other people. It starts with some gags but in the next part it contains a lot of backstories that can make viewers enjoy the plot. It starts the MC as a funny and loveable person then start getting serious with MC’s past and other character issues. It developed the main character to become the better person with kind heart. But the downpoint of this plot is some storylines is a bit fast pacing which didn’t explain some aspects of the story clearly like the ways of dark core works or when someone using ritual article or not that can make the watchers a bit confuse. Another downpoint is that the ending feels ordinary and not special at all where some previous episodes better serves as the ending than the actual ending. Overall, the story had some great backstories with simple forwarding story with comical gags throughout the screening of this anime.Art (10/10)The style of art in this anime is really beautiful and corresponds with its genre which are comedy and fantasy. The representation of the places is drawn beautifully. The art for its gag is well executed with great facial expression and goofy styles. But most importantly the animation for the fighting scene is astonishing. They give incredible effects and focus on the detail such as adding swollen faces, blood splatters, and a little gore effect that makes the viewers hype up for the battle scenes. Well done!Sound (8/10)Let's talk about their seiyuu first. The seiyuus were incredible at voicing each every one of the character. For example, Komari voiced by Tomori Kusonoki had this cheerful and pure type of voice that depicts her personality. Even the supporting character has incredible voice like Milicent with a voice that depicts her as a cunning villain or Sakuna with her low and shy girl type of voice. I am amazed by the wide range of tone and pitch of each character. Unfortunately, the OP and ED song feels lacking and seems common like ordinary OP and ED. But on the bright side, the background music is variative and supports the scene really well. Some even better with playing vampire-like themes using organ instruments. Sound aspect is still great though.Character (9/10)The personality of each character really showed up in this anime. Main character with her silliness and yet capable of creating meaningful situation in the story. Each side characters also showed some distinctive nature like shy character, merciless character, etc. What a great display of personalities from each character.Enjoyment (9/10)If you want to watch chilled anime, then this anime will be a perfect choice. The story mostly is light, but yet sometimes it can get serious too. The comedy in this anime is on point not too much and not too little. The vampire theme really depicted really well in this anime, that totally showcase the vampire’s lifestyle. And dont forget the incredible animation and art, that makes this anime looks aesthetic with a lot of great additional effects. But unfortunately, the plot sometimes didn’t explain wholly and can be stale at some point. But overall, i really enjoy this masterpiece.Hikikomari kyuuketsuki no monmon is one of the great underrated anime in fall 2023. It presented the comedy anime that still had great storyline. While still offering vampire type fantasy anime, the animation was astonishing and the voice acting was spot on. This anime highly recommended for you who wants to enjoy lightweight anime with great humour with decent plot. Even though this anime focusing on the gags and jokes, the quality of the other aspects still maintained really well. Appreciation for the whole production team, hopefully this anime can release its second season in the future. meets their new friends along the way. This anime serves some great gags, incredible animations, awesome supporting characters, top notch VA, and many more which will be explained in the paragraphs below.Story (8/10)The stories mainly is focusing on some comedies and sometimes to resolve the problems that faced by Komari as a MC or other people. It starts with some gags but in the next part it contains a lot of backstories that can make viewers enjoy the plot. It starts the MC as a funny and loveable person then start getting serious with MC’s past and other character issues. It developed the main character to become the better person with kind heart. But the downpoint of this plot is some storylines is a bit fast pacing which didn’t explain some aspects of the story clearly like the ways of dark core works or when someone using ritual article or not that can make the watchers a bit confuse. Another downpoint is that the ending feels ordinary and not special at all where some previous episodes better serves as the ending than the actual ending. Overall, the story had some great backstories with simple forwarding story with comical gags throughout the screening of this anime.Art (10/10)The style of art in this anime is really beautiful and corresponds with its genre which are comedy and fantasy. The representation of the places is drawn beautifully. The art for its gag is well executed with great facial expression and goofy styles. But most importantly the animation for the fighting scene is astonishing. They give incredible effects and focus on the detail such as adding swollen faces, blood splatters, and a little gore effect that makes the viewers hype up for the battle scenes. Well done!Sound (8/10)Let's talk about their seiyuu first. The seiyuus were incredible at voicing each every one of the character. For example, Komari voiced by Tomori Kusonoki had this cheerful and pure type of voice that depicts her personality. Even the supporting character has incredible voice like Milicent with a voice that depicts her as a cunning villain or Sakuna with her low and shy girl type of voice. I am amazed by the wide range of tone and pitch of each character. Unfortunately, the OP and ED song feels lacking and seems common like ordinary OP and ED. But on the bright side, the background music is variative and supports the scene really well. Some even better with playing vampire-like themes using organ instruments. Sound aspect is still great though.Character (9/10)The personality of each character really showed up in this anime. Main character with her silliness and yet capable of creating meaningful situation in the story. Each side characters also showed some distinctive nature like shy character, merciless character, etc. What a great display of personalities from each character.Enjoyment (9/10)If you want to watch chilled anime, then this anime will be a perfect choice. The story mostly is light, but yet sometimes it can get serious too. The comedy in this anime is on point not too much and not too little. The vampire theme really depicted really well in this anime, that totally showcase the vampire’s lifestyle. And dont forget the incredible animation and art, that makes this anime looks aesthetic with a lot of great additional effects. But unfortunately, the plot sometimes didn’t explain wholly and can be stale at some point. But overall, i really enjoy this masterpiece.Hikikomari kyuuketsuki no monmon is one of the great underrated anime in fall 2023. It presented the comedy anime that still had great storyline. While still offering vampire type fantasy anime, the animation was astonishing and the voice acting was spot on. This anime highly recommended for you who wants to enjoy lightweight anime with great humour with decent plot.

There are copious amounts of gushing blood and some less than funny type of violence, but it's not gruesome or too serious. Maybe don't show this to a young kid.We have an unwilling protagonist, Terakomari Gandesblood, who is put in position of leading one of her country's armies as its commander, despite being a teenager shut-in vampire who refuses to drink blood.Hilarity ensues...as she must pretend to be incredibly competent and powerful in order to stay in control of her soldiers. In addition she has been supplied with a beautiful and deadly maid who helps enable this deception, while also fawning over Terakomari and attempting salaciously to entice her.That last part is entirely yuri-bait (promising female on female intimacy without delivering it) and played off as a running joke, there is no yuri at all and while there is some fanservice and a tiny bit of ecchi, it's mostly tasteful or downplayed and used for emphasis.I make a note of it because some people go into these shows expecting something specific.It's a chuunibyou show because it's not meant to be seriously, but still wants to impart some drama and epic moments despite there not being the weight behind such a premise, meaning there's no story long establishment of antagonists or a deep character arc ala Guts from Berserk, to drive her on. It's all in-the-moment tomfoolery.It's meant to be somewhat superficial entertainment with pretty girls in cool outfits, using high fantasy magic in spectacular scenes of devastation. It accomplishes what it sets out to do fairly well I think.There's a fairly large amount of tropes, but despite having seen it all before I don't feel like they're too heavy handed with them. There are the occasional 'villain exposition' scenes, but that's the worst of it I think. as she must pretend to be incredibly competent and powerful in order to stay in control of her soldiers.

I like the concept of taking the tired fantasy genre and adding a goofy twist to it, which in this case is having a shut-in vampire venture into the outside world, making friends, and commanding an army. The best parts of this anime come from the goofiness in the main character, Terakomari Gandesblood, and all of the interactions between her and everyone else. The show doesn’t take itself seriously for the most part mainly due to the anime revolving around a shut-in trying to figure out both army and political stuff while having fun banter with...all of the side characters. The comedic elements of the show are executed well while also having some great moments for the characters to be fleshed out. Some of the side characters in the anime, like Villhaze, Sakuna Memoir, and Nelia, have great backstories and are given just enough screen time to develop them and give them compelling motivations. Even some of the villains like Millicent were well-written enough to make you hate them and see the heroes defeat them. That said, the biggest issue of this anime has to be the fact that there are times when the show tries too hard to focus on the actual political climate of the story. Near the end of the season, there’s this big war that breaks out between several nations, and both the build-up and even the execution of that arc tried to make everything seem so dire. I get that the purpose of this is to ultimately progress Terakomari into a much better leader, but trying to showcase bleak things like a government experimenting on human subjects and oppressing its citizens while having our main characters quip at each other feels a bit tonally inconsistent. I feel like these plot points where the heroes are trying to expose one of the nations for committing these crimes should have had more time to be fleshed out since this kind of comes out of nowhere. Regardless, the show as a whole still sticks the landing in terms of fleshing out Terakomari and giving her goofy moments while she somewhat grows out of her introverted shell. all of the side characters.

Don't let its seemingly light-hearted genre tags fool you; this series is full of fang-tastic character development and emotionally stirring moments. From the outset, it's clear that this anime is something special. The animation quality is well done, especially during the flashy and entertaining fight scenes. The pacing is just right; each arc is presented in bite-sized portions, introducing new characters and delving into their backgrounds and motivations, while highlighting the central character's growth and evolution. However, while the series maintains a strong narrative overall, the final arc falls short in comparison...to its predecessors. The introduction of numerous characters without proper development leaves a bit to be desired, detracting from the otherwise compelling storyline. Another drawback worth noting is that some character designs are overly similar, making characters difficult to distinguish at times. Despite this, the exceptional writing and engaging plot make it worth pushing through any minor confusion. It's important not to judge Hikikomari Kyuuketsuki no Monmon solely by its over-the-top cute demeanor. This anime can be surprisingly violent and bloody at times, adding depth to its storytelling and keeping viewers on their toes. Sinking our teeth into a final thought, Hikikomari Kyuuketsuki no Monmon is a standout anime that deserves a watch. It surpasses expectations with its great character development, well-paced narrative, and emotionally resonating moments.

Out  of the random mangas the bookstore had, it looked like it had the most potential out of them since it was about a protagonist put into an uncomfortable environment rather than another boring story about an OP MC. I was a bit disappointed but I watched the anime to see how the story progressed since there were some original ideas in the book and I hoped the author would make good use of them. Unfortunately, not.The world...of VoaVP features multiple nations fighting each other, which isn\'t really explained why; the author makes almost zero attempt to write about the politics of this world. But there is a twist here, when people die in this world they get revived at no cost. It sounds like the start of some intriguing worldbuilding, but sadly the author doesn\'t make much attempt to develop their world around this key trait. The revival thing is used more for plot convienience rather than explore a world shaped by the fact that people don\'t die.The main character, Terakomari, our vampire princess, is a vampire pretty much in name only. She doesn\'t need to drink blood, she isn\'t harmed by sunlight, and she doesn\'t possess any powers that would make her uniquely vampiric. She\'s not really a princess either, but I guess the author loves very loose definitions. At least the part about her being a shut-in is true, and not having any talent when it comes to the position she was hired for. So we get to see her attempting to boast and bullshit her way through which is the better part of the story. Her interactions with her subordinate soldiers whilst keeping up her facade is fun, like when she agrees to and does a rap battle with one of them to win him over. Carrying on with the wit on the Terakomari\'s end would be great, but the author be like ""fuck it, let\'s give her super strong hidden powers anyway"" and gives up on the imposter syndrome thing. Now VoaVP is another boring OP MC story. What a shame. The reason for keeping up the facade is lacking too. The MC doesn\'t want to die, which isn\'t high stakes in a world where people revive the next day. There are other things to put at stake that would work much better, like relationships, reputation, or even exposing the Terakomari\'s embarrasing romance novels that she wrote. Yeah, the author didn\'t put much thought into this.Terakomari gets a loyal maid called Vilhaze. Vilhaze has a very strong perversion to Terakomari to the point of sexual harassment which gets branded as humor. Typical anime ecchi shit. At least it\'s not as bad as in the book, and that Terakomari\'s age isn\'t mentioned so that the viewer doesn\'t feel like a pedophile for watching it. Other than that, Vilhaze\'s serious personality works well with Terakomari bumbling through her job and Vilhaze doing sketchy things like poisoning Terakomari\'s rivals is fun.The other side characters are often written decently, with surface level appearances which hide layers of motivations and backstory which get exposed later in the story. There\'s also Terakomari\'s idiot misfit soldiers which whilst they are simpler than Terakomari\'s girl friends, are fun to watch. Terakomari\'s childhood bully is also a highlight.While the story starts off well, the world is explained so little that while the story expanded to the wider world it is hard to be immersed with the world events that go on or what Terakomari\'s actions have on the world. When the story focused on Terakomari trying to get through her obstacles and hide her incompetance, it was fine. Of course when it was revealed that Terakomari is actually super OP, the story was cracking and the tension the viewer had for our weak little vampire was lost. An oddity after this point, is that Terakomari\'s OP powers are kept secret to her by her maid and her father. Why? No explaination. It just is. So we have this ridiculous situation where Terakomari still thinks she\'s incompetent and trying to hide it whilst she actually isn\'t. It\'s irritating to come into a story about a weak person trying to get better and struggle through the challenges of the day, only to turn out that the weak person was actually a strong person all along. Not just all along, but also that she didn\'t do anything to achieve this strength. A lot of sympathy was lost for her at this point.The animation is as basic as you can get.VoaVP starts off quite strong, but is so lacking in worldbuilding and story and the author can\'t handle the premise without quickly diving into the same dull tropes that plagues the genre.

I did not have high expectations starting this show, in fact, I was prepared to drop it within the first 3 episodes. However, I quickly realized that this typical trashy harem power fantasy show actually had some substance to it.The Story: Our main protagonist in this show is a vampire princess, Terakomari Gandesblood, a teenage shut-in who refuses to drink blood like other vampires. As a result, she has found herself to be quite weak and, thus, is absolutely horrified by the idea of participating in society due to judgment....Unlucky for her, she gets the news from her maid, Vill, that she's actually going to be a commander for the queen and fight, to the death, over and over. This obviously does not go over well, and throughout the show, this aspect becomes *very* repetitive. This is probably the worst part of the show. There is a general feeling of stillness. This show struggles with repeating the same issues over and over, all resolved not by Terakomari herself but by her harem. As viewers, there are very few times that there is any tension because of this, which is relatively uninteresting in the long run.The Characters: While the aspect of repetitiveness does annoy me, I think the characters are what makes this show so enjoyable. Even though this is a yuri-bait harem show, all of our, I guess, 'leads' have backgrounds and a unique place within the story. Moreover, the characters here do show layers and promise of change. We get to see some characters totally evolve and show their strengths. Also, the designs are all super cool; even the side male characters are quite unique and fun to watch.Art / Animation: Gorgeous Gorgeous Gorgeous show. This show is seriously pretty. Honestly, the fights are super cool to watch, and the animation is fluid as hell. The comedy is also shown to be overexaggerated, and the expressions here are great. Many people have described this as Konosuba-like, and I'd definitely agree. You can see the similarities. The OP and ED also have cool animation!Sound/ Music: Not much to say here. The OP and ED are good, especially the ED and I added it to my playlist. The voice acting is okay. There's not much to say, but they all did the job, and I liked that. Some were FAR better than others, and I kind of wish they noticed that because the difference in skill is blatant.Overall, this show is pretty average. It's a good surprise but nothing extremely notable either. The yuri here is obviously bait, with little actual romance, and the action is okay. If you're looking for an easy watch, this is your show, but if you need something a little better, then watch something else.6/10 Unlucky for her, she gets the news from her maid, Vill, that she's actually going to be a commander for the queen and fight, to the death, over and over.

Kinda disappointed in the outcome of this one ngl.Just so this becomes a valid review in Myanimelists repertoire.. and whilst i\'m at it let me spoil some stuff just to tell you how bad some of the writing decisions are here:I mainly want to talk about the MC, Komarin. Komarin is this really cute vampire that has the most powers in a world literally ruled by the...powerful, of which there are many, but there is a twist: her knowledge of her powers are supporessed. She literally thinks she\'s got no powers at all and thus has to go about problems by resorting to peaceful and communicative solutions.To add things on top of that she is also of royal blood and shall govern the nation of the vampires, lead an army batallion to prove her strength and strive towards world domination. With all these obligations what would she do if not shut herself in?Now if that doesn\'t sound like a promising synopsis... There are even more interesting things about Komarin you can learn about in this show. As she was oblivious to her abilities but always has a strong sense of justice she would stand up to injustice in school. One day by defending a victim of bullying, that bully acquires a new target: Komarin. You see, Komarin is actually a traumatied kid. She was bullied and belittled by a girl with magical powers and Komarin wouldn\'t be able to defend herself. She was even beaten to unconsciousness.Another trauma that is a little indirect but what would influence her overall personality quite a bit... is the following. Let me take you back to a statement from before: Her knowledge of her powers is not only unpresent at the moment. She doesn\'t have to ""find"" that knowledge or discover magic. It is ""suppressed"". It is not shown in full detail but her parents literally appear to have hypnotized Komarin into thinking she hated drinking blood as a vampire which, is the trigger to activate her insane magical powers. And everytime she does drink blood by accident, she immediately forgets everything about what happened during her awakened state. She is actually consistently so very casual about transforming that it is still a point of interest to me after the end of the season but anyway i digress.Komarin has the actual untrust of her parents, with her very underpowered self in the high magic society to deal with. Furthermore there are childhood traumas as a burden.Now the show establishes all these things . These are also the most intricate things that are established at all. These are some very potent issues that could be transformed into a story to a very dramatic extent. But well there end the good news for anyone who likes themselves an adult and multilayered story.You see this fantasy world is actually a joke. Everyone is immortal and wars are led for fun. Bullies and meanies and vilains are actually just the most pittiful people from the get go and very little must be done to convince them to be good to each other, which just amounts to not attacking the person in front of you on sight essentially. Also some plot lines are based on the fact that harm was done to these ""vilains"" but then theres many comedic minutes of runtime from start to end where soldiers slaughter each other with the biggest smiles on their faces. Like is there pain in that world now or not?? This show does not choose a road. It\'s always the one of the other.The moment that komarin transforms it is always in a dire situation. Her friends are in shambles, she was sometimes beaten to. She just proceeds to kill her enemies as they did to her comrades. She is less of that cure for a world of violence by speech and friendship that they are aming for by ridding her of her powers, but more of actually just a boulder the story can put in front of a conflict to very crudely end a story arch.Komarins traumas are actually completely unexplored all the way until the end of the first season.What this show does, is establishing many things but not following up on any of it. Overcoming her traumas is a topic that absolutely is avoided by the show. At the start of the season to comedic effect, but you can\'t bring out 12 episodes of a show without every diving into your characters emotional potential. (To be fair they need time to establish some of the things i mentioned but they could just so easily speed up that process. Komarin is not that intricate of a character)Komarin also builds an entourage of girls kinda ""yuri bait""-ingly gushing over her who are such generically animated buffoons. You kinda end up praying that at some point one will make some serious advances on her. Some ACTUAL romance can go long ways for your story and guess what might make your show a little more popular. I know its probably mostly based on a mid LN or manga that relies on these romance bait tropes, but man i can\'t imagine directors animating this with so little creativity that they can\'t add a few things around the story they\'re given.I would\'ve loved to see Komarin bounce off a potential female lover to gain strength and resolve instead of generating it out of this uber rock solid foundation that is her anwavering emotional stability. Which could\'ve so easily been challenged and thrown over, considering the emotional instability she should carry with her.Anyway there must be a reason i watched this show. Maybe it was hope. I think i really liked Komarins character.. and was disappointed by the story surrounding her and the generic bb female characters around her. powerful, of which there are many, but there is a twist: her knowledge of her powers are supporessed. She literally thinks she\'s got no powers at all and thus has to go about problems by resorting to peaceful and communicative solutions.To add things on top of that she is also of royal blood and shall govern the nation of the vampires, lead an army batallion to prove her strength and strive towards world domination.

Let me take you back to a statement from before: Her knowledge of her powers is not only unpresent at the moment. She doesn\'t have to ""find"" that knowledge or discover magic. It is ""suppressed"". It is not shown in full detail but her parents literally appear to have hypnotized Komarin into thinking she hated drinking blood as a vampire which, is the trigger to activate her insane magical powers. And everytime she does drink blood by accident, she immediately forgets everything about what happened during her awakened state. She is actually consistently so very casual about transforming that it is still a point of interest to me after the end of the season but anyway i digress.Komarin has the actual untrust of her parents, with her very underpowered self in the high magic society to deal with. Furthermore there are childhood traumas as a burden.Now the show establishes all these things . These are also the most intricate things that are established at all. These are some very potent issues that could be transformed into a story to a very dramatic extent. But well there end the good news for anyone who likes themselves an adult and multilayered story.You see this fantasy world is actually a joke. Everyone is immortal and wars are led for fun. Bullies and meanies and vilains are actually just the most pittiful people from the get go and very little must be done to convince them to be good to each other, which just amounts to not attacking the person in front of you on sight essentially. Also some plot lines are based on the fact that harm was done to these ""vilains"" but then theres many comedic minutes of runtime from start to end where soldiers slaughter each other with the biggest smiles on their faces. Like is there pain in that world now or not?? This show does not choose a road. It\'s always the one of the other.The moment that komarin transforms it is always in a dire situation. Her friends are in shambles, she was sometimes beaten to. She just proceeds to kill her enemies as they did to her comrades. She is less of that cure for a world of violence by speech and friendship that they are aming for by ridding her of her powers, but more of actually just a boulder the story can put in front of a conflict to very crudely end a story arch.Komarins traumas are actually completely unexplored all the way until the end of the first season.What this show does, is establishing many things but not following up on any of it. Overcoming her traumas is a topic that absolutely is avoided by the show. At the start of the season to comedic effect, but you can\'t bring out 12 episodes of a show without every diving into your characters emotional potential. (To be fair they need time to establish some of the things i mentioned but they could just so easily speed up that process. Komarin is not that intricate of a character)Komarin also builds an entourage of girls kinda ""yuri bait""-ingly gushing over her who are such generically animated buffoons. You kinda end up praying that at some point one will make some serious advances on her. Some ACTUAL romance can go long ways for your story and guess what might make your show a little more popular. I know its probably mostly based on a mid LN or manga that relies on these romance bait tropes, but man i can\'t imagine directors animating this with so little creativity that they can\'t add a few things around the story they\'re given.I would\'ve loved to see Komarin bounce off a potential female lover to gain strength and resolve instead of generating it out of this uber rock solid foundation that is her anwavering emotional stability. Which could\'ve so easily been challenged and thrown over, considering the emotional instability she should carry with her.Anyway there must be a reason i watched this show. Maybe it was hope. I think i really liked Komarins character.. and was disappointed by the story surrounding her and the generic bb female characters around her.', 'I decide to watch this anime based on the trailer that looked good, but as you can see my score indicted’s other wise.The anime is centered around our main character komari who gets forced to be the leader of the 7th army.Komari is a character that looks weak and thinks she weak but is really strong when drinking the blood of other vampires,But she doesn’t really like drinking blood,so her power up only happens when someone drips blood into her mouth or if it’s the only way.The problem I have with her power is that they never explain it,Oh here’s a random girl giving her...blood,then wow she’s the strongest vampire who’s can solve everything with easily.Since they don’t explain what power she get form the person,you have to figured out on your own form what they show you.Also their are now stakes in the show,because even if you die you just respawn back,so their no Point in worrying if a character dies,because they will came back just fine after a few mins or hours.Villains:One other thing I hated about the show were the dumb villains who take to long to do anything and just let the mc power up and beat them easily.The only decent villain was a bully girl who come form the same school as the mc,and wanted revenge for the Mc killing her 3 years ago.The bully girl easily beats the strongest people in komari squad and kidnaps komari maid.But whipped f*uk do the Mc easily takes care of the bully girl after drinking some of the her miss blood,so long story short the bully girl goes to jail and eats it breaks out,so I don’t f*uk know what’s the point of the god dam jailIn conclusion I *f**k hate the useless piece of garbage Mc that can’t do anything other. Then being strong for a few mins and forgetting about everything she did after drink blood.Worse show I ever watch in my lifeTrash/10 blood,then wow she’s the strongest vampire who’s can solve everything with easily.Since they don’t explain what power she get form the person,you have to figured out on your own form what they show you.Also their are now stakes in the show,because even if you die you just respawn back,so their no Point in worrying if a character dies,because they will came back just fine after a few mins or hours.Villains:One other thing I hated about the show were the dumb villains who take to long to do anything and just let the mc power up and beat them easily.The only decent villain was a bully girl who come form the same school as the mc,and wanted revenge for the Mc killing her 3 years ago.The bully girl easily beats the strongest people in komari squad and kidnaps komari maid.But whipped f*uk do the Mc easily takes care of the bully girl after drinking some of the her miss blood,so long story short the bully girl goes to jail and eats it breaks out,so I don’t f*uk know what’s the point of the god dam jailIn conclusion I *f**k hate the useless piece of garbage Mc that can’t do anything other.

It is not an exaggerated claim to suggest everything was made up as it was going along. There is one clearly defined narrative promise made and kept to the viewer: the protagonist is the stuff...that will change the world. Every narrative plot development and advancement simply comes out of left field, not a lot of groundwork being laid to introduce new developments as they occur, and this only worsens towards the end of the anime. It is immediately apparent in the last 3 episodes specifically. The pacing is poor.The tonality of the show has a very broad range and, as the scope of the full narrative becomes apparent, a lot of that range and the alleged stakes introduced to the cast of characters along the way seems marginalized by the way the story was written. This was a point that was hard to get a bead on, as the anime is surprisingly adept at building up drama and tension at certain points. It is the underwhelming resolutions that follow that put a nail in the proverbial coffin of why a particular moment of adversity was important in the first place.The characters are inoffensive, some of them even being likable and reasonably written. There is enough nuance that every character feels important until they suddenly stop being so and are relegated to being a background character that makes some kind of episodic appearance. Music scoring of the show is good. The animation plays to a wide range--most of the time it is fine, sometimes it is good, a handful of times it is great, and then there are some certainly questionable frames that occur towards the end of the show that invite the question of when exactly budget was running out during production. Thematically, it leans very heavily into being yuri-oriented and dabbles in lite suggestive tones.The show is, in a word, vexing. It did a lot right, but the lacking narrative framework and the poor pacing upend its finer qualities. It is an instance of biting your nose to spite your face. The concept would have been better off picking a lane and sticking to it as far as genre placement is concerned; it is not carefree enough to be an enjoyable slice-of-life, there is not enough in the way of stimuli for it to be a serviceable ecchi anime, it is not particularly funny, sometimes it is more ugly than cute, and narratively it falls completely flat at being anything remarkable as far as a action-drama entry is concerned. It is not bad, but it is not good either.Overall, this is an anime that no-one expected anything from and it delivers just a little bit more than what was expected of it. I cannot recommend it, but I do not believe it is unworthy of being seen by anyone either. If you have the time, watch an episode or 2 and determine for yourself if there is anything it is offering you that may be worth your while. that will change the world.

The answer: Hikikomari Kyuuketsuki no MonmonWe are introduced to the main character: a vampire princess, who is a shut-in, who can't drink blood, and who is an absolute weakling because she can't drink blood. Yet, she has to become a warlord, which is obviously in conflict with her personality. So she'll have to somehow find workarounds, right? Pfft! Amateurs! Just throw in occasional scenes where the character is cuddled in her bed all alone and call that being a shut-in. Who...cares if there isn't a trace of that when she's outside, right? What was that about not being able to drink blood and being weak? It turns out she is so strong that she had been hypnotized not to be able to drink blood, which gives her powers! WHAT A TWIST!That's basically all you need to know about this anime. cares if there isn't a trace of that when she's outside, right? What was that about not being able to drink blood and being weak?

WHAT A TWIST!That's basically all you need to know about this anime."", 'I have to admit, I was probably testing my luck a little with this one.  But to this extent?  Yeah, The Vexations of a Shut-In Vampire Princess wasn\'t the best showing.Story: The Vexations of a Shut-In Vampire Princess introduces us to Terakomari (Komari) Gandeblood, vampire princess who was basically given the throne to her country, evening though her mother knew her tendencies.  One of those tendencies is to shut her self away - hence ""Shut-In Vampire Princess"" so that she can do away with any of her royal responsibilities.  Her supreme commander assigns her a maid, Villhaze, to try and get...Komari to cooperate, but there\'s so much resistance each and every time.  A lot of those responsibilities come down to keeping a good reputation and showing their prowess on the battle field, and unfortunately, a lot of the story just doesn\'t come off as exciting.  There\'s just not enough there.Let\'s start out with what was strong first.  One of the early arcs includes an old time rival, Millicent, and I actually enjoyed the story throughout this arc.  The basic idea is that Komari has a bit of a history with this particular vampire because of how she was treated by her.  Millicent\'s story arc revolves a lot around trying to get back at Komari, and she\'s dead serious about it too.  It\'s believable, and she puts real obstacles in the way of Komari.  It\'s really well done, and even does a good job at revealing Komari\'s true powers, otherwise known as her Core Implosion.  There\'s some good setup there for future arcs and the final episode of that arc is what got me excited for the rest of the season.Sadly, it doesn\'t follow up in any real way.  The story starts us our with Komari introducing herself to her army, and they\'re insanely unlikable, outside of Belius, who I actually really liked.  They constantly make a mockery of themselves and you can easily tell that they\'re going to get involved in the plot, even if you don\'t like it.  After the conclusion of the Millicent arc, there\'s a lot of needless running around for the rest of the season, and even if they attempt to make you care about the characters along the way, their backstories kind of just mold into one because they\'re so similar.  Meet new person, gain they affection with very little effort, make your maid jealous, and then go back to being useless while these new ""allies"" protect you.One of the themes discussed constantly in this series is World Domination, and for such a serious topic, you\'d think there\'d be some serious backstories about how you\'re going to obtain this.  There is... sort of.  It all feels really rushed and doesn\'t really get aided by the fact that Komari\'s kind of useless.  This series is likely suppose to be a comedy series, but it was never really funny, and even then, seems like a weird genre to include in a series that has as much (lackluster) fighting like it does.  It doesn\'t mesh, even with the somewhat cartoony look that it gives its characters sometimes.  Not only that, but since we\'re dealing with vampires here, they don\'t really die.  It really cheapens the effect that ""death"" has.Getting to the end unfortunately is a bit of a chore, just because of how much the plot tries to overstay its welcome.  It\'s all about trying to give power to one country, but it ultimately feels rushed in the end.  Add to the fact that they kept introducing way too many characters along the way, this series tries way too hard to impress on a macro level, when the smaller scale encounters weren\'t even good to begin with.  (5/10)Characters: Komari is really an unlikable character, even if she has brief moments in times when she can actually act like a decent person.  Her core implosion might be her most interesting part of her, but she uses it thrice in the whole series.  It\'s not even that it\'s an impressive ability, but she gets super serious when she uses it too - why was this part of her ability?  The fact that she ""forgets"" what goes on while using it also does the story no favours.  Villhaze is better... but not by much.  She\'s very dedicated to her master, which is fine, but outside of being jealous a lot, she doesn\'t really stick out for any reason.  She\'s just... there.  It\'s obvious what she\'s trying to do, but doesn\'t very little on try and accelerate it.Sakuna, Nelia, Karla and to a lesser extent, Delphine, all kind of mesh together as being similar characters because they don\'t do a ton to impress during the course of the season.  They all got a bunch of screen time and did basically nothing with it.  Sakuna specifically was around the series a lot and even if her arc concluded in a nicer way, where did it leave her?  I\'m not even sure.  Now she just kind of clings to Komari for affection.  I really don\'t understand it.Karen Helvetius is Komari\'s supreme commander and even though she\'s pretty smart, she doesn\'t really do anything worth noting in terms of physical actions.  I\'m trying to remember if she does anything but talk, despite the fact that she got a bunch of screen time.  She basically acts as Komari\'s guardian by telling her what to do and how to do it - as well as talking to her allies about Komari - but that feels like her only purpose here.One of the problems, as mentioned earlier, is that this series adds way too many characters as a rate that really isn\'t necessary.  This series was already having issues with giving our characters a role to begin with, but adding so many from the world building that this series attempts to do is just way too much.  (4/10)Art: So this is one of Project No.9\'s lesser projects, right?  This series had minor moments where it looked fine - mostly in the three Komari fights - but aside that, it looks pretty boring.  It didn\'t do anything to make the more ""down"" moments look bad, but that hardly feels like a compliment to a studio of this size.  (6/10)Sound: Nothing terribly to impress or disappoint here, which might be the highpoint.  I swore off fripSide ages ago because I always felt like their music all sounded the same, but the OP, Red Liberation, was legitimately good.  So there\'s something.  Voice talent seemed fine too.  (6/10)Overall: The Vexations of a Shut-In Vampire Princess was boring and bland with not a lot going for it, outside of the Millicent arc.  It clearly ""can"" have okay story moments if you take your time and focus on a smaller-scale story like hers, but after that, it feels like the story falls apart, especially with a character as boring as Komari.  She doesn\'t do anything to amaze and it makes this series really difficult to recommend.  (5/10) Komari to cooperate, but there\'s so much resistance each and every time.

I can\'t imagine anyone would enjoy that excessive segment rather than a pure sadist.Then once you finally get past that it\'s an exercise in frustration just waiting for the MC to get blood to actually be worth a damn, which wouldn\'t...even be an issue if literally anyone bothered to tell her instead of it having to be a mysterious accident every time.

He's new to this simulation game so he's like a total novice in case of gaming. But with time he gets to understand certain functions but his main aim remains same that is sharpening his skills as a Martial Artist Teacher.OST - Imma give...5/10... 5 because sometimes ost is beautiful and maximum time it's average.Characters - For MC till now it's still 8/10.. 2 points deducted coz, he's too stiff, although I like characters like him, but a Lil flexibility would be great. And yes, 1 point still in my hand coz, it's not completed yet.Other characters. The only one I see worth mentioning is the White haired Guy from the Moonlight Guild. Well, ofcourse because he's a nice leader, but also because, After the MC entered into the picture he is like less spoilt reach young master and more human being who enjoys his youth with his friends.I'll add more if I see any other characters with good character sketches ✨Skip it if u don't want to be spoilt!!!! Spoilers Alert!!There's a White Haired Guild leader Healer Mage, whom the MC calls beautiful at first sight, so probably there's a hint of BL? Or bromance since the white haired kinda seems like his interest only peaks when it's involved MC, but he's a badass Mage too.There are Girls, and maybe some may like the MC too, but from what I've seen, the MC is not really interested in any of them, nonetheless he's really a gentleman to them.There's this guy called Coward? Since I watch it with English subs 😅, so he's like a dedicated student of MC who is really genuine about learning Martial arts from him.And the Antagonist, oof! I really sometimes feel irritated because of him, because he's just a game developer, and according to him MC is like a bug, because he's not following his aligned functions as a gamer😑...and yes, his avatar in the game was helped by MC at first, and the MC really holds no ill will rather he trust this game developer as in avatar form. Also the Actual Boss also doesn't have any problem with the MC but this developer guy is really annoying.It's evident from the opening song that He's like a MC who would supersede the rules of the game and make a name for himself and his beloved Martial arts.!!Spoilers end!!If you think it's BL, it's not, I just said it's giving such vibes, but Anygays, it's really an AWSTASTIC Action Donghua that I always wait for a week to watch each episode ✨Thank you for reading 😊❤️ 5/10... 5 because sometimes ost is beautiful and maximum time it's average.Characters - For MC till now it's still 8/10.. 2 points deducted coz, he's too stiff, although I like characters like him, but a Lil flexibility would be great.

We\'ll see if Tosaki\'s past with his fiancee will get a screen flashback too.', ""These OVAs aren't at /all/ necessary save for the last one, but they're a good watch honestly. The animation is still sub-par, but the story-telling and characterization is tighter and stronger thanks to the runtime.[Story - 7]3 stories are covered in each OVA: an incident set before the show, a series of comedic vignettes from multiple POV's, and (parts of) Sato's backstory.I particularly enjoyed the first one, as it had the 'horror' vibe I was told that this show had in spades, yet did not quite deliver on. It felt genuinely more intense and tragic than what happened in the show thanks to the more...typical 'whiny teen' protagonist, which was fine for this one-off.The second one was really goofy, but honestly? I LOVED it! It's nice to finally see all these (mostly) super-serious characters in comedic scenarios. Izumi and Tosaki's in particular was my favourite, as these are probably the two that are the most 'grounded'.The third one was my favourite, though. If you somehow read my reviews of the 2 seasons, you'll have seen me complain about how Sato, despite how awesome he can be, lacks backstory. Well, here we finally get some! It's an interesting bit, as we see how his psychology transforms after participating in the capture of the 'first' Ajin, and even some traces of the Sato in the original show. I wish there was a bit more monologuing from him, but I'll take what I can get.[Art - 4]Artwork is the same quality as the first season (arguably looks even worse at certain moments). I really have nothing else to add here.[Sound - 6]Soundwork was the same as always - the music is lacking in identity but works well, the OP/ED music is stellar, and the SFX + voice-acting is fairly competent. I particularly love the voice-acting in the first one, as the desperation + justified angst of the protagonist truly comes through.[Character - 7]Characterization is considerably tighter here, thanks again to the reduced run-time. In the first OVA, it's all believably written and conveyed - there's no 'true' character arc, but you /do/ get invested in these characters for the 20-or-so minutes you watch them.The second OVA is comedic, so it's just taking what was established in the show and applying it to skits. Nothing really different or new here.The third OVA was pretty cool though - there are only really /2/ characters we focus on (Sato and a military buddy of his), but they receive enough fleshing out to warrant interest. Even though I LOVED how Sato's evolution was portrayed here, his buddy Kemper was written well and I would actually like to see/read more about him in future installments of the animanga just to see how he would react.[Enjoyment/Overall - 6]I don't really have any closing comments to add, as I think the introduction covered it just fine. Same recommendation as for the two seasons: watch if you don't really care about artwork, and just want good plot and characters. typical 'whiny teen' protagonist, which was fine for this one-off.The second one was really goofy, but honestly?

He is actually more realistic and interesting than Nagai is, which is a shame, because this episode is the last we ever see of him. He would have been a far better main character than Nagai.Second episode is worse than the first one. It's first half explains how Sato got to the funds for buying all the weapons he uses. It's a little bit unconvincing since Tanaka is being played like he is a complete moron, which is too much even for someone like him.

The original series was a good example of teenage love triangles. It wasn’t afraid to be melodramatic in its conflict and resolutions. That said, seeing such overblown interactions can be painful and rather annoying to watch for some viewers. And make no mistake, there’s a lot of conflicts like this. Which is why AnoNatsu may not be for everyone. Though these were the elements that pulled me towards liking this show in the first place. Those that watched and...loved the series would be eagerly anticipating this special thanks to that final scene from the original. So, does the AnoNatsu Special create the same feeling of reminiscence and sentiment prevalent in the parent series?The short answer is no.And now for the long answer.One excellent example of an OVA would arguably be the Steins;Gate OVA. It expands from the original plotline and nails a definite conclusion between Okabe and Kurisu’s relationship while at the same time showing off the points that made the original show entertaining. Another one would be Mirai Nikki’s OVA. Whether or not the messed up direction it took towards the final last episodes was appropriate, I can confidently say the OVA offered a very clear sense of closure for the two main characters creating a full circle sort of ending.AnoNatsu’s special started off very well at first. Taking place 2 years after the events of the main series, the show gives a quick snapshot of where the main cast is after those events. Everyone has moved on and repaired their relationships while Kaito occasionally reminisces about the events from that summer. This isn’t a problem in itself. It’s only fair for Kaito to reflect on those events. However, the show does not explore the new relationships he has created the past 2 years except for one scene in a montage showing him in the film club. And this is disappointing. Kaito had been exempt from the heated conflicts of the original series and the OVA did not take the opportunity to explore his character further. In that sense, the Kaito seen in the special may be no different from 2 years ago. That is alarming lack of character development for the main character.Unfortunately, the time that could’ve been given to Kaito’s newfound relationships and past internal struggle are instead wasted on fanservice and jokes that have been rehashed. The entire middle third of the special is a flashback footage which didn’t appear in the original show, yet used the same ‘joke’ (Lemon getting everyone drunk). It’s sloppy writing and shows the writers had no idea how to fill in that gap. There’s no need to spend 8 to 10 minutes showing a flashback footage that Kaito had played. We already know he liked, and still likes, Ichika and in reality it only needs a couple of minutes to reinforce Kaito’s feelings about this to the audience. Instead, the final third of the show is where we see Kaito’s melancholy as he talks with Kanna and by this point in time it’s no longer needed considering the massive exposition we got about Kaito’s nostalgia. It’s odd to think that Mio and Tetsuro gets 50 times more character progression than Kaito did.Maybe the most frustrating thing about this special is the final minutes where it is simply a reiteration of the final moments of the original last episode. A subtle hint or implication that Ichika can come back to Earth. While we now know for certain she comes back to Earth, it was something viewers already knew. It wasn’t new information. It wasn’t surprising. And it was shown in the same way as before! It doesn’t create the heartfelt feeling like in the original ending because we already knew all this. Yes. Personally I am upset there wasn’t a reuniting scene between Kaito and Ichika. But the problem is that viewers already know the ending which means the OVA must be able to display the conclusion in a different way. And a reuniting scene would have been a simple and effective way of doing it. It takes what viewers already know and gives proper closure compared to having it being inferred. And hell, the last few episodes of Kaito and Ichikia going all lovey-dovey was adorable to see, so there’s no reason to not put that in this special!Despite the writers questionable decisions, one thing I like about the OVA was the creative decision to get both the same artists from the original series to do the OP and ED. It sets a familiar tone for the show and reflects on the idea of nostalgia and waiting. I particularly like the ED’s uncanny resemblance to the original ED (Vidro Moyou). A subtle decision which I liked.For those expecting the concrete closure on this teen romance space sci-fi tale you’ll be sorely disappointed. The OVA doesn’t add anything new between the main couple and actually explores more on its side characters. Lazy writing, unnecessary fanservice and reused jokes make the special lackluster and ultimately, not worth watching. loved the series would be eagerly anticipating this special thanks to that final scene from the original.

And hell, the last few episodes of Kaito and Ichikia going all lovey-dovey was adorable to see, so there’s no reason to not put that in this special!Despite the writers questionable decisions, one thing I like about the OVA was the creative decision to get both the same artists from the original series to do the OP and ED. It sets a familiar tone for the show and reflects on the idea of nostalgia and waiting. I particularly like the ED’s uncanny resemblance to the original ED (Vidro Moyou). A subtle decision which I liked.For those expecting the concrete closure on this teen romance space sci-fi tale you’ll be sorely disappointed. The OVA doesn’t add anything new between the main couple and actually explores more on its side characters. Lazy writing, unnecessary fanservice and reused jokes make the special lackluster and ultimately, not worth watching.', ""Ano Natsu special/OVA.All I can say is WARNING: If you've enjoyed the original series don't bother watching this. Only watch this if you like nostalgic moments and want to be reminded of this series.In short the whole episode feels like a love letter to fans who miss the show with some old jokes thrown in. Hence the nostalgia.Full review (SPOILERS INCLUDED):Ano Natsu special/OVA takes place 2 years after the original series. Where we learn that the main characters are already in their final year of high school and graduating soon. Sounds like a great plotline right? Wrong....To begin, Ichika & Lemon-senpai are missing from the episode.Not entirely true. Actually they only make cameo appearances.Lemon rejoined the MIB in episode 12 so it makes sense if she doesn't appear at all in the OVA. But for Ichiko, if you watched the last scene of Episode 12 you notice that in the school festival film Ichika is saying her lines while wearing the jacket Kai's sister bought for her. So that means she did come back to earth shortly sometime after Episode 12 ended because the film was made during the summer and shown immediately at the school festival after summer vacation ended. But here we are shown that Ichiko never came back at all during those 2 years and everyone is still moving on. So what happened? Sadly we never got an answer.Next, instead of discussing how their lives have progressed after the events of Episode 12 (And why Ichika is missing), 8 mins into the OVA Kai decides to watch one of his old film reels and from there we spend the next 10 mins of the 23 mins episode observing the lives of the main cast ONE DAY before they made their movie. So I guess like most animes this OVA is a prequel? (Surprise, surprise)As I've mentioned the old film reel part turns the entire episode from Sequel to Prequel. We see reruns of old jokes like Lemon-senpai tricking everyone into getting drunk and Ishigaki's sister calling her husband an idiot.Soon after the reel ends (And we're left with only 5 mins of screentime), Kai meets up with the rest of the old cast (Ichiko still missing of course) and they hang out like old times. In the final scene we're taken to space where we (finally) see a cameo of Ichiko looking out the spaceship window excitedly (presumably because she is coming back to earth)As I've said its a pure nostalgic episode with no plotpoint at all. Meant to be a love letter to fans so I give it a 6 because whie I am happy to see Ano Natsu again I would prefer if made something more plot significant or didn't make this episode at all.

If not, then this review will be a big spoiler for you.(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (5/10) (SPOILERS)A special episode of ""Waiting in the Summer"" included in the Blu-Ray Box Set. The events of the OVA takes place at their final year of High School.I wish the OVA took place after the events of the main series because this special episode didn\'t really add anything. It\'s just a look back to the events of their summer 2 years ago...with some ""new"" scenes stamped into it. Notice the quotation mark? That\'s right, they\'re not really new. They\'re just fanservice scenes that we have already seen so many times in the original series, scenes showing how they\'ve moved on and some re-hashed jokes. For example, Remon making them drink something that looks like a lemon and later, they would get drunk. Those kind of jokes. While I do agree that the jokes are repetitive, they\'re still somewhat funny. To me, at least.At the last 2 minutes of the episode, we\'re shown that Ichika has been granted access to return back to Earth after M.I.B reversed-engineered a ship that allowed them ""interstellar travelling"", coinciding with the main series\' ending. How disappointing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (9/10)The animation looks exactly the same as the main series. Same visuals, same animation, same character designs. In other words, it didn\'t really change and it didn\'t need to change.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (10/10)The soundtrack....Simply outstanding. The OP theme song is ""Kisetsu no Shutter"" by Ray and the ED theme song is ""point at infinity"" by Nagi Yanagi. The OP theme song is just beautiful. At the time I\'m writing this review, I can\'t stop listening to the OP song and I need someone to stop me. The singer\'s voice and the song is just awesome. The ED theme song also sounds great.All of the character\'s VA reprises their role so no VA replacement for the current main characters. Oh, thank god.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (6/10)Since the OVA takes place right before Ichika has been granted access to return to ""Earth"", only the 5 main characters makes an appearance and Ichika appearing at the ending. There were a couple of side characters who makes an appearance like Kaito\'s older sister and Tetsurou\'s older sister.Since you already know the characters, I can\'t really say anything that much else about the characters. Except we\'re shown that Tetsurou and Mio are now dating, Kanna moved on over her love for Kaito, Remon is still with the M.I.B and the reasons are still unknown as to how she managed to join the agency in the first place and Kaito living his life without Ichika. They\'re all back to normal and happily ever after. Kaito\'s older sister and Tetsurou\'s older sister is still the same old, same old.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (6/10)I did enjoy the special episode.....a little bit. Mostly because of the scene where they ""accidentally"" get drunk. Ahh, it never gets old.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (5.4/10)""Waiting in the Summer: Special"" is a decent OVA but you don\'t have to watch it unless you really want to know more about the character\'s life after the main series.

Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37338/Chuukan_Kanriroku_Tonegawa,"['Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa is a non-canon spin-off series to Kaiji. Written not by the master himself, but by two of his die hard fans. The series focuses around a man named Tonegawa, who was introduced in the first anime season.From its settings, CKT is the polar opposite of Fukumoto Nobuyuki\'s (the author of Kaiji) gambling series for the reason that the main lead is not a person taking part in the gambling games, but instead working for the man who is behind these events. For that matter, recognizing this series to be even part of the same universe with Kaiji would be impossible if...it wasn\'t for Madhouse giving it an anime adaptation with identical production values and characters as in Kaiji. Similar ideas have been executed with great success in the past, such as Full Metal Panic Fumoffu which was also the 3rd season to FMP franchise, and the polar opposite of its first 2 seasons.Despite the vastly different setup, the biggest difference between CKT and Kaiji lies within the series\' approach. There where Kaiji was a game - thriller from its genres, CKT is a slice of life comedy series. Those who expected this to be anything like Kaiji are now disappointed, which somewhat can explain the low mean score the series currently has. Personally, I have the ability to appreciate series for more than one reason, and have been laughing my butt sore with CKT.The comedy is badass and manly beyond belief, and focuses around the challenges Tonegawa meets in his daily job. This one time, bunch of people loaned money from the wrong folks, more specifically, from Tonegawa\'s boss. This is okay, of course, but now it\'s time to pay back, bitches! Tonegawa and his lackeys want to get their money and there is no escaping the manliness. They are literally everywhere and own everything in Japan, apparently. They go to your work, random car backseats, any alley in Chinatown. Just name it and they are there, and oh, you will pay no matter how small the sum you owe, is.This other time, Tonekawa got mad at another dude for having too complicated of a last name (which he later forgot). How anyone can even write comedy like this is beyond me. ""Apologize to me for having such a complex name."" Arrogance like this tends to create good comedy moments, and here they truly shine. Most of our scenes are similarly amazing, and will appeal to manly men, such as myself, unconditionally. It\'s no secret that people with less money have no value in the eyes of society and CKT promotes this shamelessly with scenes such as these.The characters are one of our selling points, and the main reason why the comedy works so well. The president dude (Tonegawa\'s boss), is a real philosopher. Lays on bed made of his employees (yes, you read correctly), telling how humans are being fed with money like animals with food. Apparently, the biggest mistake citizens make is think of society as their mother. Our manly men are here to show what real men are about.. by taking everything these pathetic people in debt own and making their life miserable while making sure that they understand how this is, indeed, their own fault for not understanding how money works. I must admit I love it when dudes who never understood what dollar is worth, get what is coming. The comedy is beyond great. It always treats trash people like the trash they are. I appreciate dudes like these when it comes to comedic content.This series will most likely not appeal all that well to extremely sympathetic people, or those who forget that this is all just comedy centering around very brutal and illegal gambling business... or are also very poor and in debt themselves.. or further have yet to acknowledge that this is how the world works, like it or not.The narrator is also a highly visible character, and an epic one for that matter. Whenever he says anything, it\'s like UFC fighter introductions in Japanese, except he does it with every word no matter the subject and how anti-climatic the event he describes, is. I also die of laughter when ever he introduces Tonekawa Yukio and pronounces his name ""yu-gi-oh"".The production is practically identical to the Kaiji anime series from 10 years ago. Same, cute, moe art style and character design. Manly, badass voices for dudeouses, and awe-inspiring sound effects when anything dramatic happens. Madhouse has done great many questionable choices in the recent years, but this is not one of them.As a person who enjoys manly and bro stuff, and liked both Kaiji seasons, as well as most of the manga series by the original creator, there is no reason for me to not love this show. The comedy is superb and all the dudes are awesome.

Well of fucking course it has zawa.zawa zawa', ""Donning his drab trench coat with a pack of cigarettes in tow is a man constantly at odds. He hunts those who dare test his patience, often poor strays lying about already bleeding for cash. In his eyes the pleas of worthless trash that caused their own misery, a contrast to the hardworking man standing in front of them. All they could give weighing less than a single bill of currency. He writes in his notebook: “Money matters are life and death matters. Society isn’t your mother.” Words he holds true to heart, using them to push himself further. As in the shadow of glory...and legends lies one Yukio Tonegawa, a mere middle manager, suffering and fighting in ways that no one really knows.Mr. Tonegawa – Middle Management Blues is a peculiar spin-off to the underground classic gambling thriller Kaiji: The Ultimate Survivor in that it is set initially prior to the parent story and follows one of the minor antagonists to the main series. Tonegawa serves as the financial consulting firm Teiai Group’s second in charge and the right-hand man to president Hyoudou Kazutaka, who has a disconcerting fondness for extreme forms of entertainment. The series largely focuses to Tonegawa to meet and satisfy whatever Hyoudou wishes at practically any given time and has been assigned a project team to assist him, pitting Tonegawa in a predicament where he needs to appeal to both parties in order to succeed in his role. Through this premise, Tonegawa is able to bring out laughter from even the darkest of places.The most important thing to understand about this series is that this is not the suspenseful thrill ride that Kaiji was, instead it seeks to act as a comedy and parody to the Kaiji series. In theory this places the show as a near complete polar opposite to its predecessor and what its intentions were, however this spin-off comes across more as a worthy companion piece to the series as a whole. While villains such as Tonegawa and Hyoudou still remain morally bad and even sinister at times, this new perspective expands upon their ideals and motives, even showing weaknesses in their struggles with life, particularly on Tonegawa’s inability to connect with each of his subordinates. Speaking of, characters that were no more than faceless thugs before are given a breath of fresh air with a more humanistic characterization to each of the men in black working under Tonegawa’s lead. A greater understanding of these characters coupled with a more grounded tone provides viewers with numerous moments tacked on throughout the show’s runtime that can easily be thought of as relatable and oddly endearing. It easily captures authentic parts of life at work and portrays it in a comedic way that might even be more effective for those of us who have already experienced moments like these ourselves. This expansion of the story may not have been needed, but it is surely welcomed for a fan like myself considering what it brings to the table.Often when criticisms about the show’s use of humour are brought up, while I can respect the differing points of view I feel they ultimately miss the mark for how and why comedy works for Tonegawa. There are several different styles of comedy and even at the time when comedy anime has experienced a kind of resurgence, observational and surreal humour is still rare to find. And this is what I believe really helps make Tonegawa stand apart from its contemporaries; it’s a comedy series that thrives on these comedic styles through exaggerating the importance of seemingly mundane and trivial aspects, partnered with a keen eye for detail leading to preposterous leaps of logic. The character Tonegawa is a perfect match for this type of humour, having been a key antagonist in the original series heavily reliant on observation already. The first meeting with the men in black provides a clear example of this: they all look the same and he says upfront that he cannot tell them apart from one another, and when he tries learning their names he picks up on whatever slight similarities exist between them, making it even more difficult for a character like Tonegawa to differentiate between his henchmen. It's an absurd line of logic that is actually executed quite well. Psychological, yet surprisingly relatable events like this are what give the series its own distinct charm. The show also has its fair share of subtle humour placed throughout each episode that help make episodes more memorable in their own way.Trying to picture how this style of comedy could possibly work so effectively may prove difficult to those of you who have yet to watch anything from the franchise, and this leads into another core element of the show: the presentation. The entire franchise does utilize a very atypical art style that can easily act as a deterrent to potential fans, but further helps set the series as a whole apart from every other anime today. What’s more important however are the visual metaphors utilized, borrowing the techniques from the main source material originally used to make scenes more enthralling and using them in parody-style fashion, now creating low-brow jokes to act as literal metaphors and visual representations of such. Some of the more memorable examples include Tonegawa calling all his subordinates gutter balls after finding they are all interested in bowling coupled with every man in black rolling a gutter ball and Tonegawa hanging on to what appears to be a spider’s thread until soon after is revealed to be drool from the president after he failed Hyoudou. There’s also numerous references made to past works by the original creator of Kaiji that are sure to catch the eyes of seasoned fans for those series’. Major props to Jay Kabira who voiced the narrator of Tonegawa and might have been the best part of the series; his ability to garner genuine hype to even the most monotonous of things is second to none and was splendid to witness. Even the beloved “ZAWA” symbols from Kaiji are able to produce an oddly surreal atmosphere that I’ve never seen before in anime.Sadly, it cannot all be high praise as Tonegawa does run into some issues along the way. The show teases progression a lot in regard to the relationship between Tonegawa and his employees. The show is certainly episodic but never tries to capitalize with all the sincere moments it creates like it potentially could have. Apart from being partially directionless, the story introduces short stories from the perspective of another antagonist from the original series, Tarou Ootsuki that in my opinion worked as a nice change of pace for a while, until half of every episode was dedicated to him. Tonegawa’s struggles brought forth what I felt was a much greater sense of absurdism and creativity that could carry the show compared to Ootsuki. It’s also perplexin why they would continue with content for Ootsuki considering an anime specifically focused on this character was announced halfway through this series… I don’t really know what to say to that, but honestly it just feels like they wasted TV time that could’ve been spent better.The production, while emulating a similar style to that of Kaiji also unfortunately lacks the attention to detail in character designs and much of any fluid animation. Not a big issue for a comedy series in my opinion but these features were certainly noticeable. The colour palette used was much more faded and less vibrant in contrast and while I would not call it poor quality, feels a lot cheaper by comparison. Studio Madhouse were behind this series with a different staff, yet still manages to provide us with a successful homage to its parent anime visually. The music is also fairly unmemorable which is a shame as it remains one of the best features from both seasons of Kaiji. But the voice acting was solid from the main cast and the opening, “Sassou to Hashiru Tonegawa-kun” by Gesu no Kiwami Otome, became one of the most enjoyable and upbeat themes to hear an anime begin with. Hell, here’s the URL, you can thank me later: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkbyJ3unvWQMr. Tonegawa – Middle Management Blues is a series that at first glance may appear to not know what audience to appeal to; the new or old. But I implore you, especially if you have seen Kaiji to try this spin-off. It is not Kaiji, nor was it seriously trying to be, but what you will find is hopefully one of the most entertaining and downright distinct comedies in a year almost saturated with them, and from my viewpoint the most underrated anime of the year. Zawa Zawa. and legends lies one Yukio Tonegawa, a mere middle manager, suffering and fighting in ways that no one really knows.Mr. Tonegawa – Middle Management Blues is a peculiar spin-off to the underground classic gambling thriller Kaiji: The Ultimate Survivor in that it is set initially prior to the parent story and follows one of the minor antagonists to the main series. Tonegawa serves as the financial consulting firm Teiai Group’s second in charge and the right-hand man to president Hyoudou Kazutaka, who has a disconcerting fondness for extreme forms of entertainment. The series largely focuses to Tonegawa to meet and satisfy whatever Hyoudou wishes at practically any given time and has been assigned a project team to assist him, pitting Tonegawa in a predicament where he needs to appeal to both parties in order to succeed in his role. Through this premise, Tonegawa is able to bring out laughter from even the darkest of places.The most important thing to understand about this series is that this is not the suspenseful thrill ride that Kaiji was, instead it seeks to act as a comedy and parody to the Kaiji series. In theory this places the show as a near complete polar opposite to its predecessor and what its intentions were, however this spin-off comes across more as a worthy companion piece to the series as a whole. While villains such as Tonegawa and Hyoudou still remain morally bad and even sinister at times, this new perspective expands upon their ideals and motives, even showing weaknesses in their struggles with life, particularly on Tonegawa’s inability to connect with each of his subordinates. Speaking of, characters that were no more than faceless thugs before are given a breath of fresh air with a more humanistic characterization to each of the men in black working under Tonegawa’s lead. A greater understanding of these characters coupled with a more grounded tone provides viewers with numerous moments tacked on throughout the show’s runtime that can easily be thought of as relatable and oddly endearing. It easily captures authentic parts of life at work and portrays it in a comedic way that might even be more effective for those of us who have already experienced moments like these ourselves. This expansion of the story may not have been needed, but it is surely welcomed for a fan like myself considering what it brings to the table.Often when criticisms about the show’s use of humour are brought up, while I can respect the differing points of view I feel they ultimately miss the mark for how and why comedy works for Tonegawa. There are several different styles of comedy and even at the time when comedy anime has experienced a kind of resurgence, observational and surreal humour is still rare to find. And this is what I believe really helps make Tonegawa stand apart from its contemporaries; it’s a comedy series that thrives on these comedic styles through exaggerating the importance of seemingly mundane and trivial aspects, partnered with a keen eye for detail leading to preposterous leaps of logic. The character Tonegawa is a perfect match for this type of humour, having been a key antagonist in the original series heavily reliant on observation already. The first meeting with the men in black provides a clear example of this: they all look the same and he says upfront that he cannot tell them apart from one another, and when he tries learning their names he picks up on whatever slight similarities exist between them, making it even more difficult for a character like Tonegawa to differentiate between his henchmen. It's an absurd line of logic that is actually executed quite well. Psychological, yet surprisingly relatable events like this are what give the series its own distinct charm. The show also has its fair share of subtle humour placed throughout each episode that help make episodes more memorable in their own way.Trying to picture how this style of comedy could possibly work so effectively may prove difficult to those of you who have yet to watch anything from the franchise, and this leads into another core element of the show: the presentation. The entire franchise does utilize a very atypical art style that can easily act as a deterrent to potential fans, but further helps set the series as a whole apart from every other anime today. What’s more important however are the visual metaphors utilized, borrowing the techniques from the main source material originally used to make scenes more enthralling and using them in parody-style fashion, now creating low-brow jokes to act as literal metaphors and visual representations of such. Some of the more memorable examples include Tonegawa calling all his subordinates gutter balls after finding they are all interested in bowling coupled with every man in black rolling a gutter ball and Tonegawa hanging on to what appears to be a spider’s thread until soon after is revealed to be drool from the president after he failed Hyoudou. There’s also numerous references made to past works by the original creator of Kaiji that are sure to catch the eyes of seasoned fans for those series’. Major props to Jay Kabira who voiced the narrator of Tonegawa and might have been the best part of the series; his ability to garner genuine hype to even the most monotonous of things is second to none and was splendid to witness. Even the beloved “ZAWA” symbols from Kaiji are able to produce an oddly surreal atmosphere that I’ve never seen before in anime.Sadly, it cannot all be high praise as Tonegawa does run into some issues along the way. The show teases progression a lot in regard to the relationship between Tonegawa and his employees. The show is certainly episodic but never tries to capitalize with all the sincere moments it creates like it potentially could have. Apart from being partially directionless, the story introduces short stories from the perspective of another antagonist from the original series, Tarou Ootsuki that in my opinion worked as a nice change of pace for a while, until half of every episode was dedicated to him. Tonegawa’s struggles brought forth what I felt was a much greater sense of absurdism and creativity that could carry the show compared to Ootsuki. It’s also perplexin why they would continue with content for Ootsuki considering an anime specifically focused on this character was announced halfway through this series… I don’t really know what to say to that, but honestly it just feels like they wasted TV time that could’ve been spent better.The production, while emulating a similar style to that of Kaiji also unfortunately lacks the attention to detail in character designs and much of any fluid animation. Not a big issue for a comedy series in my opinion but these features were certainly noticeable. The colour palette used was much more faded and less vibrant in contrast and while I would not call it poor quality, feels a lot cheaper by comparison. Studio Madhouse were behind this series with a different staff, yet still manages to provide us with a successful homage to its parent anime visually. The music is also fairly unmemorable which is a shame as it remains one of the best features from both seasons of Kaiji. But the voice acting was solid from the main cast and the opening, “Sassou to Hashiru Tonegawa-kun” by Gesu no Kiwami Otome, became one of the most enjoyable and upbeat themes to hear an anime begin with.

Instead, this series focuses on the No. 2 person of the black market group that is Teiai Corporation and the right-hand man of nefarious President Kazutaka Hyoudou: Tonegawa Yukio, Middle Manager (or middleman) between President Hyoudou and the men in black that\'s introduced and is present in both seasons of Kaiji. Technically a spin-off non-canon series if you will.Made as a manga by Tensei Hagiwara (literally a die-hard fan of the original series), which includes both this series and 1-nichi Gaishutsuroku Hanchōu which features Team E\'s famous underground foreman Ootsuki, the premise of Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa is set-up very differently from how Kaiji was from the get-go: a comedic parody of the day-to-day events at Teiai Corporation, featuring both Tonegawa and his project team of mercenary MIB in all sorts of weird antics despite the age gap in his group. Unlike Kaiji though, the series of events of Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa isn\'t quite set-up the way that it is at random, but is linear to how Kaiji started and its gradual flow, which it incorporates a similar style and its origins (since time is turned back towards the pre-Kaiji days). So, with this series, don\'t expect too much, but just encounter Fukumoto-sensei\'s well-known Zawa...Zawa… trademark, lots of endless comedies between the Prez, Tonegawa himself and his team of management blues, regarding and taking responsibility for whatever actions that are dealt with, and vice versa. Not to mention, Foreman Ootsuki\'s involvement with his other labour staff and his one-day outing excursions which feel very off, but with the joining of hands between Tonegawa and Ootsuki, it once again feels very natural in sight.The acclaimed series was done by Madhouse 10 years prior in 2008, so it wouldn\'t be a surprise that even though Madhouse is once again back to animate this project, albeit with a different production staff this time and not the original team, it wouldn\'t necessarily cause justification or a rationale of the ""pointing fingers Blame Game"". But instead, it still manages to showcase some of the fine details that is an omage to the Kaiji series, and for that, I think this is a win. For the most part, Madhouse manages to peak out at a good angle of watch-ability, and even if some parts are not great, the series as a whole looks pleasing to the eye, and is really a treat to watch some of the finest non-Kaiji stuff.The music is unfortunately the low point of the series (to just about many), but I actually found it good to begin with. Gesu no Kiwami Otome\'s OP which explains and sing praises about Tonegawa\'s standout traits is the perfect song to go with it. The moment when I heard the song and realized that the entire song is just 2 minutes short (that actually fits within excellent narrations done by sportscaster Jay Kabira), I couldn\'t believe my ears! It was just SO SO perfect and well done; the duration makes sense for Jay Kabira\'s introduction of Tonegawa (for front instrumentals) and the ever constant ""chisana, chisanaaaa, monogatari de aru"", that\'s when I know, it\'s a damn great song that thankfully lasted throughout the entire series. We got 2 EDs this time, the OK-ish 1st half by Pistol Takehara and the impressive up-beat and uplifting 2nd half by NoisyCell. Regardless of choices, I found the music to be the detractor for many people here.In all sense of the word, Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa was a very fun, well-deserved watch, and the privilege is that you don\'t need to be a Kaiji fan to watch this funny spin-off.

However, that excitment slowly faded away as soon as I started watching this series.This Kaiji spin off is shit. It’s basically a pointless story with exaggerated, forced comedy on boring, trivial scenes and trying to make them funny. It repeats the same joke for too long sometimes, e.g. remembering the men in black’s name dragged on for 3 episodes. Comedy is subjective, but I find it hard to believe anyone finds this type of humor funny. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever laughed once while watching...this show.Tonegawa is supposed to be this cool, competent, strategic right-hand man, but in this show he’s reduced to a bumbling insecure man that stresses over remembering some men in black’s names. The president is supposed to be this intimidating, wise old man. Here he’s a old coot with mood swings. The show butchered their characterisation and the way I view them all for the sake of comedy.The men in black are bland, one dimensional characters and I don’t care if it’s  intentional.The narrator’s voice is so annoying and tries so hard to be funny it ends up having the opposite effect. The osts aren’t helping, the “zawa zawa~” doesn’t fit the tone of this show and just builds false suspense.I can’t fathom why there’s so many positive reviews on this garbage.If you’re a fan of Kaiji, I’d recommend steering clear from this because it fails to capture what makes Kaiji so great and it’s not even about gambling to begin with. this show.Tonegawa is supposed to be this cool, competent, strategic right-hand man, but in this show he’s reduced to a bumbling insecure man that stresses over remembering some men in black’s names.

It succeeds where many don't, keeps us continuously engaged with fresh humour and day-to-day lives of TEAI member lives and most importantly Tonegawa. This review will contain minor spoilers. You have been warned.Story - 8The story is very simple and works as a prequel to Kaiji (even though it isn't canon, but this reviewer sees it as canon). It's set several months before the battle on the ship of hope, Espoir. Tonegawa is tasked with assembling a diabolical game and he endeavors to do that with his team.The shenanigans that result from that point on are incredible....From Tonegawa trying to discern who is who in his team, to some genuine life lessons (what is flash mob, what is a pyramid scheme, how to manage a team and so) Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa manages it all.At some times it switches to the life of Foreman Ootsuki and further world builds the underground of the Kaiji universe, but the episodes feel weaker than Tonegawa's.Nonetheless it is very enjoyable.Art - 7Kaiji's art was never the thing I fawned much about. It was neither great nor horrible to me, just enjoyable. It adds uniqueness to the world and it faithfully stays true to the artstyle. The physical metaphors are as always, amazing.Sound - 8The opening song is just plain amazing. It is so simple and catching and makes this reviewer dance along. It mashes really well with the general tone of the story and the particular circumstance in which music is used.Character - 9To me these were the absolute stars of the show. Tonegaw, Ootsuki, the men in black, even Hyoudo and some other side characters are really nicely developed. They stay in character (I see you men in black with your glasses), their personalities are all pleasant and realistic, but the star of the stars is, and always will be, Tonegawa. He is simply amazing. I came from Kaiji hating his guts and this show made me LOVE the character. The only mishap to me was Seijo (the casino owner) who got on my nerves too much and the woman in black. Her plotline with one of the men on the team and lack of screentime made her feel undeveloped and took away some of my enjoyment.Enjoyment - 8Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa is simply put amazing, I love it, I'd watch it any time, the narrator really made me laugh, and the english was also amazing. Would recommend to a friend.For overall rating Chuukan Kanriroku Tonegawa gets a well-deserved 8!

I think there are some valuable lessons to be learned in this anime based on mistakes the employees make and also this anime seems to portray life in Japan a bit more realistically. While some things probably wouldn't happen in Japan,...they definitely have black companies and you can learn a lot about Japanese gambling here in general including keiba ( horse riding ). Since it's aimed towards a Japanese audience, maybe this might be difficult for some people to understand hence the low ratings. I was a bit surprised by them, but then it might be because the jokes are more culture-related.Art - 9This art style reminds me of the 80s but clearly it was based off an old manga. It's pretty good and I think it fits the tone of the story well, which is what the art should be doing. The character designs also seem to serve their purpose well in the anime and you can even easily differentiate different characters which is nice and also important with anime plus the designs are appropriate for the story. The animation is overall pretty well made and the quality of it is great. What I noticed is that the animation for this anime is always consistent and I really like that because some animes don't have a consistent art style like Tonegawa.Sound - 10The most memorable part about Tonegawa would be the sound to me, because I really liked the opening/ending songs (which were catchy and suitable for the story). I was surprised that Gesu no Kiwami Otome would be singing for this anime, I like their songs but not really the band itself due to various scandals the lead singer was involved in (most Japanese people hate this band). Either way the song was pretty good and I like it. Anyways, the voice acting in this anime is probably the one I would never forget because the narrator speaks in memes and they also add in sound effects for that extra meme effect.Character - 8Not much I can say here. They're all good at least but I think some are kinda two-dimensional, either way I still had a lot of characters I liked in the story. Tonegawa is probably my favorite though...Enjoyment/Overall - 9I kinda just combined them since to me, they my enjoyment affects my overall the most. So overall, 9. It's a pretty good anime, hilarious, and I take notes on this from time to time to improve my Japanese. I think I would rewatch it again, and honestly sometimes I replayed the funny parts of this a few times because I can't get over this anime. I just think it's underrated but maybe there are people who disagree with me.

You're brought in with an utterly confusing intro of the present, which probably gets explained later so not gonna count against it for that, but every moment after we get sent back to the beginning of the story is just boring and utterly pathetic.

After the first few episodes, you will slowly start to get attached to Tonegawa and his team with their funny antics and relatable issues they face in the workplace. Despite really wanting Tonegawa to fail while watching the original Kaiji show, in this spinoff you will really start to respect and like Tonegawa with his discipline and kindness for helping and teaching his team members.First off, you definitely have to watch the original show (KaijI) to understand the characters and setting of this show. It\'s also pretty amazing (9/10), so definitely go check that out first....If you have already watched it, then this show is a really fun follow-up to watch. It\'s a change of pace into a slice of life comedy that is worth watching for Kaiji fans. The beginning storyline of the show also explains how Tonegawa and team members planned the design, game mechanics, and setting for the restricted rock paper scissors game which is really interesting to learn about.At some point the show starts introducing a new section with Ōtsuki, who is the underground foreman who ran the chinchiro dice gambling in the original Kaiji show. However, I hated this character for being a deceptive and cheating villain in the original show, and he has no other redeemable qualities in the spinoff show either unlike Tonegawa. As a result, I still feel the same about his character in the spinoff and thought the sections with Ōtsuki were only a 3/10 or 4/10 at best and really just wanted the show to go back to showing Tonegeawa and his team. Thankfully there\'s only 3 or 4 half episodes of Ōtsuki and the rest is still about the hilarious and interesting Tonegawa stories.The first few episode may feel a little weak, but you can trust me when I say that Tonegawa will start to grow on you. He is a funny, respectable, and kind manager who is just trying his best for Teiai. Don\'t take the show too seriously because it is a slice of life about corporate workplaces and just have some fun with it.***Major spoilers for the original show Kaiji below. Go see that first. This isn\'t really relevant or interesting unless you\'ve seen both shows anyways***There is one minor problem, and it\'s that I cannot see the Tonegawa of this show being the same Tonegawa from Kaiji. In Kaiji, Tonegawa ends up killing over 10 debtors in the bridge game. As a reminder, the game was to cross a thin beam between 2 really tall buildings, and the beam was electrified so that you couldn\'t touch it with your hands. After the debtors cross halfway, they become afraid and ask Tonegawa to turn off the electricity so they can forfeit and return to the building. He doesn\'t reply to them and all of them except for Kaiji end up falling and dying as a result. At the end of the game, he states that he turned off the electricity, but there was a delay which is why one of the debtors ended up touching it still got electrified and fell while the rest believed Tonegawa was never going to turn it off in the first place. He basically blatantly lied and cheated to kill the debtors. In the spinoff, Tonegawa is kind to everyone, even to people like Ebitani who ended up being the cause of a pay cut and was what Tonegawa from Kaiji would probably describe as ""scum"" because he was jobless and wasting his time by taking out his anger on the Teiai Group via Twitter. Despite all of these negative attributes, Tonegawa still ends up giving Ebitani advice and a chance to redeem himself by running Teiai group\'s twitter. Contrast this to a guy who just indirectly murders 10+ people without hesitation, and you would probably agree that they are completely different people. My take on this is that they simply made Tonegawa a lot different for the spinoff to make the show enjoyable, and that you can\'t really connect this back to the Kaiji original show. I like this spinoff Tonegawa way more anyways, so in the end I don\'t really care about this issue. If you have already watched it, then this show is a really fun follow-up to watch. It\'s a change of pace into a slice of life comedy that is worth watching for Kaiji fans. The beginning storyline of the show also explains how Tonegawa and team members planned the design, game mechanics, and setting for the restricted rock paper scissors game which is really interesting to learn about.At some point the show starts introducing a new section with Ōtsuki, who is the underground foreman who ran the chinchiro dice gambling in the original Kaiji show. However, I hated this character for being a deceptive and cheating villain in the original show, and he has no other redeemable qualities in the spinoff show either unlike Tonegawa. As a result, I still feel the same about his character in the spinoff and thought the sections with Ōtsuki were only a 3/10 or 4/10 at best and really just wanted the show to go back to showing Tonegeawa and his team.

Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40507/Arifureta_Shokugyou_de_Sekai_Saikyou_2nd_Season,"[""Look, it's sort of trash. It's basically filled with tropes and the harem one is the worst of them. Why then am I giving it high scores? The story is actually pretty decent. The twists and turns between the tropes are not bad. They set Hajime up to save the day and never show him actually making the shit he pulls out of his ring, but I can forgive this because I have read the trash webnovel which does a bit. Enough to deflect criticism at least. But largely not at all.And yes, the harem makes the characterisation of the girls a bit redundant, but...it's still there and again not lesser than many higher rated anime. The soundtrack is really good, it gets you hype for the trash, and you aren't left disappointed by someone swapping the big win for some more characterisation. Because that bit's already taken by jokes about anal. There are no surprise twists here! It's good solid trash. Hajime will absolutely just keep bringing out bigger guns, even if you've never seen him so much as surreptitiously pop to the loo to build them. And despite it being trash they're a lot more imaginative than any Gundam.The world building is pretty good, believable for a story about killing god. it's still there and again not lesser than many higher rated anime.

There are plenty of shows that are better than it when it comes to quality. It is, however, the most Isekai show ever. Everything anyone has ever liked or complained about an Isekai makes its way somehow in the series, which makes this show one of the most insane ones you can ever watch. There is a car-crash feeling about the show, which helps it stand out in the best of ways.There are bunny girls, vampire girls, dragon girls, and mermaids in a single harem. There is magic in the setting...alongside the usual fantasy creatures that one gets in a show such as this, like orcs, elves, and some generic formless monsters. Humans get superpowers, and the main character doesn’t get the best one but makes use of it so that it turns into the best anyway. There are a lot of sexual and inappropriate jokes and tons of cleavage everywhere. Girls throw themselves onto our Hero, and he retains a kind heart even after being tortured for a long time.That is probably not even half the Isekai stuff in the show, but it is all I care to name. Most shows have some of these features, but Arifureta has all of them. Thus, it is the most Isekai show anyone could ever watch. It is not everyone’s cup of tea, but those who love it, love it to the ends of the world. The first season of the show did very well commercially despite its low budget and the terrible CGI that it had because of it, and because of that, we are now at Season 2 of the show.If you liked Season 1 of Arifureta, you would also like Arifureta Season 2 Episode 1. It felt like a good continuation to the plot of the first season, and the episode flew gracefully as one lost track of time while watching it. It set up the new adventure of the Hajime gang well, and I liked that the original class that got Isekai’d was also given some attention here, as the show jumped around and skipped a lot of stuff in season one.The characters are all back and in form for the second go-around. Say what you will about other aspects of the show, you can’t deny that Arifureta has some beautifully designed characters, especially the fairer sex. I like the personalities of all of them, but Shia is definitely overshadowed as more and more characters keep getting added to the harem. Speaking of, I like how Hajime only has this harem out of obligation and doesn’t give anyone apart from Yue any expectations. While I’m not a fan of the harem, I don’t mind it this time around because of how it is handled. Overall, a solid start by the series. alongside the usual fantasy creatures that one gets in a show such as this, like orcs, elves, and some generic formless monsters.

For good or worse, it\'s still quite mixed.For the sequel that\'s led by Corpse Party director Akira Iwanaga, the story is (obviously) continued from the events of Season 1 that...ended with Volume 4 of the LN, and the continuation that\'s heralded between the leftovers of Volume 4 to Volume 6 of the LN, which is in my mind, a huge improvement from the last that doesn\'t feel rushed for the viewers. Everything is where it should be with no excuses of cut content, just full on trash enjoyment values, which I really breathe a sigh of relief after watching the horrendous prequel 2.5 years back.Unsurprisingly, Hajime and his harem gang are back (and yes, including his class of heroes which I thought are always brain-dead niceties), and they get a fair bit more action in the sequel continuation. The difference is now with new characters like the mer-folk/dagon-type demi-humans and the whole Demon Army side of things, where only now it gets frenetic with stakes at hand. The young mer-folk Myu is a new addition to Hajime\'s gang at the tail-end of Season 1, but her inclusion this season does provide some resting moments, other than always being in peril with their lives on the line in the situations that they face in the Grand Guen Volcano, to back home in Myu\'s birthplace of Erisen. Of course, what\'s left to say more than the eventual conflict of Hajime and the Demon Army of both demons and classmates being evil, that\'s a thing.As to be expected, everyone will bite back at the overall presentation, and this still feels like ass, though not as bad as how much Season 1 was effed upside down with the last-minute production changes. Studio asread. is still here, albeit with yet another studio\'s help: studio MOTHER, replacing the intended White Fox in the 3DCG department. It honestly doesn\'t feel bad to finally see Arifureta adapted in decency, though this is still a far cry from its potential.Though I\'m quite saddened to say that the OST wasn\'t as strong as Season 1, but who I am kidding myself since it was pretty much the same as before, except for the theme songs obviously. Void_Chords set an insanely high bar with their banger of an OP 2.5 years ago (and is still a fantastic song to this day), and though MindaRyn is beginning to build her reputation as an esteemed Anisong artist, it just feels night and day when compared between the two. Even with DracoVirgo\'s kinda lackluster ED for Season 1, though FantasticYouth did a better job, both songs just aren\'t really my taste and sound quite average.Even as a ""restart / reboot"" to the series by doing the usual adaptation practices right, Ryo Shirakome\'s Arifureta as a whole, just is not a good Isekai, and even if Season 1 was heaps of terribad with some good points to it, Season 2...just felt like there wasn\'t any ""fun"" injected into it with its overall serious tone that it would carry from start to finish. I am glad that the sequel fixed up the vast majority of the glaring issues of the prequel, though at the expense of feeling numb to watch any more of Arifureta.

Just like movies like The Room, it was very enjoyable to see it as schlock that unironically tries to take itself seriously and fails at every step. The second season no longer has that appeal simply because it’s not so bad anymore. It’s actually better and that makes it worse.You might be a bit confused here, so let me explain. The horrible script and animation have improved in the second season and now they are just bad. The edgy revengeporn is gone and...so is the harem building aspect. Basically, the show lost everything that made it bad and turned into a generic isekai about an overpowered bland mc and his harem fighting the demon lord and his generals. If you noticed, we humans tend to remember the very good and the very bad, while at the same time forgetting anything that is mediocre and forgettable. The second season falls in the latter kind.Even if you see past that issue, the second season also falls victim of the development phase of any story. The first season is usually the introduction to all the main characters, while the second has the task to develop them in some sort of fashion. There is hardly much of that going on. It mostly introduced the main antagonists, the demon lord generals and the evil apostles and there were fights where even the overpowered mc had to struggle more than usual. That aside, nothing much changed and I doubt most would give a damn about seeing any of the stock characters that comprise this run of the mill set up getting some sort of character development. Whatever fun you could find in the first season was just seeing the bland mc steamrolling his enemies and gathering a bunch of paper-thin harem archetypes with edgy revenge in mind and horrible CGI fights to accompany them. Now that all that are gone, so is the hook of the whole thing. The plot was never serious, and trying to develop it would leave everyone uninterested.In a nutshell, the second season gets a higher average score than the first, but also an even smaller recommendation from me. so is the harem building aspect.

For me, this second season was 7, but overall i guess it is 6. It was less enjoyable than the first one, but did improve in some ways.If you absolutely hated the 1st season, the 2nd one will not be any better. There are less coldblood Hajime moments, less cool ass pulls, less edgelord... All of the things that made arifureta distinguish itself from other harem powerfantasy isekais are less apparent in this season. This is an absolute disappointment for me, as it was mainly the reason i liked 1st season. The fact that Hajime learned from his weaknesses and...became an OP edgelord was enjoyable for me. In second season he still is, but it is way less noticeable.What got better was the characters. Yue is as enjoyable as she was in first season. Shia is way less annoying. Tio is ever so hilarious. Kaori is boring for me, but she got actual development. I also like how, dispite being a stupid harem, Hajime makes it even clearer how Yue is the only one for him. Even though he is the generic OP protagonist, he differs from others by not being the virgin indecisive character we always get in isekai. Other side characters play a more important role in this season, specially the classmates.The pacing got a LOT better.

I enjoy the show a lot. I love how overpowered the MC is, I enjoy the interactions with the Characters, and most of all its just a fun watch.Ill eventually read the light novel, but probable not any time soon though, just not enough time to read/ trying to save money.Could the monsters have be done better sure, but I mean I've seen worse.Overall, I loved it, and I hope we get a third season. "", ""Arifureta Season 1 struggled mostly with two things:1. Fucking awful CGI2. The skip it does from a whiny good for nothing MC into a budget Devil May Cry clone. I think if they have spent more time building the character it could have been decent and it was a waste.Beyond that it's what you would expect from a Harem Isekai OP MC show so if you dislike Power Fantasy with a passion there is no middle ground here. Power Fantasy is fun, but what makes Isekai fun are world building, characters and the plot itself. If some of the proportions are good enough it...can be enjoyable despite the typical tropes of the genre.What it does right is that it doesn't rely on MC fixing everything, it gives his harem a good chunk of screen time to show their own somewhat OP powers against somewhat equally OP opponents. Characters have good interactions between them and it's somewhat clear that they went for mimicking Konosuba in that regard (not like it's a bad thing). I hope that they keep improving the jokes and the delivery method as at times they are dragged out.What works for the world are the OP God who has what seems like ultimate control over the world and the fact that MC seeks no interest in picking fights with him while following his own goals. The fact that there are only so few people that force MC into doing something he isn't interested in, is good enough for the genre.Trying to pick it apart logically for things like MC pulling out more and more advanced weaponry and equipment out of his ass is the same as counting bullets in B-rated action movies. It makes no sense.I do wish next season they all collectively put even more effort, since surprisingly Season 2 came out better.(Unlike a certain Shield Hero) can be enjoyable despite the typical tropes of the genre.What it does right is that it doesn't rely on MC fixing everything, it gives his harem a good chunk of screen time to show their own somewhat OP powers against somewhat equally OP opponents.

While I did find season one to be a crappy edgefest with early PS2 cg, it was at least fun to watch in a “so bad, it’s good” kind of way. With its popularity back in summer 2019, it was going to be inevitable that it got a sequel because if there is one thing I’ve learned lately, is that if you want a sequel, your best bet is to be an Iseakai. So what do I think? Has it actually improved or has it...just mellowed in its own crappiness?Well one thing that definitely improved this season is the animation. While asread has returned, White Fox had nothing to do with this second season and newly formed studio Mother has come in to help. And would you believe it, the cg doesn’t look like complete arse. While you can tell that they reuse the same motion on loop, they actually move better and don’t look like bricks trying to move like fantasy creatures. The best example is with Tio’s dragon form in this season compared to season one, looking less blocky and moving less statically. Character designs have also more shade to it than the plain, matte look the characters had in season one. One of the biggest problems with season one was its animation and it has noticeably improved this season, even though guns still don’t have recoil in this world but at this point, this is more of a nitpick now.The story at the moment doesn’t feel like we are rushing from place to place at rapid pace. I mean,  obviously Hajime drives a Hummer so it is going to be quicker but not in a way that it feels like were rushing it. As for the actual story, there isn’t anything that is getting me hooked as it is continuing on from where season one left off with Hajime and his harem searching for more labirynths to defeat god and go home, only now that God’s apostles are starting to take notice of this. So there is now a new foil for Hajime. It does make things more interesting as they do make Hajime look less like an overpowered edgelord. Instead, it makes him look like a strong edgelord. Yeah, its not much but at least it makes the fights more interesting.The characters though are still problematic. They unsiprisingly still act like their stereotypes but thankfully, they do have a bit more depth this time. Except for Shia, her role in season two so far has been very small and you almost forget that she’s there too. Hajime still acts like an edgelord when he’s around people that not just his harem, but with Myu around, it is funny when he breaks character and acts like an overprotective father. The introduction of Kaori into Hajime’s harem makes for some interesting moments as she simply will not back down into getting into Hajime’s heart which is currently occupied by Yue at the moment. But with her inclusion in this harem has made the whole harem feel bloated. Now there are harem shows that have a larger cast than this, but Arifureta struggles to try and balance it out because we already know that Yue has won and the introduction of Kaori in this harem is trying to complicate things that don’t work because the race has already been won.The soundtrack still remains all over the place but at least its used more appropriately than season one and I am a fan of both the OP and the ED. ""Daylight"" by MindaRyn addresses the main complaint I had with season one’s OP, which was the visuals. So now we have an OP that matches the quality of the song with its visuals and the ED, ""Gedou Sanka"" by FantasticYouth, also has a great looking visual, even if it is a still image being panned out.I would honestly say that season two of Arifureta is an improvement over season one but the bar was set low so its not exactly an impressive feat. Starting off as a bad anime and moving towards a more mediocre anime doesn’t exactly sound impressive. But, it still acts as a good guilty pleasure show, only now it’s less of a sight for sore eyes. It still has some big problems carried on from season one with characters and its soundtrack, but the story is more neatly told at the moment and the animation has noticeably improved. This season isn’t going to change people’s minds however. If you thought season one was a bad show, then season two won’t necessarily change that and you actually enjoyed how bad it was then good news, you will like this one. I wasn’t expecting much considering how big of a dumpster fire season one was but at least it still continues to be at least amusing to watch.Story: 5/10Characters: 3/10Animation: 6.5/10Sound: 4.5/10My Personal Enjoyment: 6/10Overall Score: 5.0/10Recommendation: Consider it just mellowed in its own crappiness?Well one thing that definitely improved this season is the animation.

You can enjoy the Video game console however you will constantly be made uncomfortable by the burning mess that is right beside you.The meaning of this analogy is with Arifureta, you get a whole lot of good and bad, not one or another.The story for Arifureta is actually one of the best I\'ve seen for an isekai and I actually find myself immersed in the various plot twists and situations Hajime finds himself in, disregarding the at times tacky fight scenes where Hajime just...whips out a longer weapon continuously until he wins.The Main point where Arifureta falls short for me is the characters, there\'s too damn many the author tries to fit into the story and its impossible to not hate some of them, if not most. Most of the members of the harem are actually alright to me except the loli who has a really annoying voice actor, and a child character in a fan service show is just a bit too much for me personally. The majority of the characters outside the main sphere are where the main problem are for me.Hajime\'s annoying classmates never fail to piss me off for every second of screentime they suck out of the already short enough story, and they even possess less common sense and self awareness than the literal child character. The ending especially was horrible for me as they live up to the title as true bloodsuckers and line up to each get a shot of begging on their knees to Hajime for power, with only dumb one dimensional excuses to offer. ""HAJIME YOU MUST BRING ME TO GAIN IMMENSE POWER FOR I AM THE HERO"", ""HAJIME PLEASE I MUST PROTECT MY FRIENDS"". You will find no character depth nevermind even likability, painful indeed.Overall I  think if the author just dumped about half the characters in the story and just built up the cast slowly from scratch I think the series could easily reach a 7 or maybe an 8 if changes are made to combat tactics and fight scenes(little bit of time on story too), granted I do rate based on enjoyment, so don\'t expect a masterpiece. Can still be enjoyed in its current state however i recommend only if you watch for cool guns and hot women, a true connoisseur indeed. whips out a longer weapon continuously until he wins.The Main point where Arifureta falls short for me is the characters, there\'s too damn many the author tries to fit into the story and its impossible to not hate some of them, if not most.

Enjoyed the season enough to watch weekly, but wouldn\'t recommend it to a friend.Full(er) review below:...I enjoyed the action, adventure, fantasy, fan service packed (bleh) anime that was the first season, and wasn\'t disappointed with the new season. That being said, in my humble opinion Arifureta S2 is several times better than the first season, for two reasons:First, the ecchi/fan service aspect no longer takes up half the episodes.Second,  the ""annoying"" characters are toned down (don\'t you worry, they\'re still there, but less annoying).These two things alone made Arifureta S2 a much better viewing experience. This is coming from someone who did not read the manga and solely watched the anime.If you come into the show with the right mindset, it can be quite enjoyable. I expected there to still be some harem/ecchi moments (as the tags say), so I was able to muscle through and actually enjoy the OP main character action scenes and plot development that is reminiscent of an RPG game.Based on those aspects, I give this season an overall score of a 7.

I also feel just as weird writing that because this is coming from someone who still rewatches Baka to Test, BUT trash is trash. KonoSuba was also trash but I enjoyed the heck out of it. It's a vibe.ENJOYABILITY -- (6) If you like trashy anime...this will be enjoyable. If you love magical girls, a harem that is thirsty for literally no reason, and slapstick moments, then you'll like it. Personally, I enjoyed S1 a lot more because of the WORLD concept itself. I had a lot of questions, it made me think, and I'm a sucker for exploration and leveling up. S1's main pitfall was the budget, but that didn't bother me at all.WATCHABILITY -- (5) This is where I tank. Sorry The harem gets so much screen time and there are just TOO MANY damn women. I probably sound crazy, but you might be too if it gets larger while you want to learn more about the world.

The story follows a guy who gets iseakied with his entire class and gets outcast from them, before collecting the most 1d harem while being edgy and being more edgy. The plot is the most straightforward, with a very regular progression with the same plot progression and the same thing happening again and again in the same way with the same character interactions with different characters. On top of this, the characters feel extremely superficial. Almost every single...character is driven by their attraction to the MC or another character and how they like that character and that's about it. It's like the characters don’t exist other than to protect the character they like and have awkward squabbles over them. The only notable exception is a few villains that only exist to kill people and the MC who exists to be edgy. It's not like the MC couldn’t have been interesting, as his backstory was interesting; however, the author took out all the interesting plot and rushed the MC to be edgy quickly as possible. It's like every plot development is made to make it feel like “I’m 14 and this is deep” and not actual interesting plot development that makes cool characters. The fights aren’t even that enjoyable, as they are ruined by an inconsistent 2d+3d animation with the worst 3d models and animation of all time (it's on X-arm level if not worse). Occasionally there is a decent moment, but usually ruined a few seconds later by “oh look at them they had sex” or “ohhh master please step on me” in the most awkward manner. This anime feels like it was written by  Izumi Masamune (the main character of Eromanga Sensei) or someone even younger. The only thing that felt out of place was the second ED, which was actually pretty good unlike the rest of the music in the show, which was 2 meh OPs a bad ED, and badly timed and balanced OSTs that made the “development” of characters even more awkward. I maybe could enjoy this if I was in 8th grade or was a chuunibyou, but since neither of those is true, there was almost nothing enjoyable in this.Score: 2.1/10 character is driven by their attraction to the MC or another character and how they like that character and that's about it.

It's clear that all other aspects of the anime/LN, such as easy-to-follow character developments and story specifics, come second to badass fights. It makes a promise in it's writing and delivers in full, what more can you ask?First things first, I believe main characters carry anime. If the main character isn't well written, then I usually drop the anime all together. The MC in Arifureta is a tight rope balance between being jokingly edgy and not taking himself too...seriously. For an Isekai focusing on a badass power fantasy, it does a good job at writing a main character that is seemingly overpowered and a total edgelord while occasionally showing humility in that his words and actions(specifically in his less serious dialogues) are just him trying to look cool, which, in my opinion, is respectable because it's more genuine than most fictional characters are written.Story: 8The story, in my opinion, isn't Arifureta's biggest selling point. It's good enough to serve it's purpose: as a vehicle to get from one fight to the next and develope the main cast. While it's definitely not a copy paste, almost cheap, premise seen in your average seasonal Isekai nowadays, it's not exactly easy to follow, especially when it comes to the intentions of the antagonists. I wouldn't say that is a totally bad thing either, gives the story somewhere to build from and expand upon later down the line.Art:6Arifureta is only slightly above average when it comes to art style and animations compared to other action/fantasy focused anime. While the fights aren't anything to pass up and the character designs aren't abhorrent, you aren't going to see much hyped up YouTube compilations of any fights and it's easy to tell the inspirations for the character designs. The Main Character's style, in character design and abilities, totally look like a middle/high schooler chunnibyo's sketchbook fantasy drawings and it's not trying to hide it.Sound: 7The sound serves it's purpose in that the effects don't stick out too much and fits the scenes generally pretty well, but they definitely missed the chance to backup the edginess of the main character with some badass music during fights, but I'm not losing my lunch over it.Characters: 10Now my love letter to the writing of the characters in Arifureta.The main character, Hajime, is a perfect depiction of a stereotypical chunnibyo's realized power fantasy. He tends to jump back and forth between that edgelord chunnibyo and average guy personas. He does this pretty organically in a way that is relatable.The main girl, Yue, is a trope of her own. You have the typical, pretty much a joke of a trope that is the 100s of years old vampire loli, along with consistent depictions of blind faith in the main character, which is totally adorable. Other than that, she isn't insanely interesting, but that's not the end of the world.I'm lumping the rest of the main supporting cast together as the harem. Shia, the bunny girl, isn't too dynamic, just fan service and lack of care. I wouldn't mind seeing her develope as a person, but I'm not holding my breath. Tio, the dragon girl, is in a similar boat as Shia, but her intentions are more clear: to serve Hajime in a more master/servent relationship. Kaori, the fellow isekai'd classmate acting as a healer/priestess, is definitely the most dynamic of the main supporting cast due to her motivations being all over the place and she definitely developed clearly as a character throughout the series.The antagonists of the series, in general, are kinda conveluted and all their motivations aren't made amazingly clear in the anime series thus far.The other isekai'd classmates act as a more boring foil for Hajime and definitely, in my opinion, leave a lot to be desired.The teacher, Aiko, is a total cutie and is most definitely best girl of the series. There is no debate, I will not be taking questions. seriously. For an Isekai focusing on a badass power fantasy, it does a good job at writing a main character that is seemingly overpowered and a total edgelord while occasionally showing humility in that his words and actions(specifically in his less serious dialogues) are just him trying to look cool, which, in my opinion, is respectable because it's more genuine than most fictional characters are written.Story: 8The story, in my opinion, isn't Arifureta's biggest selling point. It's good enough to serve it's purpose: as a vehicle to get from one fight to the next and develope the main cast. While it's definitely not a copy paste, almost cheap, premise seen in your average seasonal Isekai nowadays, it's not exactly easy to follow, especially when it comes to the intentions of the antagonists. I wouldn't say that is a totally bad thing either, gives the story somewhere to build from and expand upon later down the line.Art:6Arifureta is only slightly above average when it comes to art style and animations compared to other action/fantasy focused anime. While the fights aren't anything to pass up and the character designs aren't abhorrent, you aren't going to see much hyped up YouTube compilations of any fights and it's easy to tell the inspirations for the character designs. The Main Character's style, in character design and abilities, totally look like a middle/high schooler chunnibyo's sketchbook fantasy drawings and it's not trying to hide it.Sound: 7The sound serves it's purpose in that the effects don't stick out too much and fits the scenes generally pretty well, but they definitely missed the chance to backup the edginess of the main character with some badass music during fights, but I'm not losing my lunch over it.Characters: 10Now my love letter to the writing of the characters in Arifureta.The main character, Hajime, is a perfect depiction of a stereotypical chunnibyo's realized power fantasy. He tends to jump back and forth between that edgelord chunnibyo and average guy personas. He does this pretty organically in a way that is relatable.The main girl, Yue, is a trope of her own. You have the typical, pretty much a joke of a trope that is the 100s of years old vampire loli, along with consistent depictions of blind faith in the main character, which is totally adorable. Other than that, she isn't insanely interesting, but that's not the end of the world.I'm lumping the rest of the main supporting cast together as the harem. Shia, the bunny girl, isn't too dynamic, just fan service and lack of care. I wouldn't mind seeing her develope as a person, but I'm not holding my breath. Tio, the dragon girl, is in a similar boat as Shia, but her intentions are more clear: to serve Hajime in a more master/servent relationship.

The first two episodes are all about Hajime\'s growth as a person, dealing with the loss of his friends, trying to wrap his head around one of them betraying him, and sacrificing pieces of himself (quite literally, some of the time) in order to survive.It\'s classed as a ""harem"" anime, technically, and while there are elements of it (and plenty of fan service, if you\'re into that), the story holds up on its own.

He's got a good heart but he's kind of a loser. He's socially clumsy. He gets bullied and he never really fights back but somehow, he always comes through in the clutch. That's how our hero is in this series in the first episode, except that he is 17. What follows is not a spoiler because it all happens in the first episode. By the way, the anime starts somewhere around the third chapter of the manga. The anime just sort...of starts in the middle. There is no real explanation of what is going on other than a few hints. It's a fairly obvious plot. You've seen it plenty of times. A high school class is suddenly sucked into another world where they must fight monsters and demons. You don't really see that happen. It is sort of alluded to in flashes. The story really starts when the boy-hero falls into an abyss. There he manages to survive long enough to eat some monster meat. This gives him more powers. He then uses his newly acquired powers to kill more monsters and acquire more powers. In the meantime, he comes to believe that the world has always had it in for him and his only course of action is to become ruthless and to take what he wants without compunction. He becomes single-minded in his desire to win at any cost, and yet there remains a deeply buried sense of good. It's very unusual for an anime boy-hero to be this decisive and to put his decisions into action without hesitation, even if those actions contravene accepted norms of social behaviour. The title word means mundane, ordinary. That's what the boy-hero is at the beginning but he certainly doesn't stay that way long.This series had great potential, starts off really serious and dark but the tone completely changes from episode 6 of Season 1. They obviously tried their hand at comedy/harem but failed miserably to deliver anything funny or thrilling.The character design is really nice, but everything else looks like grey goo with uninspired design and one of the worst animation I have ever seen. I read that the manga is fantastic, but the anime failed to find its identity and couldn't stick to a genre.

This time you get the clique storyline like many others. The difference is many stories don't get what this does with season 1 and effectively start here with season 2. That is fantastic but this time it is about as a 6 as it can get. The story isn't bad it is just average. The scenes with Noint were great but demons are literally copy and paste.The art style is good for...the most part but has very copy and paste enemies like I said that they are literally moving the exact same way as each other. I would say this isn't the worst thing ever but is far from the best since the rest of the show is pretty good.The sound is fine, nothing special, lacks any oomph! but then the voices are pretty good. Generally, the OST is okay.The development goes quite nicely, Eri Nakamura is fantastic and so is Noint. Hajime has become every other harem protagonist ever to exist no matter what they try to do to change that. Can be a bit uncomfortable at times as pointed out by other characters too.Like I say, it is a 6/10 through and through. the most part but has very copy and paste enemies like I said that they are literally moving the exact same way as each other.

I\'m a sucker for isekai, especially with a mix of harem involved. It was good enough that I would watch season 2. So how was it...????Honestly, decent and enjoyable. It\'s not as good as the first few episodes of S1, but whereas S1 started strong and ended boring, the reverse is true here. S2\'s first 3-4 episodes are kind of yawners, but then towards the end they crank it up. Here\'s a quick run down.Characters: 7/10There\'s really just 3 great character in this anime. Nagumo, Yue, and Kaori. Yue is...decent as Nagumo\'s main love interest. She doesn\'t say much, but her bluntness and simple words says a lot about who she is. Kaori surprised me the most. She was annoying S1 and she starts off annoying this season too, but she probably had the most drastic character development. I grew to like her quite well. And of course the MC Nagumo is great. That said, I\'ve always been fond of MC\'s who aren\'t wusses and stupid idiots, so it\'s always refreshing to see an MC stick to his guns (pun intended). The rest of the cast are forgettable (well maybe not Yaegashi, Kaori\'s best friend- she is okay). Most annoying character is definitely their sensei Aiko. All she does is cry, complain, and then cry again. Really useless. But I guess since she has the label of ""sensei"", they have to keep her alive even though she has been completely irrelevant to the story.Action: 7/10There are some really cool action scenes, but the reason I don\'t give it a higher score is that a lot of magic and things that go on aren\'t really explain. Lot\'s of explosions and summons...if you can just ignore the logics and enjoy action scenes, then yeah you\'ll like it.VA: 8/10Mostly good, but I felt some of the girl\'s voices were too high.Animation: 7/10Some parts were really good, but for the majority you can tell it\'s kind of lacking. It\'s cool though- it\'s not terrible by any means. What really saves the show is the character designs. Some of the coolest outfits I\'ve seen in a long time.Music: 9/10Really love the music. For sure adding a bunch to my play list.Story: 8/10And we get to what I think is the strongest part about this anime. No spoilers of course, but the second half of this season, a lot of things unwind and the plot begins to make more sense. There are betrayals and plot twists and everything. It\'s actually pretty well written. Not a mastery, but damn I found it enjoyable. It\'s such a shame the season starts off slow. The over all concept is still isekai, but I love how they only encompass that theme as the over all plot is much MUCH bigger.Should you watch this show? If you like season 1, yes. If you like isekai\'s, yes. If you like harem animes, mmmmaybe (it\'s not really a harem tbh). But I can see why some are turn off by this type of show. Eh, give it a shot if you\'re on the fence I say. I think you\'ll be somewhat surprised like me. decent as Nagumo\'s main love interest.

Good story, impeccable character development and a strong mc. Couldn't ask for a better isekai anime. You can't say your an anime fan if you haven't watched this masterpieceThere are many reasons why this anime is a hit, but the number 1 reason would be Nagaimo (MC), he literally started from the bottom to become the strongest. His character is also very interesting, he acts like he doesn't care and takes down anyone who stands in his path.Another reason; HAREM!! The MC (Nagaimo) is always surrounded by beautiful women who are loyal to him.

Hope you enjoy the show!! shows that strength/power can attract women.I Can't say enough, you just to watch it to find out more. Hope you enjoy the show!!"", 'This typically isn\'t the type of anime I review. Generally I review anime with an enthralling story or, oppositely, ones that are complete garbage (looking at you Tokyo Revengers and Isekai Cheat Magician). However mediocre this anime may be in terms of plot development and overall quality, my enjoyment of this series is independent of any real thought or reason...I just love this series and no one can change my mind. That said I understand the divisiveness, because regardless of how much I enjoy this series, I can admit it would be difficult to rank it anywhere close to heavy hitters like Death Note or...Fate.To start out, I will be spoiling a little, so please be aware of that moving forward (although, story wise, I wouldn\'t say there\'s much to spoil). Arifureta to me is like a bad relationship: I know there\'s nothing of substance and I\'m not in love with it, but I still keep coming back because of very specific moments of inexplicable joy...and out of familiarity I suppose. If you want to know on purely objective standard what is bad about this series, there are plenty of other reviews that drag it through the mud, which are not far off base, but I\'d rather try and win you over by explaining what makes me so pleased as a viewer.As I mentioned, the story is sub par. Basically it\'s like any other isekai where X protagonist gets ""isekai\'d"" to another world, becomes immeasurably strong, and acquires a harem along with everything else he\'s ever dreamed that would have been unattainable in his previous life. Arifureta scratches a particular itch though. It\'s greatness boils down to quite a few things, but first and foremost, for me at least, is due to the characters and how they interact. The best example of this is the comeback story told in the first season. This weakling of a guy is betrayed and forced into becoming stronger in order to survive, and by the end of the season he not only puts those who did not support him in their place but redefines the meaning of comeback. Yes he ""comes back"" an edgelord, but it\'s with a sense of refinement that only this series can provide. Season 2 just carries on this legacy, but instead of a come back we are presented with a worthwhile follow up to how that strength and prowess can ultimately benefit someone like Hajime, the protagonist, after a given set of time.A definite plus this season was getting to see how Hajime\'s powers have evolved, along with his fellow team members. Yue is OP as always, but we see a lot more from Tio and Shia this time around. This definitely changes the overall dynamic from the first season where everything fell on Hajime\'s shoulders (like pulling a Hummer or revolver from out of nowhere while having little to no knowledge of how they are actually constructed...I never understood this). Since everyone is basically competent this time around, I had a much better viewing experience getting to see pretty impressive fight scenes with characters I\'ve grown attached to over time. As much as I trash the story and development, there was progress in quite a few aspects.I also deeply appreciated the villains this time around. Last season it was made clear the gods of their world are evil and need to be put down, however nothing much came of that. I appreciated the return to this concept: gods creating a world in which humans carry on praising them without the knowledge that the gods are in fact the true enemy of humanity. It\'s just interesting to me. Along this line, the demons are equally interesting since they seem to be in cahoots with said gods or at least ""the enemy of my enemy"" kind of situation. Noint is an angel of sorts that we are introduced to within the very first moments of the second season, and she makes for an interesting ""boss"" with a cool yet subtle design. To be honest (spoiler here) I didn\'t want her to die, or at least her bad side. I kind of hoped to see her join the party, but we at least get the next best thing and have Kaori take over her form, in not so elegant terms. This was a double positive since I wasn\'t a huge fan of Kaori\'s design to begin with. This is a great course correction for me, otherwise how would she even begin to compete ""looks wise"" with Yue, Shia, or Tio. Another prevalent villain, the demon Freid is humorous as well and is actually successful in threatening the lives of Hajime and his party during their first battle. I didn\'t think it possible but had Hajime been on his own or had somethings not go how they did, it could have very well been the end for him. Regardless, a show is always more interesting with more stakes.Now I\'d like to address something that is commonly missing from harems that consistently annoys the hell outta me, which is the concept of desire. For some reason, possibly for comedic effect, the protagonist never ""gets any"" (censoring myself for MAL)! This applies to reverse harems as well...along with a specific woman/man never being chosen as best partner. Women fall at their feet and yet they never sleep with any of them! It\'s so frustrating. It\'s possible this is the difference between USA and Japan. Maybe we\'re deviants over here, but I find it hard to believe that NOTHING besides accidental bosom grabs and the occasional nip slip occur when it\'s clear there is a chemistry of the adult variety among the participants. Now Hajime doesn\'t actually sleep with all of his harem, but he does at least have a consistent partner for these matters in Yue, our favorite vampire (well one of them at least). This is where Horimiya and SAO do it right as well. Let\'s get real, over a certain age it\'s only natural for relationships to grow and activities of the adult variety occur, so if a show attempts to convince me otherwise... I get irritated. If they won\'t show it, they should at the very least elude to it as they did in SAO the first season with Kirito visiting Asuna\'s home for dinner. Apologies for that uncomfortable rant but I feel this is something that should be called out. The more dynamic the protagonist\'s relationship can be with their harem members, the more growth we can see from their relationships overall. Basically, I\'m looking for more realism and at least Arifureta is honest with its viewers about how men really work. Get that bashful white knight crap outta here, and good luck convincing me any man below the age of 30 is not constantly on the hunt to get some, even if it is based in Japan.I liked basically every episode, whether a battle was occurring or simple fan service (which they could have had more of imo). If I had to pick a specific moment that stood out to me, it would be, spoiler, Kaori\'s death and rebirth, or just Eri\'s betrayal overall. I can safely say I hate both her and that failure of a man Daisuke. This season did great building up that moment of betrayal to her classmates, and especially getting me to sympathize with those she attacked. I was definitely disappointed she did not get what was coming to her in the end and instead got away, and it\'s this feeling of empathy and concern for the characters where I can best describe why Arifureta is such a good show to me.One quote from Hajime perfectly encapsulates why I enjoy this series: ""It\'s not enough to just do what\'s within your power. You\'ve got to want to do something so badly that you\'re willing to gain the power to do it"". One of the heaviest quotes from an anime I didn\'t expect any depth from.This series overall is just fun for me, and I realize there are plenty others that don\'t feel the same. It feels like watching a Nascar race or riding a roller coaster. Yes there are dull moments due to lack of certain elements, but generally it\'s a ride that can be enjoyed if the best elements are subjectively meaningful to you. Yes it\'s not a deep anime thriving with endless lore, where every character is crafted perfectly and every moment throughout to the Nth degree. That said, there is definitely enough wholesomeness, action, and unique development to hold your attention. Characters are great as well if given the chance. The main factor here is to let your own experience decide, and not let reviews or memes sway what you could potentially see as a good anime. Again though, I wouldn\'t blame anyone for feeling opposite to me. Arifureta is my guilty pleasure, but it deserves to be seen as more than that in my opinion if only given the chance. All I have to say now is hopefully we\'ll get to see a season 3 at some point, because I\'ve had a lot of fun with what\'s been presented thus far.

The first season skips way too much and their fighting scenes is way to downgraded (it wont be an exaggeration to be called trash). However, during season 2 things seem to slow down a bit and their fighting scenes had improved a lot (super much). Especially the fighting scenes near the few ending episodes I would say it really suck me right in.Of course on how the anime ended, it was fine and reassuring but there is this frustration built up that have nowhere to go (I will not spoil), seeing how it ended in...an episode (it makes you feel like OMG COME ON JUST A ......

Namely that the protagonist isn't a pussy. Early on in the story he comes to a realization that in order to survive, anything goes. And anyone that stands in his way deserves a bullet between the eyes, no mercy given.This makes the show quite refreshing as there's no endless morality, goody-goody Naruto like talking people to death in order...to achieve an accord and have peace, nonsense. The MC of this show kills the villains ruthlessly unless they get out of his way, because ultimately he doesn't care beyond that. If they're in his way, they die. If not, they can piss off.The harem aspect of the show is also not that bad. For one, the MC has a clear chosen lover. There's no excessively awkward courting and their sexual romance is confirmed early on, and will not falter.Additional members to the harem are not welcomed but rather reluctantly accepted for their combat value or knowledge. And the MC simply chooses not to turn away anyone who chooses to be by his side. But romantically he does not branch out. So it's a rather one sided harem for once. One might call it similar to Highschool DxD, but less erotic. And the MC actually gets some instead of blue balling themselves indefinitely.In terms of story, it's not particularly noteworthy, but serviceable and there's an interesting wider story that needs to be addressed in future seasons, as we are leaving off in the middle of the story in this Season 2.Arguably the weakest part of the show is the very underdeveloped motivations and characters of the villains. Some of which are so laughable that it's hard to even wrap one's head around. Ultimately it doesn't drag the show down too much because the MC doesn't really care, and so we're not exactly incentivized to care either. But it does seem a bit silly when a villain who ends up killing thousands does so because of what can only be called a teenage crush. That seems rather ridiculous.All in all, it's a fun Isekai for those that enjoy MC's who actually get stuff done and aren't perpetually doubting, blueballing and otherwise wasting their time. to achieve an accord and have peace, nonsense.

Ultimately it doesn't drag the show down too much because the MC doesn't really care, and so we're not exactly incentivized to care either. But it does seem a bit silly when a villain who ends up killing thousands does so because of what can only be called a teenage crush. That seems rather ridiculous.All in all, it's a fun Isekai for those that enjoy MC's who actually get stuff done and aren't perpetually doubting, blueballing and otherwise wasting their time."", 'Great show to shut your brain off and watch and has plenty of badass scenes to hype you up. Better than most new isekai. However, the show is pretty frustrating as well. But that is just me personally. For example, the classmates piss me off, especially that Kaori like she is soo extra. And also the classmates have strong generic ideals but are powerless to carry out those ideals and cry about when the MC does smt they do not agree with. But I guess that sort of adds some realism to the story and characters so I ignore it. BUT it is frustrating given...I watch isekai to escape reality and get hyped up.

Anyhow, alright show if you are into Isekai.', ""Too many flaws to reach the passing grade.3 years ago I watched the first season of Arifureta and I ended up liking it a lot, so much that I gave it a 7/10 mark very close to the 8. Apart from the classical Isekai scenario, the plot is immediately directed towards an astonishing character development of the protagonist, Hajime Nagumo, fighting against everyone and everything just to survive and so becoming literally OP. Deserved. He lost and he gained. I have to admit that 6 marks out of 7 were thanks to Hajime's character and personality. The biggest flaw was CGI, undoubtfully: it's not a...baby flaw, it's literally an eyesight ruiner, but as long as it was the main big flaw (there were other problems, but not so serious), I could live with that. And I also understand why most of people found this anime deplorable and obnoxious.Now I decided to face the second season and I won't deny it: I had big hopes. At first, I noticed that the CGI had a little poor short minor baby improvement and I was happy about that. Then, I faced episodes from 2 to 10. I didn't imagine it could have been such a torture. It took me many days to watch these 8 miserable episodes, between a yawn and a disbelief. Nothing important happens and when it does, something stupid happens to resolve the problem and the shit is served. I fought against myself for so long. I was gonna drop it and I was suffering because of this. I didn't want to give up to everyone who said this anime was pure shit. I believed in Hajime Nagumo. Then suddenly, the 11th episode. Something happens. Plot twists, fights, revenges, drama, even some good chats between characters (such a piece of news)...After all, I rearranged all of my thoughts and I couldn't manage to give more than 5 out of 10. I can't give a 6 to an anime that forced me to speed up the video in order not to lose too much time with useless shit. In particular becuase the useless shit lasted something like the 80% of the anime. I don't even know if I'd like to be alive when the 3rd season will be airing.

In my opinion this is an important reason why many people prefer this season. Season 1 was rushed af to get the main cast together in order to be be ready for a second season. This was surprisingly my enjoyment in season 1 the ass pulls, the dungeons, the fights, him developing into a badass is what made season 1 such a thrill to watch. In the other hand we don't get much development or world building in the grand scheme because of this. This is where season 2 takes a slower...pacing to actually build the story and give moments to each character.Season 2 feels slower and won't be as fun, so if that was the reason why you enjoyed season 1 you might be slightly disappointed.

D.C.II S.S.: Da Capo II Second Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3627/DCII_SS__Da_Capo_II_Second_Season,"[""Hello everyone! Yes, I'm that girl who gave the first season of Da Capo II a 5 and bashed it! I'm very happy that I did gave the second season a chance. I'll tell you why. Enjoy my review (if you can)!StoryWhat to say about the Story? Did it improved? Yes, it surely did. When I first started this I could already see that we finally get our Otome and Yume-moments, which I missed in the first season. The whole season is focussed on Otome and Yume who both seem to like their ''onii-chan'', Yoshiyuki. It's very easy to see how much Yume likes him,...since we get lots of moments where she tries to be with him or blushes very hard. For Otome, it isn't really shown that she tries as hard as Yume but she hangs out with Yoshiyuki the most. Some weird accidents are happening which bothers Otome. Yoshiyuki notices this and helps her to investigate the weird accidents that happen every single day, and the weirdest thing, in none of them someone got hurt. Yoshiyuki and Otome both can use magic as well, and Otome refers herself as ''a magician of justice'' and tries to do something about the accidents. They later get involved with the Sakura Three and read that it can make your wishes come true. Ofcourse, they don't believe it, but Anzu tells them a story of a girl who made a wish to the Sakura Three, which was granted. It turns out that that girl was her. In each accident a girl with blond hair was seen by bypassers. Rara, who could it be?ArtThis might have improved a little from the first season as well. Even though there isn't alot of difference. I think the animation is well made and the characters move very naturally. The characterdesigns are good as well, I really like everyone's appearance!SoundAh, the sound, the music... It's not the most special, but I DO like it. The opening-theme, Sakura Amaneku Sekai is sung by yozuca. I really like the background-music of the song and the singing isn't bad at all! It's nice to listen to it before the episode begins. Then, what about the ending-theme? It's Bokutachi no Yukue, sung by CooRie. Probably my favourite song from Da Capo II Second Season! I really like the calm feeling it gives you. For the background-music in the episodes, I think I heard it when it was needed. They do not over-use sounds but it's worth a 8.CharacterImproved! For sure. I'm kinda glad to see that Minatsu isn't in this season, one of the reasons I like this much more. Everyone else is still there, but I'm happy that Koko's role in the series isn't a main one anymore! The three main characters of this season are Yoshiyuki and the Asakura-sisters, Yume and Otome. I'm very glad that I got to see more of both of them, since their part in the first season was just a supporting part. I think they saved everything for the second season! I think that Yoshiyuki will pick one of them (Yume or Otome) at the end of this season, it's unclear for me who it will be. I personally hope that it will be Otome, because I don't really like Yume, she reminds me too much of Nemu (which I didn't like as well). But that's just my personal opinion, everyone can hope whatever they want!EnjoymentEnjoyment... well, I do enjoy this! If you want a very ''special, or something like that'' anime, then this isn't something for you. Even the second season doesn't have something that makes it stand out, but still, it's enjoyable to watch! I don't know why, even though it isn't special, the second season does have some kind of feeling when you watch it. This is great in days that you have nothing to do or just want to watch something!OverallWell, I LIKE following this and watching the episodes. This really surprised me when I look back at the first season again, which was just too boring. I might could have even skipped the first season, but hey, just watch it to say that you did. If you dropped the first season and haven't started on this one for that reason, or you did finish it and hated it, give the second season a chance! It's much better and you might, just as me, enjoy this one. I wouldn't hurt you to just try watching it, right? Especially the people who missed Otome and Yume SHOULD watch this!Is this really the same girl who wrote the review about the first season? Yep, it's me!

II S.S., The real story of Da Capo II which makes the first season look like a filler. This is probably the last of Da Capo, and if not, this is surely the final story about Hatsunejima and its never withering Sakura Trees. A lot of things are explained here and it also shows some history. Most definitely a MUST WATCH for Da Capo fans.The story is better than ever, but it\'s a little disappointing that the other things were completely left out. This is a very sad and lonely Da Capo.

Everything and everyone looked fine just like the first season, sadly, the characters are still not illustrated that well also like in the first season (they still have not so good side views), but it\'s not that bad, not so much of a major setback. The art still has a very good overall.The sounds are as good as the first season. Everything blends well with the scenes with such beautiful music. The only problem here is that the OP and ED music are not that attractive. Most viewers would just skip it if they can.The characters are the same as the first season but most of them are just background now. An unknown classmate is also featured a few seconds of air time with Wataru which felt like ""eh?"". Anyway, Yoshiyuki is not thickheaded anymore, but her sister Yume becomes the stubborn and irritating one this time in the early parts. Junichi is finally shown here which is great but Amakase will never be seen or heard of again, and so are the old characters.This is now a serious show. It will only be funny on the first episode and no one will even attempt to hit Suginami anymore. Still, viewers will enjoy a fun start, a very dramatic continuation and a beautiful finish. ever before, but they can\'t wither it so easily just like they always did 50 years ago.

Like its predecessor, the story revolves around the mysterious events in the island of Hatsunejima. Although unlike the original Da Capo, the male lead has TWO 'sisters' that are very close to him. Drama ensues...The character designs for DCII:SS is magnificent, especially those of Shirakawa Nanaka.

Da Capo II first season left a bad taste in my mouth with very little plot development and really unentertaining.  Similarly Da Capo Second Season did the same.  Nevertheless, I sat through the 13 weeks of the show and although it was a bit of a slow start at first, it really picked up half way through the series.  The last few episodes really were emotional and by far the best Da Capo episodes in all 4 series.Story: Slow start, but really developed afterwards.  There were a...few plot holes though that I continued to remain unsatisfied with.Art: wasn't great, but it may just be the raw and subber quality I was watching, but there was a huge difference in the last episode and thus I give it a 7 rather than a 5 since once I get my hands on the DVD version, it will be far better than what I was watching most of the time.Music: in Da Capo II in general, music pieces were just spectacular and I'm still dazzled by it.  The bgms were great when coming to the emotional points of the show.Character: Not as much development, but really dwelled on Otome, Yume, and Yoshiyuki, which gave it the nice emotional touch when the plot really developed.Enjoyment: Would have been great if more Nanaka was shown.  I really was looking forward to her since her 50 year older grandmother was like the star of the first two seasons.  Plust Nanaka is just as attractive, but really didn't get much screen time, so :P 9.Overall: Probably the best Da Capo season out of all 4.  Possibly on par with the first, but in general, it really had its high points compared to the rest and really stood out.

Frankly speaking, I\'m sick of this ""A popular guy who is kind to everyone but dumb enough to realize other\'s affection"". Any cliche situations can be found here and the most annoying thing is when that MC being dragged around by his friends without being able to decline. Oh, man.Junichi from DC I is a tiny bit better for me considering his sense of humor, but Yoshiyuki is REALLY boring, except when the series reaches its end where the sadness built up.The only interesting characters for me are Minatsu which is handled much better than its counterpart, Miharu from DC I and the Asakura sisters (but only near the end). Beside that, mediocre to the letter.Continuation: 3I really don\'t understand why this is called D.C II SS. Except the same characters, everything from DC II seems dissapear without explanation. The most obvious one is Yoshiyuki\'s relation with Koko. Well, they mention it a bit in ep 2 (CMIIW) but after that, she was thrown away from the story. I really hope that the relationship and the problems could contribute in either adding more flames in the conflict in SS or solving it.Shortly speaking, I think I will feel better if I watched DC II SS without watching DC II.Plot: 6This score is for DC II SS WITHOUT DC II because as I say, there is no important continuation whatsoever, including the plot. I really love how they built up the tension towards the end of the series. The road to climax is really good and tear-jerking. I would be glad to give this 8 or 9 if the ending is not as cliched as it is. Sola\'s ending is waaaay much better than this.Enjoyment: 5Good story, nice plot, boring characters, and horrible continuation. Well, at least I enjoy the story.Overall: 6Shortly speaking, it will be good series if there is no DC II and they handle the characters and the ending better. better than DC I with more vibrant colors imo.Sound: 6Opening is good (DC II SS), but others are really weak to leave impression on me.Chara: 4This is the worst problem with DC series.

In the first episode, it was only a review to help us remember the characters of this anime. But we can tell that Yume is currently fall in love with Yoshiyuki and jealous if her sister, Otome, have fun together with him.Asakura Jun'ichi will be appeared again after 50 years as Yume and Otome's grandfather.Well, I think this anime will be a excellent choice to collect since the story isn't too hard to understand and the tsundere Yume is very cute.It would be the best if you watch it from the...very first series (Da Capo) very first series (Da Capo)"", 'Da Capo II is quite entertaining, though I don&rsquo;t like the insensitivity of male protagonist. Koko being the girlfriend of Yoshiyuki is damn nonsense, or I mean it&rsquo;s useless in whole story of the series. The series make her like one of the main heroine but it&rsquo;s not. Some concept of the story is quite similar to the concept of the anime AIR TV, SOLA, KANON, CLANNAD, and TO HEART. I think Da Capo I is still the best. ', ""The original anime was set on a modern-day Japanese island. However, the story takes place 53 years later, and it appears that not much has changed. The only significant difference is that robots are now a thing, but not everyone accepts them. There are riots from people who worry about being replaced by robots. Robots are uncommon and have limited functionality, with no free will, thoughts, or feelings. Meanwhile, phones remain the same as they were in the early 2000s.The story is not a typical harem anime. It actually feels more like a love triangle. The main focus of the story is not on...romance but on Yoshiyuki's relationship with one particular girl and Minatsu's awakening as a student in a world where robots aren't accepted by everyone. The plot is predictable at times and confusing at others, but it's a refreshing departure from typical harem anime. The conclusion is satisfying, and there are no sequel baiting or cliffhangers, despite the existence of a second season.However, the 53-year gap between the original anime and this one has caused some debate. The continuity is questionable, and there are potential plot holes. For instance, Sakura hasn't aged a bit, and Suginami appears to be the same as he was in the previous season. Yoshiyuki himself has a different surname from his sisters, but no explanation is given for this. It's also unclear how he is related to characters like Sakura and the Asakura sisters. Nanaka Shirakawa is likely Kotori's daughter, and Maika Mizukoshi is the descendant of the Mizukoshi sisters. The surname discrepancy suggests that there may have been failed marriages or single mothers in the family line.The animation style in the show is similar to the original Da Capo, especially the female characters, who look almost the same. This similarity is somewhat justified as some characters are descendants of those in the original. However, the overall quality of the character designs is disappointing, as they appear too similar to the original ones. This made me think I was watching the original show by mistake. Only Sakura looks exactly the same as in the original, which annoyed me a little. I wish they had made her age appropriately instead of following the same plot as the original.This show is not a harem one, as a choice is made early on, and the plot is actual. However, the romantic aspect feels slice-of-life-like and is not the main focus. There are some issues with the connection to the original Da Capo, and some things are unexplained, which I found annoying.

However, don't expect everything to be perfectly resolved in the end."", 'Da Capo II SS is a continuation of Da Capo II except this time it focuses on the Asakura sisters and Sakurai (finally!). If you were waiting for more of the sisters\' involvement in the series, your wait is over. This does mean that the other characters (i.e. Koko, Nanaka, etc.) get very little air time so if you were rooting for more of those, you\'re better off re-watching the original Da Capo II.I think this sequel might even rival the intensity of the original series, though the Jun\'ichi & Nemu combo is pretty hard to beat. As demonstrated by the series image, this series...takes a dramatic turn in the latter half and is concluded by a somewhat abrupt ending. Despite this, it still holds its own thanks to a great character cast and a superb animation.Animation:The animation is greatly improved over the original Da Capo (having gone back and watched a bit of that). It is pretty similar to Da Capo II but we also meet (gasp) grandfather Jun\'ichi. As mentioned before, you\'re going to get a lot of Yume and Otome in this one, and so I believe my younger self upped the score here.Sound:Unlike the original Da Capo II, I found the opening theme quite refreshing and very in tune with the original Da Capo. The BGM is vibrant and reflects the mood of the series very well. As for voice actors, you get the same great cast as the original Da Capo II but since Otome and Yume get a lot more airtime, you get a lot more of their voices too. Both characters are very dynamic in this series and the seiyuu do an outstanding job at portraying the appropriate emotions.Story:The second series picks up right where the first series left off. I\'m assuming that the people interested in this have watched Da Capo II already so I won\'t give much background info. Sakurai has decided to break up with Koko and is to some extent a free man. Again the series takes on a slice of (school) life approach similar to the original Da Capo II but with an expanded role and appearance of the sisters. We find Sakurai being pampered with his sisters fixing his clothes and eating with him.The first half of the series is pretty light-hearted showing Sakurai having fun with his sisters and (occasionally) his other friends from the original series. There is a lot of evidence of how much he means to his sisters in the middle of the series, as a foreshadow of things to come. There is also a puppet play in the middle that also blatantly foreshadows what is to come (and sadly takes away the shock of what will happen near the end).The second half of the series follows the formula of the original series in which we find the main characters in anguish and unable to deal with a perplexing and painful situation. My major problem with this portion is the fact that they way overdid the sadness (similar to how it took forever to explain how powerful an energy ball in DBZ was) to the point where a happy ending would still not feel very happy due to the overwhelming period of sadness before it.The conclusion does give a twist to the series but is condensed into a single episode, the first half of which was still very sad. In other words, it felt as if the series was following a sad trend with a sudden tiny burst of happiness near the end. Regardless, I felt the ending could have been much smoother.Character:The viewer gets to learn a lot more about the talented Otome and brash-acting (though actually very timid) Yume. They have both inherited some magical abilities and use it/them throughout the series. One of the highlights is when Yume and Otome get ""drunk"" off of a non-alcoholic beverage. There is wonderful development of the two and the viewer really can tell that they care dearly for their brother.There were two peculiarities that I found while watching this show. First of all, an entire episode was essentially dedicated to Anzu Yukimura despite the fact that she plays an otherwise minimalist role in both series. Second of all, all of Sakurai\'s school friends from the first series end up being completely stagnant. We barely even see Nanaka and Koko compared to the original series. This difference felt a little unnatural though I\'m not complaining since Yume and Otome more than make up for this.Value:Overall, the series came out very strong and will be a good watch for all Da Capo fans. If you were thrown off by Da Capo SS (Aisia...) or Da Capo II (Minatsu), you\'ll be happy that the main females are once again Asakuras (and they don\'t disappoint!).

Genius Party Beyond,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6795/Genius_Party_Beyond,"['Like previous Studio 4c collaborations ""Batman: Gothic Knight"" and ""The Animatrix"", the Genius Party shorts are less about showcasing deep stories than they are about showcasing the wonders of animation.  Unlike the previously listed collaborations, the Genius Party shorts are primarily personal projects made by both established and independent animators.  The only thing that can be stated about the shorts as a whole is that they are wonderfully imaginative and colorful, and the Beyond shorts are arguably even more imaginative than the original Genius Party works.The first short, ""Gala"", directed by anime regular Mahiro Maeda of GONZO fame, is essentially a music video...with an overarching story about a mysterious meteorite which lands in a small village and how the inhabitants react to it.  While the animation and art are relatively standard, the music adds a sense of life and energy to the short that makes it both a great start and one of the best in the package.The second short, ""Moondrive"", done by director of the Kill Bill anime sequence Kazuto Nakazawa, is a humorous tale of delinquents on a search for treasure on a colonized moon after they discover an indecipherable map.  The art style is a strange mix of Sylvian Chomet and Japanese conceptual art and gives the work a decrepit, yet comedic vibe.""Wanwa the Doggy"", by Shinya Ohira, who has previously done key animation on well-known Ghibi and Gainax works among others, continues the collection with a baby\'s vivid dream about pretty much everything a baby could experience.  It\'s one of the most imaginative in the package, featuring a simple chalk-based art style that makes the animation even more of a visual feast than it already is.""Toujin Kit"", my personal favorite short, is the story of a young girl under arrest for breeding mysterious squid-like organisms in a steampunkish/cyberpunkish world.  This short focuses more on narrative than the other works in the package, asking the viewer more questions than it does give answers, which serves to give the already intriguing world more depth.  Done by Tatsuyuki Tanaka, who has previously done key animation work on a variety of lesser-known works.The collaboration ends which the strangest of the bunch, key animation regular Koji Morimoto\'s 20-minute ""Dimension Bomb"".  It plays out like an unfocused dream about friendship and betrayal set in a strange quasi-postapocalyptic world that\'s one part Ergo Proxy and one part Texhnolyze.  This one, while narratively simple, is filled with enough unique and highly detailed steampunk, cyberpunk and sci-fi imagery to make it a fitting end to the collection. with an overarching story about a mysterious meteorite which lands in a small village and how the inhabitants react to it.

Gala - 82. Moondrive - 83. Wanwa the Puppy - 74. Tojin Kit - 85. Dimension Bomb - 9Unlike the first Genius Party where 3 of the shorts were bad and the other 4 were good, Genius Party Beyond doesn't have a single bad short. Wanwa the Puppy is the weakest of the shorts, mainly because the animation style can be a tad off putting at times, but it's still a good short. Gala, Moondrive and Tojin Kit are very good, but...the best short is Dimension Bomb. It's hard to put into words how great of a short it is, you simply have to experience it yourself and see what you think. Even though I felt like I wanted more than just 5 shorts (the first film had 7), I think Genius Party Beyond is a step up from it's predecessor.Overall Rating - 8 the best short is Dimension Bomb.

A unique premise about the marvels of life, for lack of better words. Good visuals, but nothing too spectacular. Also could've been shorter and nothing would've been lost.Moondrive - Good 8/10. Entertaining, Lupin III-esque action comedy. Has a plot. Fun cartoony animation style, memorable scratchy linework and backgrounds, decent number of actually funny jokes. Brought down a bit by its less funny sexism.Wanwa the Doggy - Okay 6/10. Really unique art style that kind of resembles Masaaki Yuasa's short in the first Genius Party. Little more than just a very long chase scene, but the abstract...backgrounds and technically impressive animation make it worthwhile, though not something I'd sit through twice.Toujin Kit - Great 9/10. Beautifully executed setting that keeps inviting you to ask question about the world. More resigned than other entries action wise, putting more energy into really fluid character acting. There's an actual plot, solid pacing. Monster design is genuinely other-worldly and is unlike anything I've seen before.Dimension Bomb - Bad 3/10. Beautiful character designs, backgrounds, and lighting work here. Animation is on par with other entries. 20 minute ambient music videos are not exactly engaging, though. The short uses almost impenetrably abstract storytelling, conveying its narrative through mostly-silent shots that drag on for years. The music itself is outright grating at times too.

Devilman: Tanjou-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2354/Devilman__Tanjou-hen,"['This is one of the first animes i ever saw and considering it’s themes it’s clear to me now that when I began my anime journey this anime in particular probably had a profound effect on my young mind for both good and bad reasons.StorylineAkira Fudou is your typical kind hearted high school student. He looks after cute little bunny rabbits while at school and has a nice girl friend (not dating) that he lives with since his parents are away on an excavation in the South Pole.One day while walking home from school Ryo, an old friend from Akira’s childhood turns up out of...the blue and demands that Akira follow him as he has something very important to discuss with him.After Akira agrees to hear him out Ryo starts to explain the horrifying details of what had recently become of his father who was a scientist.Ryo’s father seemed to have gone mad after investigating the existence of demons.At this point I should mention this first movie is somewot slow placed while the foundation of the story is being laid down. It’s a bit of a drag but stick with it as things start to spice up soon enough.Ryo takes Akira back to his father’s study where a lot of his research is being kept. Here Akira gets to actually SEE some of the crazy revelations Ryo’s father discovered.After that, all hell breaks loose…..why…because due to their snooping around with demon research / artefact’s, they get the attention of actual demons who start to chase them down.So after some more entertaining chase / demon encounters Ryo & Akira come to the realisation that the world will soon become exposed to the threat of a global demon outbreak…..so the question is what can they do to stop it…Well that’s the best part which I am not going to spoil for you…let’s just say it involves performing a certain ritual that involves alcohol, debauchery and violence.Since the name of this anime is Devilman it should be obvious at some point someone or something will become the Devilman….and no surprise to anyone who has seen the cover art who it’s going to be.So after DEVILMAN IS BORN true insanity ensues and Holy Shit the last 10 minutes of this anime is hardcore violence at its best.So yeah, in summary the first half of this anime is mostly explanation and build up for the last 15 minutes of pure awesomeness…..It was kinda worth the wait but sadly just after it starts getting really interesting its over……and at the time I watched this there was no way for me to know there was a part II so I was like Goddamn it I wanna know what happens next!Then luckily for me 2 weeks later (at the time 1993) on Channel 4 part two was broadcast….which I have also reviewedAnimationKeeping in mind this is late 80’s animation it is pretty decent…I mean the character designs look a bit cutesy at first but when the demons get involved things change quite dramatically.The standout thing for me in this movie is the strange opening sequence, the return to the strange opening sequence in the middle of the movie and the super gory action sequence at the end.Compared to today’s standards it’s not top notch but I feel it has still aged pretty well and is still very watchable.SoundI like the music in Devilman…its got a melancholy feel to it. The English dub is really quite comical to me but not in a bad way…I mean, re-watching this now I can understand why some people may find it korny but overall I think it works out very well. Devilman in particular say’s some really funny shite when he’s killing demons…certainly not the sweet boy Akira he was before.Overall sound is pretty decent…compared to the original Jap language it’s a bit spicier which worked out well enough in my opinionCharactersDevilman has an extremely small cast, which works in its favour. There’s pretty much Akira / Devilman, Ryo, Miki (barely) and the various demons Akira and Ryo have to face.For such a short anime I think the characters are developed well enough…In particular you get good foundation for Akira’s character which is the most important thing.EnjoymentI enjoy this anime on two levels, the first being nostalgia. I remember how confused and weird I felt about rooting for a demon to suceed…..this was way before the more recently accepted anti-hero boom we are surrounded by today.The second level is the action in this anime is pretty hardcore, animated decently, barebone and VERY enjoyable to watch.It’s a short fun crazy ride… I have enjoyed this title for many years and overall still find it of a high standard even after all these years.Value / Final ThoughtsOver time Demon protagonist’s have become more common place in movies (Hellboy) and especially in anime, to name a few: Hellsing, Vampire hunter D, Inu Yasha, the cast of Saiyuki, Chrono from Chrono Crusade etc. So Devilman kinda loses the anti-hero shock value it had around the original time it was made.But like I said before being very young and coming from a Christian upbringing in particular made this anime quite the shell-shocker.I was hesitant to write this review at first as I did feel a lot of my praise for it would come from nostalgia but after re-watching it I am now reassured it is actually a quality title that still holds up to this very dayIt’s short and sweet, thought provoking and many do hail it as a cult classic.Surprisingly though I found more reviews for this anime on IMDB that on various anime sites….however the manga is vastly more popular than the anime incarnations.Planet Tyro Rating: Solid BDevilman Franchise Blog:  http://bit.ly/157LdCGplanettyro.com the blue and demands that Akira follow him as he has something very important to discuss with him.After Akira agrees to hear him out Ryo starts to explain the horrifying details of what had recently become of his father who was a scientist.Ryo’s father seemed to have gone mad after investigating the existence of demons.At this point I should mention this first movie is somewot slow placed while the foundation of the story is being laid down.

Here Akira gets to actually SEE some of the crazy revelations Ryo’s father discovered.After that, all hell breaks loose…..why…because due to their snooping around with demon research / artefact’s, they get the attention of actual demons who start to chase them down.So after some more entertaining chase / demon encounters Ryo & Akira come to the realisation that the world will soon become exposed to the threat of a global demon outbreak…..so the question is what can they do to stop it…Well that’s the best part which I am not going to spoil for you…let’s just say it involves performing a certain ritual that involves alcohol, debauchery and violence.Since the name of this anime is Devilman it should be obvious at some point someone or something will become the Devilman….and no surprise to anyone who has seen the cover art who it’s going to be.So after DEVILMAN IS BORN true insanity ensues and Holy Shit the last 10 minutes of this anime is hardcore violence at its best.So yeah, in summary the first half of this anime is mostly explanation and build up for the last 15 minutes of pure awesomeness…..It was kinda worth the wait but sadly just after it starts getting really interesting its over……and at the time I watched this there was no way for me to know there was a part II so I was like Goddamn it I wanna know what happens next!Then luckily for me 2 weeks later (at the time 1993) on Channel 4 part two was broadcast….which I have also reviewedAnimationKeeping in mind this is late 80’s animation it is pretty decent…I mean the character designs look a bit cutesy at first but when the demons get involved things change quite dramatically.The standout thing for me in this movie is the strange opening sequence, the return to the strange opening sequence in the middle of the movie and the super gory action sequence at the end.Compared to today’s standards it’s not top notch but I feel it has still aged pretty well and is still very watchable.SoundI like the music in Devilman…its got a melancholy feel to it. The English dub is really quite comical to me but not in a bad way…I mean, re-watching this now I can understand why some people may find it korny but overall I think it works out very well. Devilman in particular say’s some really funny shite when he’s killing demons…certainly not the sweet boy Akira he was before.Overall sound is pretty decent…compared to the original Jap language it’s a bit spicier which worked out well enough in my opinionCharactersDevilman has an extremely small cast, which works in its favour. There’s pretty much Akira / Devilman, Ryo, Miki (barely) and the various demons Akira and Ryo have to face.For such a short anime I think the characters are developed well enough…In particular you get good foundation for Akira’s character which is the most important thing.EnjoymentI enjoy this anime on two levels, the first being nostalgia. I remember how confused and weird I felt about rooting for a demon to suceed…..this was way before the more recently accepted anti-hero boom we are surrounded by today.The second level is the action in this anime is pretty hardcore, animated decently, barebone and VERY enjoyable to watch.It’s a short fun crazy ride… I have enjoyed this title for many years and overall still find it of a high standard even after all these years.Value / Final ThoughtsOver time Demon protagonist’s have become more common place in movies (Hellboy) and especially in anime, to name a few: Hellsing, Vampire hunter D, Inu Yasha, the cast of Saiyuki, Chrono from Chrono Crusade etc. So Devilman kinda loses the anti-hero shock value it had around the original time it was made.But like I said before being very young and coming from a Christian upbringing in particular made this anime quite the shell-shocker.I was hesitant to write this review at first as I did feel a lot of my praise for it would come from nostalgia but after re-watching it I am now reassured it is actually a quality title that still holds up to this very dayIt’s short and sweet, thought provoking and many do hail it as a cult classic.Surprisingly though I found more reviews for this anime on IMDB that on various anime sites….however the manga is vastly more popular than the anime incarnations.Planet Tyro Rating: Solid BDevilman Franchise Blog:  http://bit.ly/157LdCGplanettyro.com', ""For any fan of the recent Anime Devilman Crybaby and wondered if you should give this OVA a try, this review is for you. At this point, you’ve probably seen a couple “Devilman dub is gold” or “Devilman dub is a treasure.” The sheer quirkiness of some of the dialogue has made these videos become incredibly popular. After it being brought to your attention, you might wonder is Devilman: Tanjou-hen worth watching?Story (5/10)The story of Devilman: Tanjou-hen (also known as Devilman: The Birth) is much the same of the devilman you already know. Akira, young weak boy meets up with his good friend Ryo. Ryo...tells him about the existence of devils, turns him into devilman. We all know this basic plot, it’s the premise of Devilman Crybaby, but it’s the summary of Devilman: Tanjou-hen.  In Crybaby, there was plenty of time to go beyond the basic premise and tell the story, Tanjou-hen on the other hand seems to act more of a prequel. Of course, it is important to note that Tanjou-hen has a sequel, but rating it on it’s own values shows that the plot is shallow.Furthermore, the entire OVA, save for the last fifteen minutes, serves as buildup for the OVA, but never managing to go further than the premise. The pacing of the OVA suffers because of this fact, too long when there is no action and right when the OVA gets to a part with high intensity it ends.Speaking of the pacing, there are some real weird moments of Akira and Ryo just standing and staring at each other. Not an intense mid battle stare, just standing there. There came a point where it became uncomfortable as a viewer as it seemed that the stare passed the ten second mark, which is an awful long time to stare.Of course, the story that it does include is well done and enjoyable. The story does not gain praise nor scorn. It’s mediocre at best.TLDR: Not much to speak of on the story, the premise of Devilman is what you get and no further. Pacing issues.Art (7/10)It’s always hard for an old anime to age well, and especially looking in the retrospective it is easy to be critical of art. That being said, I will try my best to put bias aside and give a fair review.The art for this OVA was good. The landscapes at the beginning are nice, albeit run of the mill. I think where the art shines through is when the characters faces are drawn. There are some very quirky lines in Tanjou-hen and the visuals accompany it. While I’m sure that people will say that the lines are bad, and therefore so are the visuals, it is important to remember: regardless of what you thought of the lines the art did a good job representing it. One of the notable, yet unimportant, characters of the show was the goofy gangster. His movements and facial expressions mimicked how his character was weird and mocking. Even Akira’s facial expressions were very good in more comedic moments. The monsters were creative and interesting. What I think took away some of the points that the art earned was again the weird stare downs. When flashing between two characters faces with no change in expression, it is hard to get new information.TLDR: Nice art for the time, landscape was run of the mill, but the characters motions and facial expressions shined through. But again the weird stare downs were a problem for me.Sound (6/10)There were few times when I actually noticed the sound/music in the OVA, but that wasn’t a bad thing. It fit the show well, but it didn’t hold any particular impact for me. There were moments that I would hear soft creepy music playing in the OVA (there is a lot of that type of music) and would think, that’s nice. It didn’t distract me from the show, but it definitely added to the experience, even if in a minor way.TLDR: It was Fine.Character (7/10)The characters of Devilman are iconic, and while Tenjou-hen misses some of the nuances that might have been there in another adaptation, it still nails these fun characters on the surface. Akira is still weak and Ryo is still an asshole, but each has a bit of humor attached to them. Akira’s desire to escape situations, disbelief, and awkwardness that  lead to the comedy in his actions and reactions. For Ryo, it’s his dry nature and sarcasm that carries the moedy.TLDR: No nuance, but fun characterization with humor.Enjoyment (8/10)I truly think that enjoyment is the most important category for this show in particular, especially if you are tempted to watch this show after watching a youtube video or two on the dub. I personally watched the dub, because of the youtube videos I watched as well as that was the method that was most accessible to me. I think watching this is a bit similar to Ghost Stories as there is no genuine reason why it's good, but you enjoy it nonetheless and you can’t say the dub isn’t entertaining. If you’re willing to watch a whole fifty minutes worth of an OVA to catch ever nugget of gold in the dub, to listen to every single casually dropped curse word, then this OVA is for you. If after watching a single youtube video, you think had enough of Tanjou-hen, then I wouldn’t go on to watch the entire OVA.TLDR: The quotes from this show make it so enjoyableOverall (7/10)The OVA was something good and incredibly enjoyable for me, but was nothing spectacular. If you are wanting to watch the OVA in a serious fashion, I don’t particularly recommend it since that is not the part of it I enjoyed the most. If you are looking for laughable moments in an otherwise serious series and don’t mind spending 50 minutes to further immerse yourself in the world of Devilman and some of the memes behind it, then go for it, the OVA is for you.TLDR: If you’re in for a fun time, go for it. Don’t expect anything too serious or phenomenal. tells him about the existence of devils, turns him into devilman.

While the film adds and subtractsa tad bit of scenes, it is as if many of the panels and dialogue from the first volume of Devilman are literally animated onto the screen. The animation is a little wonky at times but is overall, very good for 1987. And true to Go ""My Father Died"" Nagai\'s work the film is sort of awkward and the dialogue is down right...bizarre at times. However, it still manages to create that depraved, trippy, unnatural atmosphere that colorizes Nagai\'s horror manga. bizarre at times.

The story itself to me was quite interesting  ( although the 1st 5 min or so with the demonic slaughter intro made me a bit wondering), it was´nt too complex luckely, though it really started to be very dark for me .Animationwise it´s sooo 80´s u can´t miss it with some faults here and there as usual but at parts well made, i like handmade anime its just how u look at it today.Furtheron in the story after some gruesome scene´s  some  Makai ( demons) turn up to  silence the two protagonists and at that point the late 80´s tracks start to kick off, but only for  moment, moving on to the last 15 min of the ova. After seeing some good action scene´s and saw the explenation of the story, i remember the bit in the rockdisco where a socalled´ ritual  supposed to be held , and that one of the two protagonists wanted to start to kicking it off by slashing everybody for a certain reason ( no i´m not gonna spoil THAT much) and well.... the violence was soo damn filty, soo much red and soo much brutal demonslaughter i almost choked out for a minute and was totally scared afterwards, i hardly slept . i had had first some sort of filthy disgust against akira ( the main person) because WHY had he killed those demons so  brutal and inhumane, but seeing the 2nd ova part even how sickminded and terrified i was i understood part of why he turned into a sickening demon, together with the ova series and short movie wich came years later, that are overall softer somewhat. but man oh man did i had a harsh time with ths one, thumbs up Violence Jack that was some sort of culthits among older animefans like this one .

The big question is ""How\'s the OVA\'s?"" The answer? ""Eh?""This OVA takes basically the first part of the manga where our wimpy hero becomes the hero that Japan deserves, Devilman, and drags it out ad nauseum. Crybaby had the right idea condensing the part this OVA adapts to a single 20 minute episode, because its littered with boring exposition and flashbacks that you are likely to skip. Despite the lengthy runtime, we don\'t get a whole lot of development from our main characters, much less side characters like Miki, who were absolutely spoiled in...the Crybaby adaptationHowever, the presentation is actually pretty good. Action scenes are smooth and have surprisingly good impact and it still looks really good despite being from 1987. Not to mention the delicious amount of gore. This is the 80\'s after all.If you are to watch this, watch the dub, because the excessive swearing and one-liners is what most of the enjoyment of this otherwise mediocre late 80s slugfest comes from. However, when the characters aren\'t being more hammy than a Boar\'s Head, particularly during parts with exposition or parts where the plot is making an attempt to be serious, the delivery is quite wooden. At these points, the Japanese dub is actually much better, and some parts where the dub overdid it, such as the ""I\'M DEVILMAAAAAAAAAN"" scene, the original actually sounds really cool. But the original language, without the swearing and overacting, just makes the underdeveloped characters and plot in this simultaneously bloated and thin OVA more obvious.So just pop a cold one, turn your brain off, and enjoy the condensed 80s in this pretty fun romp. the Crybaby adaptationHowever, the presentation is actually pretty good.

Sure the original TV series existed, but it went on a different path than the manga. However in 1987, we finally saw an OVA that promised us to follow more closely to the manga.Was it any good? Well, it depends on how you watch it. If you watch it with knowing what Devilman is about, then you have an interesting and entertaining adaptation. But if you watch it as an introduction to Devilman, it might just be an introduction and nothing that special.Unlike Fist of the North Star...the movie and Macross: Do you remember Love which not only introduces itself but also retold the story, Devilman directly following what was shown in the first chapters with no real finally. Then again, those two where movies who had to summarize several episodes under two hours, while this was just one OVA in less than an hour. Hell this OVA is called “The Birth”, so you can’t expect much than an origin story.But I digress.This OVA dumps allot of exposition. Which would be good if there WAS more than just two OVAs created. Yes, this is one of those OVAs where it’s only two episodes. So you should probably see this as long episode rather than anything else.Because of this, the OVA sets up a decent atmosphere of both Horror and Suspense as demons can pop up at any moment. It helps as Akira has to man up and fight back. The story might be not as good as it could had been, it still presents what we should know and it does it well. Some people might say that this is played way too fast as this takes place during one afternoon. But considering the extremes Akira faces and how they are pushing him to a corner, you can’t really blame it.As you might expected, this movie has a good enough of gore. It’s that type of 80’s gore that everyone likes. Uncensored, but not polished.If I had to compare this to the source material, this isn't as crazy or humours and makes the situation look darker than what it was originally portrayed. But I think it’s decent as this tries much to contrast to the TV-series.And you can tell by its design. The design is spot on. When I think of Devilman, this is the version I think off. Not that the TV-series was bad, but since this adaptation demanded a menacing look, this is the closest version to match the manga. The characters themselves are fun to watch, with Akira trying to be reasonable and Ryo who is an extremist. Too bad they won’t leave much of an impression unless you know who these characters are. The voice casting is good, exactly what I would think when I hear these characters. Akira is voiced by Zarbon, which actually is fitting when you think about it.But for the LOVE OF GOD, don’t expect the same quality for the English dub. Let me just say that they might missed the point that these characters aren't delinquents with foal mouths.So if you ever wanted to get into Devilman but can’t find the first chapters, this is the way to start. If you feel like that this one didn't hooked you up, then the next one will defiantly help you out. the movie and Macross: Do you remember Love which not only introduces itself but also retold the story, Devilman directly following what was shown in the first chapters with no real finally.

Sadly, despite both of the OVA installments being absolutely stunning, Miki Makimura doesn\'t get as much of a presence as I would have liked. In ""The Birth"", she\'s just the kind-hearted girl in the scenario and in ""The Demon Bird"", she\'s more of a glorified fanservice spectacle, though her presence does have an interesting purpose in the groundwork for that installment!Masaaki\'s ""Crybaby"" replicates the Satanic sacrifice disco (with 200% more LSD in the mixture), but I still found the scene in ""The Birth"" OVA to be more poignant and gripping... especially, since there is the scene at the end where the bereaved Akira has transformed back into a mortal and is cradling Ryō\'s lifeless body! The first OVA also does a really great job at making Ryō appear as both a horrible psychopath, which is used to foreshadow later events, and also invokes sympathy, because his father was deeply submerged in the deepest darkness.While I prefer ""The Demon Bird"" for a variety of reasons, the likes of which I\'ll explain in that review, ""The Birth"" is one of the best ""origin story"" animations that I have ever seen. The shot composition is genius in the way that it flops between the demon realm and the human world, to ultimately have Akira struggle with his own inner-demons! Much like Marvel\'s ""Spider-Man"" — Akira Fudō is less of a grandiose superhero and more of a person that gets thrown into the fray, and has to constantly struggle to salvage his humanity out of a pit of constant turmoil and trauma!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Umanosuke Iida (director), notable works:* CB Chara Go Nagai World ✅* Devilman: Yochō Sirene-hen ✅* Hellsing (2001) ✅* Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team (eps 6 to 11) ✅* Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team — Miller\'s Report* Tide-Line Blue* Towa no Quon 1: Utakata no KabenCommentary: Brilliant director, Mr. Iida had a real eye for saturating colors together and has used color theory to his advantage throughout his filmography.

He IS Devilman to me! He has such a powerful, masculine voice! I would compare his performance as Akira Fudō to his roles in ""Boku no Chikyū wo Mamotte"" (""Please Save My Earth"") as Shion and in ""Trigun"" as Nicholas D. Wolfwood! Truth be told, he was my favorite actor in ""Serial Experiments Lain"" — his performance as the megalomaniacal, Masami Eiri, is both horrifying and the peak of excellence!

He has a very commanding presence; so much so, that I ended up paying more attention to his character in ""Creamy Mami"" than to the lead love interest! I would compare his performance as Ryō Asuka to his characterizations of Toshio Ōtomo (in the aforementioned ""Creamy Mami"") and Clow Reed (""Tsubasa Chronicles""), both are more of his bishōnen-archetype roles! Great job!Jun Kōyamaki as Miki Makimura, notable roles:* noneCommentary: Ms. Kōyamaki isn\'t credited to any other anime role, that I could find, but she has acted in live action roles (under the stage name: ""Makoto Sumikawa""). I have conflicting information on whether she was Marina in ""Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime"" or not — some sources have Ms. Kōyamaki credited in the role and others have Fumie Kashiyama listed. She is known for her live action roles in shows like ""Kamen Rider Black RX"" and ""Jikū Senshi Spielban"" — her career was more centered around television dramas, with a foot slightly dipped into the anime pool. Her version of Miki Makimura is the best, in my opinion, she gives off the aura of a wholesome, everyday girl... this characterization of Miki even reminded me of some of the pure-spirited Ghibli girls, like Nausicaä. Great job, it\'s a shame that she didn\'t get a chance to voice in more anime productions!Conclusively, ""The Birth"" straddles the line between corporeal existence and the otherworldly. For anyone itching to get into the Devilman franchise — I would NOT suggest ""Crybaby"" but instead, would recommend ""The Birth"" to get you started! It gives a really solid introduction to Akira Fudō, Ryō Asuka, and Miki Makimura — and it is also a treat for the eyes! You can probably tell from my passionate diatribe that I\'m going to rank ""The Birth"" a 7/10, it is truly emotionally captivating and stunning in its delivery!Rating: ★★★★☆ wake of the prehistoric era! And then that plot device, gets shown later, when the blithely naïve Akira Fudō gets chided into putting on an ancient relic (it makes me wonder if the character ""Frank"" from ""Donnie Darko"" was inspired by the demon relic\'s design)! And then the audience is tour de force\'d into watching a group of angelic beings being brutally ripped apart.

This OVA talks about the conflict between humans and demons and how the only way to confront demons is to become a demon because humans, no matter how advanced their weapons are. You will not be a strong enemie for demons, as Ryo explained to Akira in their conversation. Personally, this is the first work related to Devil Man i have watched , but I have some information about the series and some things have been spoilet to me🔴The beginningThis OVA begins with a scene that shows a fight between demons and it seems that in ancient times, this fight shows you from the start how brutal the demons are even between each other. As for the characters, we have seen a scene where MC Akira Fudo appears while he finds his rabbits he takes care of appearing in horror, the way he holds him on his chest and holds them reflects his cute personality. He is also social and has a girlfriend. And when Ryo comes to take Akira with him, his girlfriend intervenes, but Ryo takes out a knife, which reflects his aggressive personality, and the way he walks reflects his indifferent personality as well. And in my opinion, this presentation was excellent 👌🔵 Ryo and Akira friendshipFor me the friendship of the main characters who make up a team is good when these characters complement each other. A simple example from the work of another friendship Mob and Reagan. Mob needs Regin as a teacher and Regin needs Mob to continue his career. So let's see is Ryo and Akira good friendship? Ryo needs to fight demons to avenge his father and we saw that the way they would adopt is that the devil can defeat the rest, but in order for a mortal to control the power of the devil to transform, he must be a person with a pure heart and a sense of justice and these are the characteristics of Akira .For Akira, Ryo was just an old friend from the beginning but there was a reason why he continued his friendship with Ryo after the danger increased, and we see that he knew that demons killed his parents and this was one of the reasons why he continued with Ryo's plan. Ryo also tells Akira that the demons will return to take back Earth, which is all the more reason for them to continue🟠 Animation and sound effectsThis aspect was excellent even though this OVA is old. The sound effects and scenes of bloody ruptures were extremely accurate. And the way Ryo and Akira were drawn to reflect their personalities in some scenes, this is something we don't see in some other anime.🔺️ Conclusion 🔺️The first Devil Man OVA is very special. I haven't seen the Crybaby version, but people prefer it. According to what I saw, no scenes suggesting homosexuality have yet appearedThe reason I rate it with 9/10 is that I am actually waiting for the twists I expect to appear in the second OVA, and if they appear, it would not be fair to give them the same rating, and Akira's evolution is not over yet .And maybe for some nude drawings but it was really ugly and didn't excite anyone lol . يبدو أنه في زمن قديم ، و هذا القتال يريك منذ البداية كمية وحشية الشياطين حتى بين بعضها البعض . اما الشخصيات فرأينا مشهد يظهر فيه البطل اكيرا فودو و هو يجد ارانبه التي يعتني بها قد قتلت الا واحد كان في حالة رعب و طريقة ضمه الى صدره و امساكه بالأرنب تعكس شخصيته اللطيفة و بعد مهاجتمه من قبل الجانحين ظل ممسكاً بالأرنب ما يجعلنا نرى حس اكيرا بالعدالة و لا ننسى وجود حبيبة له ما يرينا انه ايضاً إجتماعي . اما الشخصية الرئيسية الأخرى ريو فظهر و هو يطلب من اكيرا المجيء معه و عند تدخل حبيبة اكيرا اخر سكين و هددها فيه ما يعكس شخصيته العدوانية و طريقة مشيّه التي تبدي عدم الإهتمام الا بما جاء لأجلهو برأي هذا التقديم كان ممتاز 👌🔵 علاقة ريو و اكيرابالنسبة لي علاقة الشخصيات الرئيسية التي تشكل فريق تكون جيدة عندما تكون هذه الشخصيات تكمل بعضها . مثال بسيط من عمل اخر علاقة موب و ريغن بإختصار موب يحتاج لريغين كمعلم و ريغين يحتاج موب لمواصلة مهنته . فدعنا نرى هل علاقة ريو و اكيرا جيدة؟ريو يحتاج محاربة الشياطين إنتقاماً لوالده ووضحنا أن الطريقة الذي سيعتمدونها هي أن الشيطان يستطيع هزيمة الباقي و لكن لكي يستطيع البشري السيطرة على قوة الشيطان ان يتحول يجب أن يكون شخصاً ذو قلب نقي و لديه حس بالعدالة و هذه صفات اكيراو بالنسبة لأكيرا فكان ريو مجرد صديق قديم منذ البداية و بسبب شخصيته الطيبة اراد مساعدته لكن بعد أن اشتد الخطر ما جعله يستمر هو ادراكه أن المخلوقات التي قتلت ابواه هي شياطين بعد أن صدق وجودها و إنتقاماً لهما أستمر بمساعدة ريو . و تم اخبر ريو اكيرا ايضاً ان الشياطين ستعود لإستعادة الأرض و هذا سبب إضافي لإستمرارهما🟠 الإنتاججيد جداً بالنسبة لي و لا اقول هذا بسبب سنة الإنتاج بل هو فعلاً جيد المشاهد الدموية و المؤثرات الصوتية تدخلك الجوّ و الإهتمام بالتفاصيل في داخل الأجساد المقطعة و تمزق الثياب رهيب و رسم الملامح في المشاهد التي تجمع ريو و اكيرا تعكس شخصيتهما خصوصاً العيون و هذا جانب لا يبدع فيه الأعمال الا القليل🔺️ خاتمة 🔺️اوفا ديفل مان الأولى مميزة جداً . لم اشاهد نسخة كراي بيبي لكن الناس تفضلها عليه حسب ما رأيت و لم يظهر حتى الأن أي مشهد يوحي بالشذوذسبب تقييمي لها بتسعة هو أني فعلياً انتظر تويستات اتوقع تظهر في الأوفا الثانية و اذا ظهرت لن يكون من العدل إعطائهما نفس التقييم ، و تطور اكيرا لم ينتهي بعدو ربما بعض الرسومات العارية لكن كانت بشعة فعلياً و لا تثير أي شخص لول🔻Devil Man ova 1 review 🔻(devilman: the birth)Devil Man is one of the ancient and influential Japanese works on the industry by its author Go Nagai, author of Grendizer and Mazinger and several other works.

I say this because this is easiest the best Go Nagai adaptation without deviating or doing seemingly weird changes which Devilman anime suffered the most from. It changes some things to be more 80's and it pretty much works. The only thing common in Devilman adaptation is that the soundtrack kicks ASS!

Just the line delivery is so over the top that it carries the movie. The pacing is actually pretty decent tho but that probably due to short running time.  A lot of things bugged me tho like how the music never fit any of the scenes. I had a hard time telling if a scene was supposed to be scary, badass, funny, or sad because all the music cant empahaise anything and when it can the voice acting ruined it. The characters were kinda forgettable and the story was really...basic. There wasent a lot here but damn this movie is entertaining for all the wrong reasons. basic.

Ryu tell akira about how his father commited suicide when he was driven to madness due to a strange demonic artifact and his research into the demonic realm.Akira then learns about the demons past and how they...intend to take over the world once again and that the only way to fight a demon is with a merger of human and demon in order to acquire the demons powers.Ryo tells akira that for a demon to posses a human without the human being taken over by it ,the person must be pure of heart and that akira is the perfect choice.And so the two put in place the retual for demons merger but can they fuse with the demons without being controlled themselves ?.Develman isnt for everyone,those that like a more deep and complex plot wont be able to appreciate this as it is pretty straightforward.The animation carried an  eighties charm that I really liked but younger viewers probably wont.There was some nice dose of violence and gore along with some unintentional humour from the diologue.Overall quite entertaining. intend to take over the world once again and that the only way to fight a demon is with a merger of human and demon in order to acquire the demons powers.Ryo tells akira that for a demon to posses a human without the human being taken over by it ,the person must be pure of heart and that akira is the perfect choice.And so the two put in place the retual for demons merger but can they fuse with the demons without being controlled themselves ?.Develman isnt for everyone,those that like a more deep and complex plot wont be able to appreciate this as it is pretty straightforward.The animation carried an  eighties charm that I really liked but younger viewers probably wont.There was some nice dose of violence and gore along with some unintentional humour from the diologue.Overall quite entertaining."", ""This OVA is faithful to the manga and features plenty of bloody demon fight scenes, male and female nudity, and enough gore to fill a dump truck. Although the show has some rough spots and unsettling writing at the beginning, it ended up being better than expected, at least among gory action movies.Devilman begins slowly with tension building, but the first episode lacks substance until the end. In terms of the storyline, the episode mishandles Akira's moral dilemma. It is tragic to merge with a demon to save the Earth, but the chosen method is completely out of character. Despite a slow start, the movie...quickly gains momentum with a lot of action and interesting characters. Go Nagai's talent for creating sympathetic characters, especially in gory movies, is showcased. Although there is not much of a story, the abundance of thrilling events makes up for it.Devilman manages to keep the action exciting and engaging, and even during the fights, the hero's effort is palpable. The horror movie-inspired suspense scenes are particularly effective, and though not truly scary, they create a sense of tension that I did not expect. I found myself actually caring about the outcome of the fights, and it was a rare instance where I felt attached enough to the hero in ultraviolent anime.Regarding the gore, and given that this is an older splatterfest series, the action is notably superior to the average - there's a lot of it and not much of the cheap animation cop-outs or still-frames. The fight choreography is fast and surprisingly interesting, and there are even a few creative moments, such as the way that the superhuman fighters navigate normal homes. Some of the strange things that possessed household objects do are also effectively unsettling. The gore in the series is also better than most. The flying blood and viscera are executed with great detail and relish and are even worthy of merit, with a touch of artistic flair. Similarly, a couple of long scenes of prehistoric life during demon-infested times stand out as bizarre but creative in a sick-nature-show sort of way.The music, a less memorable soundtrack by Kenji Kawai, is sparse and on par with other older OAVs: orchestral but overblown.Overall, Devilman doesn't transcend its demon-splatterfest roots, but within this genre, it is surprisingly well-executed. It has enough creativity to keep even the more discerning viewers interested and doesn't show its age; it's vintage animation that can hold its own with anything new. However, if you're not a fan of gore and action, this series is definitely not for you.

This OVA is somehow both worse and better than Crybaby at the same time, and I\'ll explain how. First of all the artwork/animation is actually quite good. Despite being made in the late 80\'s the anime still looks good today because the character designs are very detailed, unlike the 2018 Crybaby. Unfortunately, BECAUSE the art is more detailed, when something very violent/gory happens it makes you sick to your stomach, more so than Crybaby made you feel with its lack of detail in the...art. I also need to mention how much animal violence is in this anime: several cute bunnies are mutilated by school bullies and Ryo\'s poor dog is brutally beheaded by his mad father, and both scenes are for shock value. As an animal lover myself I hated this anime for those 2 scenes alone.This first OVA basically stretches out Crybaby\'s 1st episode to an hour in length. Not much happens storywise in this OVA aside from giving some much-needed backstory about the demon world (which was absent from Crybaby) as well as details about Ryo\'s family and how Akira becomes Devilman for the first time. I like how this anime stays focused on the important stuff and doesn\'t waste your time with track and field stars, ""passing the baton,"" random weird rappers, etc.In terms of characters, some are more developed, while others are even less developed. For instance Miki is even less developed than her Crybaby version, barely getting any screen time at all. We learn a little more about Ryo here, as we start to feel a little bad for him after seeing all of the crazy stuff he dealt with his dad trying to murder him and killing his dog. Still, it\'s not long before Ryo goes full-asshole, threatening Miki with a knife just to get her to stop following them?! Next thing you know he\'s murdering people in that nightclub just to test a theory about demons. When the victimized dancers try to kill Ryo in retaliation and Akira stops them, you find yourself asking, ""Why? Why not let them do it?"" I\'ll say this: Akira Fudo is MUCH better here than his Crybaby version! In Crybaby it was so rushed that we barely got to know Akira before he gets possessed by Amon, but in Devilman: The Birth we take our time with this character and he only gets taken over by the demon at the very end. I MUCH prefer this approach to the way Crybaby did it. Instead of simply telling you over and over what a good person Akira is, this version of the anime actually has a scene SHOWING you he\'s a good person! Imagine that! Here we see how distraught Akira is upon finding the dead bunnies, and he literally puts his life on the line to protect the sole remaining bunny from bloodthirsty bullies. I actually like this Akira so far, and I hope they continue to make him a likable protagonist in the next two OVA\'s.Overall, I\'d say if you can stomach the animal violence this anime is OK, 6/10. Not great by any means, but part 1 is certainly watchable and preferable to Crybaby. Now let\'s see how they handled Devilman parts 2 and 3... art.

Phoenix Wright talking to Detective Gumshoe while Maya is searching around and messing with some stuff). this is an important and crucial thing that the first (thou-shalt-not-be-remembered) season missed the mark on... but this season DID! so... yey!Can\'t wait to see if Ace Attorney anime redeems itself! <38/10 that happens whenever an investigation-thingy happens (ex.

Having gained the independence to make their own decisions and not simply be A-1\'s B-studio, they might have been able to take the series in a new direction. And with PVs showing revamped character designs, and the fact that this season was to adapt only one game (Trials & Tribulations, the third game in the series), and the show even starting with a good first episode, things were starting to look hopeful.Sadly, this was not to be.If you\'ve...read my review of the first season, you\'ll see I\'ve already detailed there what a disaster this anime was from a technical perspective. There are some improvements to be found here - the colour palette for the character designs was improved from the undersaturated tones used in the season prior, although the facial proportions are still odd. The courtroom has also been revamped to something more closely resembling that of the games (although the defence and prosecution are still on the wrong sides of the court for some reason). Most importantly though, the CG court gallery, whilst not removed outright, has been made much less obvious. This anime even looks good at times - but it\'s extremely uneven. In some episodes it looks completely fine, but in many more there are constant and severe animation errors. The animation may be slightly improved, but it needed much more than ""slight"" improvements.As before, this takes a streamlined approach to the games, cutting a lot of incidental dialogue. This actually works wonders for its opening case, The Lost Turnabout. This was originally the first case of the second game, Justice For All, which was left out of the first season - Understandably so, as it serves mostly to reintroduce the main cast, which would have been quite out of place in the middle of the previous season. That case has some fun contradictions, all of which are preserved here (for once), but it suffered from having an extremely irritating main villain whose main characteristic was rambling and ranting. The streamlining of dialogue cuts this out, leaving a much more enjoyable case as a result.However, this approach is detrimental to the entire rest of the anime. In particular this damages the characterisation of two of its most central characters - Godot and Mia Fey. Godot serves as the primary antagonist for this season, a mysterious masked man with a grudge against Phoenix. While Godot is probably the least capable rival Phoenix has ever had in the games, notable more for his characterisation than presenting a direct threat, he was still a competent prosecutor in the source material. Here, however, he fails to present a single decent argument.And Mia Fey comes off even worse. Prior to Trials & Tribulations/Gyakuten Saiban 3, she had been a mostly one-dimensional character, having been killed off quite early on and serving more as a ghost mentor figure to Phoenix and a part of various character\'s backstories. Here, however, we are treated to two cases set before the start of the series in which Mia Fey is the protagonist. Sadly she doesn\'t differ much from Phoenix in this adaptation, as both were strongly characterised by their inner monologue - the game\'s version of Mia is the sassiest thing on the planet, but that is completely absent here. Similarly, the anime totally changes the romantic dynamic she had with her mentor, making her obviously flustered in place of the more subtle dialogue that was used originally. It\'s a clear downgrade, and takes her even further away from her excellent game counterpart.Those two cases are adapted more faithfully than much of the game - presumably since as they are more closely linked with this series\' overarching plot. However while the events themselves aren\'t changed much, the sequencing of the cases is bafflingly rearranged. Turnabout Memories, originally the first case of the game most of this season is from, is moved to around the midway point, directly before the other prequel case, Turnabout Beginnings. Given that the plot threads set up in this case are vital to the dramatic core of this entire arc, and help to build intrigue in some of the later cases moved before it, this rearranging of the cases damages the narrative somewhat. While it isn\'t devastating, it\'s still maddening that they would arbitrarily make such an easily-avoided misstep.A similarly bizarre decision was to add an entire four episodes of filler (including a brand new anime-original case, Turnabout Express) when such a substantial amount of canon content was trimmed out. Save for the aforementioned Lost Turnabout there isn\'t a single case here that couldn\'t have used more runtime. Somehow, even the filler case manages to feel rushed, and wastes some ideas that might honestly have made a good case (although possessing some obvious flaws, like the killer\'s identity being one of the franchise\' most outplayed tropes).Fortunately the series does make a significant jump in quality in its second half. Turnabout Beginnings in particular manages to preserve if not outright improve on the eerie tone it sets, with its very premise spelling certain doom for most people involved. Even the animation here is noticeably better than usual, and many of the presentation choices in these episodes do a superb job of emphasizing some of its most key emotional beats.Most importantly of all, though, this season adapts Bridge to the Turnabout, the indisputable masterpiece of the original Ace Attorney trilogy, if not the entire franchise - and manages to not completely bastardize it. While it does make some errors in its first half (in particular bungling the initial hook of the case), in its second half it fares far better, not only giving the events the due space to breathe properly, but also featuring some uncharacteristically excellent directing in places. This case is an absolute masterpiece of detective fiction, managing to create an incredibly layered mystery that weaves together an absurd amount of narrative threads so perfect a puzzle that it defies belief. It creates a perfect mystery while also managing the feat of tying it all into numerous threads laid throughout both of the previous games, and grounding it into the conclusion of compelling character arcs for much of the main cast. It really cannot be overstated just how good Bridge to the Turnabout is, even if the execution here is flawed in places.Overall this season is a significant improvement over its predecessor, but it\'s really too little, too late. While the production is better than its predecessor (what isn\'t?), the improvement is owed more to having better source material than the previous season.If you have not played the games, and have already watched the first season, I am begging you not to watch this one. Please go play the games instead. They are available on so many consoles at this point that there\'s no way you don\'t have something that can access it.Story/Plot: 6/10Characters: 5/10Animation/Art: 3/10Sound: 5/10Overall: 5/10For Fans Of: Detective Conan, Umineko no Naku Koro Ni read my review of the first season, you\'ll see I\'ve already detailed there what a disaster this anime was from a technical perspective.

Rough work on the pacing, narration and execution was detrimental to the final work. However, CloverWorks worked on some of the core problems the prequel had and it brought forth a much acceptable result.The theme of the anime remains pretty much the same with Phoenix (Naruhodo) going through a few cases, but this time there is much more attention to the pacing, leaving enough time for a case to unfold in a more natural way than rush through everything. There were 23 episodes to animate only...1 game, which meant there was plenty of time for everything and indeed, they gave the final case the space it needed which made the series shine in the end with some great moments and a most well done climax, unlike the prequel.Of course, this does not make everything great, as things still may be fast and there are various fillers that are just really boring (albeit some being on point!), but the changes have been welcome and it makes the experience much better for people who may have not played the games. It is still pretty far away from a perfect narration of a mystery (but that is not really the anime’s fault), but combined with the intricate story the 3rd game has, which involves our main characters deeply and has a span of many years, and the better storytelling, we have a series we can at least be happy about this time.Character-wise, there is not much change other than the inclusion of Godot, who is by far the best character in the franchise, and Dahlia (Chinami), who is surprisingly very good at what she does. The downside of the characters is that the franchise itself is peculiar in ways that just do not make sense with characters acting so unnaturally sometimes, ignoring the obvious thing or somehow making the most absurd (yet right) assumptions, etc, so this happens in this series as well. It all comes down to how much you can like them and ignore such things, but of course it is not a good thing either way. Thankfully, there is a touching story involving a lot of characters this time and the more we learn, the better it gets.Unfortunately, the art and animation have a lot of problems to the point that even in some close-up stills, the anatomy is pretty terrible which is astounding. I still consider it an upgrade though, because the opening/ending sequences were much better this time around and with better songs and I found myself rewinding to check some specific scenes created solely for the OP/ED. But that is all the positive feedback I can give to it, since the animation seems very simple most of the time and I was not a fan of some of the special effects used. However, they really tried bringing to life some of the game’s animations, which was welcome. Sound-wise, there was nothing impressive, but the voice actors were good (especially Godot, even though I didn’t like Hiroaki Hirata as a choice at first) and the OST is decent, with the 2nd OP being a weakness of mine.Summing up, this is still not a great anime, but CloverWorks fixed to a big extent the problems that were there before and offered us an enjoyable watch, at least. If you are a fan of the game, you should definitely watch this. And if you are not, this deserves a chance someday! 1 game, which meant there was plenty of time for everything and indeed, they gave the final case the space it needed which made the series shine in the end with some great moments and a most well done climax, unlike the prequel.Of course, this does not make everything great, as things still may be fast and there are various fillers that are just really boring (albeit some being on point!), but the changes have been welcome and it makes the experience much better for people who may have not played the games.

Sound-wise, there was nothing impressive, but the voice actors were good (especially Godot, even though I didn’t like Hiroaki Hirata as a choice at first) and the OST is decent, with the 2nd OP being a weakness of mine.Summing up, this is still not a great anime, but CloverWorks fixed to a big extent the problems that were there before and offered us an enjoyable watch, at least. If you are a fan of the game, you should definitely watch this. And if you are not, this deserves a chance someday!', ""Please go play the games, don't watch this...Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations is one of the greatest Anime games ever made, I stand by that statement. How do you take a character like Godot, who is arguably top 3 Ace Attorney characters of all time and turn it into this...?STORY:Gyakuten Saiban: Sono Shinjitsu, otherwise known as Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations, follows the story of that game while adding in meaningless filler. Do you remember a whole train arc that spans 5 episodes in the original game? No? Well it completely disrupts the flow of cases, in a storyline where every case is...crucial to the underlying story. The whole point was mirroring Mia Fey's beginnings, with Phoenix's gained experience at this point, showing how much he's surpassed his mentor since, while giving meaningful insight to Godot's character. What does the filler have to do with that? Fuck all, that's what. To make matters worse, the poor pacing results in each case losing it's impact and being muddied down with the accompanying lack of care from Cloverworks.Recipe for Turnabout is unsurprisingly the worst part of this Anime, as it was with the game, however, there are significantly worse arcs that are in the series, with Turnabout Big Top of JFA fame already being adapted in the previous season.Overall, story wise most of the important details are there, albeit stretched out significantly, to the point it makes the long cases from the original VN seem short in comparison.ANIMATION:I really try not to stress about this too much in most of my reviews, but this is an exception. The charming visuals from the original VN are just gone altogether, replaced with this monstrosity. Cloverworks, after a incredibly upsetting first season, took no initiative to improve whatsoever.If we're basing this off the original VN then this is a 9/10 for me, but the Anime is a 4/10.

that the Ace Attorney series could have anything even resembling an overarching narrative.\xa0 A strange surprise, but certainly a welcome one.Story:More cases, more peculiar murders, and one suspicious woman that seems to keep popping up in everything that\'s going on, the follow up to Naruhodo Ryuuichi\'s start in his career as a defense attorney has him tackle more of these cases, this time with a lot more backstory and a lot more quirks to be had.Noted as an adaptation from the third game of the Ace Attorney series, a lot...doesn\'t really change from the story aside from continuing to adapt cases from the source material, doing a sort of \'animated tutorial\' with a hundred percent less trial and error hoping that you just \'happen\' on the right answer since Naruhodo is a lot smarter of a defense attorney than (apparently) most people give him credit for.\xa0 The quality of the show varies on a literal case by case basis as some of the defense cases are more interesting than others, so the overall story flow fluctuates depending on who or what is getting their time in the spotlight.The one differing aspect from S2\'s story this time around is the fact that the show has a set narrative regarding the past and presents of Naruhodo and his friends from the Ayasato clan, which by in large made the show a lot more interesting than should be given credit for since it surprisingly enough ties a number of things together in ways I didn\'t think needed to be done, and actually for once engrossed me in the story and the eventual reveal and unveiling of everything since Season 1 was a series that I found either fun or exhausting to watch depending on who was slated to be put in the slammer.\xa0 Really if it hadn\'t been for three cases this time around all revolving around the same cast of characters and painting a full story within the lore of Ace Attorney, I probably wouldn\'t have batted much of an eye at the whole thing.Characters:The staying factors of Naruhodo and Mayoi haven\'t really changed much beyond the explorations of their characters through their backstories.\xa0 Since a massive chunk of this season is devoted to focusing on a select few cases that all revolve around the same cast, most of where their characters shine happens here where they\'re at the forefront of the topic at hand due to their heavy involvement with the accused, culprits, and witnesses during these trials.\xa0 It\'s a nice change of pace since now Naruhodo has to put aside his personal ties in order to do his job, adding a nice bit of conflict to the usual zany cases that I\'m sure would make any self respecting defense attorney want to take up the bottle due to the kinds of clues and convoluted plans these cases entail.The rest of the recurring cast like the judge and Chief Itono don\'t really shift all that much since their roles are primarily comedic fodder that also serves as the legal/civil team that helps with the investigations of these cases.\xa0 The only major changes here exist in Mitsurugi\'s role largely being pushed to the side with only one episode really dedicated to him, and the mysterious prosecutor Godot, who I would really think should be dead after ingesting so much black coffee in such a short amount of time.As for the side characters who serve as the show\'s \'main attraction\', most if not all come back to be the series\'s usual, quirky side cast that does their best at being (usually) hair pullingly annoying with varying mileage on my tolerance towards them depending on the case.\xa0 Primarily one and done characters where solving the case/convicting the right person finishes their involvement with the series, a few that appear in the middle of the series show up to bring about that overarching narrative that I\'ve been mentioning a few times.\xa0 Strangely enough, the characters involved with THOSE cases feel a lot more like real people rather than oddities of society, making at the very least some of their actions seem plausible and a lot more interesting due to the results of their actions.Aesthetics:With CloverWorks picking up the slack from A-1\'s work from Season 1, personally I don\'t really see a difference with the artwork.\xa0 Maybe a little more saturated than the shiny and bright polish that A-1 did when the series was in their hands, but the series largely looks the same, and that\'s a lot better than what I was expecting since I usually expect a show that changes hands to boast an equally dramatic shift in art quality as well.Likewise, the show still did its best to keep the little \'quirks\' with everyone at the podium, animating replications of all the sprite movements that admittedly were a lot more annoying than I initially remember them being since I\'m positive the they were just trying to fill up time with how often they were using them.Personally I didn\'t find much of many of the songs to be much of interest this time.\xa0 At most I\'d probably give Tomohisa Yamashita\'s songs ""Never Lose"" and ""Reason"" credit for being an interesting pieces to listen to with their more mellow and modern beats, which while somehow really out of place with Ace Attorney, were definitely interesting choices that work well as songs to listen to on their own.Final Thoughts:I honestly thought that this season would just be the \'obligatory\' watching continuation of a series that I decided to watch on a whim and would continue doing so because I typically don\'t like leaving series unfinished when there\'s more material to watch.\xa0 And for once I\'m glad that I put time into watching it this time around because I had significantly more enjoyment this time around with the series.While a number of the early cases in the season weren\'t really all that stellar, it\'s the last few that really made the series feel like it was worth watching beyond the quirky and borderline illegal murder court cases.\xa0 I\'m pretty sure a lot of what\'s happening in that court room is a felony in and of itself.\xa0 The fact that I felt engrossed watching the show when I previously didn\'t really bat much of an eye towards Season 1 due to it seeming just average is a monumental improvement over what my expectations had initially put this series at.\xa0 Man, people were right in saying that last case is their favorite.\xa0 In context to everything, I can see why.If you\'re an Ace Attorney fan, you\'re probably the one I would recommend this series to.\xa0 While I typically relate the adaptation in closeness to the original source material, I\'m not really qualified to say how close it is to the games.\xa0 But at the very least I can say from the perspective of someone who has no idea what goes on in this series that

Spirit of Justice, I can say this anime is being executed perfectly. With the addition of 3 extra cases (Young Edgeworth case, the train case and the seashell case) A-1 Studios does a good job of replicating the original game which I enjoyed a lot. Plus they are managing to add some funny scenes from here to there. But man, Godot dude. Always loved that dude. His voice actor is godlike.The only thing I might have an issue with is the voice actor of Phoenix. He sadly is not...the original voice actor of Phoenix who is Shu Takumi in the original AA games. But since Shu Takumi is fairly old I can see why they haven't placed him there.Overall. this anime is a solid 10\\10. The character's voice actors are perfect, the storytelling is also amazing, this whole anime is just as good as the actual game is. I recommend anyone who hasn't played the original AA games to download deSume and play all of the trilogy games + Apollo Justice.

I just found the cases incredibly confusing and not much creativity in scenarios.Animation: the visuals are still colorful and the videogames' likeness is...still present. I'm happy they didn't change this.Sound: the soundtrack is pleasant and both OPs were excellent choices.

Or, if you really can't get enough of Phoenix Wright, here is some more!Personally, I enjoyed it, because I haven't played the games, and it was a good laugh seeing just how far they can go with all these silly plots and conspiracies.They also added an almost-decent filler trial, and some nice backstory episodes!But, from a technical standpoint, it's not a marvel.The characters are still mostly stale, except for Edgeworth. There is little growth. Music is average at best, with one or...two good songs and lots of repetition. Animation, while better than the first season, is still not up to much. Most characters are annoying, and the plot is crazy of course.Once before, when in doubt, check out the first trial, maybe the second, and see how you feel! two good songs and lots of repetition.

I also think that the music choice near the end of the season was really cool. The intensity of the courtroom really heated up with the help of the music.

Here too I repeat that, in my opinion, this is an anime that can be appreciated only if you have played the video game (so much so that I, as soon as I finished seeing the last episode, I felt a pang in the heart and a deep sadness...in knowing that this re-immersion in the world of Ace Attorney is over again).

Ok so this is my first ever review of an anime so yeah i suck at making reviews lol, but here we go:   (Oh yeah bad english incoming lol)I really enjoyed watching this season and i really recomand it. Not just this season, i recomand watching the first one, this one and play all the gamesStory: 8In my opinion the story is very good, i really like how they manage to make some sort of connection between some cases from season 1 with the ones from season 2. A thing that i hate, is that in every case they bring the witness,...they say what they have to say, but then he becomes a suspect and in the end the witness was the criminal.Art: 7Ok so, season 1 was animated by A-1 Pictures, but this season was animated by CloverWorks. So for the first season the animation wasn't really amazing, and i can say that for season 2 the animation was better.

We find out more about her past, and other things.Enjoyment: 8So idk what i can really say here but i really liked the last case and the on in train.

Perhaps this is why I found it much more enjoyable, but it may just be the material. In essence, compared to the first season, the second season of Ace Attorney was a breath of fresh air and what I consider a somewhat alright way of experiencing the story.The art style is, of course, the same as the first season; meaning that it is still not very good. However, I would have been even more disappointed if they did attempt any improvements that were more than...just ""minor."" Completely changing the art style is not a good move, and I am glad that they had at least enough common sense to not do that.The soundtrack is still great, naturally, as many remixed tracks of the first season are re-used here and tracks from Trials and Tribulations are also remixed here. However, I noticed that one of the most important tracks (""The Bitter Taste of Truth"") was left in its original GBA/DS state or changed very minorly. This definitely stuck out to me as someone who had been enjoying the remixes already apparent in the soundtrack. However, I would say that overall, the anime uses more original songs and remixes from the first season more than newer songs. I did not like that very much, but it\'s not a dealbreaker.The story here, while not as refined and complete as the experience in the game, is heaps better than the first season. Having 23 episodes for one game certainly benefitted compared to cramming two games into one season. I couldn\'t imagine the horror if they tried to combine T&T and Apollo Justice (absolute mess of a storyline, timeskip, etc.) Trials and Tribulations really made sense of the previous two Ace Attorney titles and made the story of the Feys, Dahlia Hawthorne, DL-6, etc. really interconnected more so than the other titles. The anime has the same effect, but naturally, certain emotions are lost from the format change from a game to an anime. Also, certain moments are completely removed.I enjoyed the certain bonus episodes present as they gave in-depth looks into certain characters; although none of them are really canon and are just filler. However, as someone who is fascinated with fan-canon, I appreciate these episodes. There\'s even an entirely new ""case,"" Turnabout Express. From the outset, you can tell it\'s not written like an episode in a pre-2013 Ace Attorney title, and this benefits it because it feels like it was meant for an anime rather than a game.Once again, I did watch in dub mainly because I cannot stand JP Phoenix\'s voice and subtitles that don\'t have the localized versions of the names. However, this time I didn\'t bother to watch the sub so I can\'t give advice about it. Dubbed voices are pretty great overall, and I especially like Godot\'s voice compared to the original game. Other highlights include Phoenix, Edgeworth, Franziska, Luke Atmey, Jean Armstrong, Mia, etc.I did enjoy the anime, but once again I would recommend playing the game for the full, ""definitive"" experience.

The story is impeccable, the art is fantastic, the soundtrack is unique, and the characters are enjoyable.Although it's a bit different from the main series, episode 12 of Jashin-chan Dropkick still gives a satisfying conclusion to the series. The characters of the show all come together for one last fun day together on the beach after Jashin-chan comes back and Yurine wins the trip.Although the episode had some flaws, I still was able to find it enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the references to other anime that appeared, as well as the well-animated fight...scene that comes up halfway through the episode.The soundtrack was pretty standard, being mostly the same with the canon series. However, the addition of tell you, tell me by Yasuko Sasaki gave a new image to the final episode. The drastic difference in song during the fight scene really breathed new light onto the finale and made the experience more enjoyable.At the end of the day, Jashin-chan Dropkick was able to provide an entertaining series, with this final episode excelling in the ability to wrap-up a perfect series for everyone to enjoy. scene that comes up halfway through the episode.The soundtrack was pretty standard, being mostly the same with the canon series.

We have seen it countless times already. Highschool of the Dead, Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka, Deadman Wonderland, Nazo no Kanojo X and a few other OVAs that are completely bullshit and fucking useless to the story. On top of that, Episode 12 of Jashin-chan Dropkick is a fucking beach episode.The most peculiar thing about it is, unlike the OVAs from the series I already used for comparison, this one is surprisingly good. It's probably better than any episode of the main anime by itself. You know, in opposition to the first eleven...episodes with fucking nothing and dumb gags that makes you feel guilty for finding them funny, I'm pretty found of the storyline of this one.Heck, the thing is: we get some conflict here. And it's more than we already saw before in this anime. It's surprisingly nice to watch. You obviously won't like it if you already don't like the main series, but it's worth a try if you find it at least entertaining. episodes with fucking nothing and dumb gags that makes you feel guilty for finding them funny, I'm pretty found of the storyline of this one.Heck, the thing is: we get some conflict here.

However, is watching the OVA worth your time?The OVA take place right were Jashin-chan Dropkick ended. Yurine won a trip to a tropical island, so you know what that means? BEACH EPISODE! It's fanservice all the way and the anime in typical Jashin-chan style shows everyone, but then I mean everyone in swimsuits. It is shameless and really for an OVA I won't mind it at all.What is surprising are the fight scenes in the end. It looked...like Nomad had some money left and thought ''Ah fuck it let's make some fight scenes''. It ended up looking pretty good and really showed that Nomad is capable of making great fight scenes.Other then that, it is your typical Jashin-chan Dropkick episode: the whole comedy spectrum again gets explored and they don't beat one joke until it is dead. So in short: If you liked Jashin-chan Dropkick, then this is just more of it. Nothing more and nothing less. like Nomad had some money left and thought ''Ah fuck it let's make some fight scenes''.

Hakozume: Kouban Joshi no Gyakushuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49519/Hakozume__Kouban_Joshi_no_Gyakushuu,"['Of all the series starting off the new year of a very dry Winter season, mangaka Miko Yasu\'s Hakozume a.k.a Police in a Pod definitely stood out for being one of the most interesting works ever made. A manga that clinched a win in the 66th Shogakukan Manga Awards in the Best General Manga category, alongside Inio Asano\'s Dead Dead Demon\'s Dededede Destruction last year (which is now finally getting an anime adaptation), it\'s no secret that this work is truly something special, and it all had to do with the fact that Miko Yasu herself, was once an ex-cop working in Japan\'s kouban (a.k.a...police box) police force.Before I go further, I would like to elaborate specificially that the police culture of the East and the West are vastly different, and that has lead to some unnecessary triggering of comparisons made that could extend itself into a hate rant (I\'m looking at you ANN), so please do not snare up any hateful rants here as well.Back to the main topic, Hakozume\'s main episodic stories and arcs are based off of Miko Yasu\'s personal real-life experiences working in the police force for approximately 10 years, but was saddened by Japan\'s culture of overwork, and this manga was her way to spread understanding about the profession to encourage public support. She joined the police force in her local kouban as a low-level officer doing crime prevention publicity campaigns, her inspiration for joining being that she felt empathy for families of crime victims, but ultimately left when the officer that filled her role when she took her childcare leave, died of overwork. Being the victim of someone\'s death can instill emotional guilt, and as best as Miko Yasu tried to cope with the trauma and rallied recruitment efforts, there is yet another turning point of disheartenment to see that the younger generation wasn\'t all that interested in being a police officer. One boy whom she asked, said that he expressed interest but had some skepticism of the profession, claiming that it was too high of an order for someone like him whom struggled to take care of himself. It was this reason that Miko Yasu decided to convey the message that police officers aren\'t necessarily upright and honourable people, just regular human beings doing their best on the job. And being a low-level officer herself, it was easy to pitch to publishing companies like Kodansha\'s Morning magazine to get her work serialized, but although she had experience drawing portraits during her time in the police force, it\'s because of her inexperience drawing manga that forced her to quit the profession and focus on refining her art to be suitable for serialization. So, to see all the effort finally getting an anime adaptation produced by Madhouse under Kaiji director Yuuzou Satou (aside from last year\'s Nippon TV live-action drama), everything has come around full circle.This story is supported by the fact that the main female police officer Mai Kawai, serves as a fictional person of the mangaka herself, who\'s all but done from the police force. Kawai joined the force to earn a stable income, unlike her crude father that ended up on the opposite end of the spectrum. Being a fresh graduate from the Police Academy, she wasn\'t treated all that well when she was transferred to the local Machiyama Police Box, being hurled hurting remarks that are spokesbeing of the culture and the reception of the outside people. These issues are serious enough for Kawai to throw her letter of resignation, but that was stopped when a new instructor steps in: Seiko Fuji, a once detective chief that got demoted to a sergeant and transferred out for harassing her junior. And man, is Seiko-chan such a ruthless woman to stand her grounda amidst pressure, guiding the almost-resigned Kawai into comedic antics from the usual rank-and-file cases ranging from burglary to assault. And every single one of these chapters has a purpose, referencing back to how Miko Yasu had seen and heard the exact same issues in her police lifetime.To edge the profession ever further, there\'s the Astro Brothers of Sergeant Seiji Minamoto and his detective sidekick helper Takeshi Yamada. Like Seiko-chan, Minamoto has an eerily similar personality to Fuji, so much so that they tend to clash a lot, putting both Kawai and Yamada as their juniors to shudder in fear. And since everyone knows each other from Police Academy, it\'s easy to say that both Fuji and Minamoto were in loggerheads with one another, brought to the real work life where the troubles never end. But as much as these two are tutors to their junior counterparts, they do act the role as superiors when life matters most in the fight against crime, solo or syndicate. The Machiyama Police Box has also Miwa Makitaka as a backup force, mainly dealing with stalkers and sex crimes, but with a drawback that her entire world was surrounded with girls and not being accustomed to men. Despite this, she\'s an iron-fist clad of a woman to stand her ground against the criminals oppressing her, and male-centric divisions like Criminal Affairs will step in if she needs help to handle the most difficult of men. Overall, to bring similar figures that Miko Yasu has known in her 10-year cycle in the police force be replicated to the manga, it really shows how much the audience can really mistake police control in the horrid ways of the real world, though depending on where you live, police brutality will always be the the central taboo.It\'s glad to have Madhouse produce more shows outside of their comfort zone, now with the studio\'s recent revival and dabbing into other genres. Along with last season\'s vampire comedy show Kyuuketsuki Sugu Shinu a.k.a The Vampire Dies in No Time, Madhouse is chosen to adapt yet another comedy series, albeit one that\'s focusing more on the police force, and I think like the many recent works Madhouse still has that unmistakable quality that\'s instantly recognizable. The elephant in the room is with director Yuuzou Satou, of which I\'ve mentioned that he is famous for the Kaiji series. He hasn\'t had a breakout work since Kaiji Season 2 a decade ago, and finally found his stride with this show. It\'ll be a long while before he comes back with another work, so for now, enjoy while you can Satou-san.Music is pretty decent too with Riko Azuna and nonoc at the helm. I\'d think that I gravitate more towards nonoc\'s ED ""Change"" because of famous Vocaloid composer DECO*27, and I know this because DECO*27 composes really good songs that I\'ve heard before, so the standard is there.Works like this are rare to find, even one that\'s worth the inspiration to be adapted into anime, and I thank mangaka Miko Yasu for being a source of inspiration to draw and illustrate what was once her life\'s job into manga form, that you can\'t really find anywhere else. And because this is the AniManga industry, I hope that you don\'t carry over the overwork culture from your police days to drawing manga.

Though often comedic, the show still manages to carry a serious tone when dealing with the darker aspects of police work.  The characters are what really sell the show though,...and I found them to be very enjoyable, particularly once the wider cast of supporting actors is introduced and fleshed out enough to begin to have some real depth.  The comedy was mostly on point for me, with there being a bit of repetition in some cases, but not enough to drag the show down.  For most of its run, up until the final few episodes, the show is largely episodic, which fits its style well, given that the second main draw of this show, after its characters and comedy, is the fascinating look it takes at the daily lives of policemen.In sum, if quirky, but largely believable characters and a humorous take on modern police work sounds like something you would be interested in, then you'll probably love this show, like I did.  If those things aren't interesting to you though, then this show will probably fall flat for you. and I found them to be very enjoyable, particularly once the wider cast of supporting actors is introduced and fleshed out enough to begin to have some real depth.

Which is surprising honestly. You'd think there would be a fair few series. You see it in certain animes, where there is a detective agency, or a police friend. But that's about it, so it's real nice to actually have a show, that's more directed towards that. Props to show for that.As for how the show is? While it can be hit or miss at times, but it's certainly worth a watch...I'd say.  There are many different reasons as to why you can enjoy such a show, and why it'd keep your attention from start to finish.The art and sound are really great touches when it comes to this show. There is so much little details, and things don't look a mess in both ends of the field. The movement of the animation is real good too. While the art style isn't breathtaking as certain other things. But it's still certainly a highlight.The story in itself is real simple to get, and that's not a discredit to the show. But more to it's themes. It's not a world danger plot line, and it doesn't need to be. What it is, is a well thought out police show, that honestly we need more of. It doesn't beat around the bush with things, it treats the idea of being a cop very seriously. As for the story elements? Well. Imagine not liking your job, and struggling. Along with some deep running backstory that really touches at your heart strings. Only for someone new to walk in, whom is an experienced model at said job, and is now your mentor. Turning what you thought wasn't a good fit for you, into something that can be wort while. But in as a story sense. It almost feels like you're watching Cops be...Well cops. In a more cute, and sometimes funny way. Sometimes very personal too. They really don't leave anything out. The second episode is a perfect example of this. Topics that are very hard to deal with, but you'll learn quickly just how more serious the life of a cop can be.As for the characters themselves. They're a fun bunch, and have nice features about them, and their personalities that make them likable. They do their job, and they're good in their own right. Seiko is as beautiful as her professionalism is. She fits the mentor role super well. With Mai as the one she is mentoring, as she tries her best to be a cop, now that's she entered the fray.

The show doesn't forget to remind us of the harsh reality, that world is a cruel place and people die sometimes.

It could sound like a gross simplification, but that is the whole argument. The anime shows a girl that wants to quit her position of a cop in a kouban because she feels disappointed at her job, forgetting the reasons to be a cop in the first place. Then, another cop appears, and shows her, through a completely dull and generic set of occurrences, that cops can save lives, families, the whales, the world, and the aliens. If I...were paranoid, I would think that the main girl is supposed to be the audience, an audience that have forgotten the importance of cops in modern society and thinks about them as beasts that rob money and applies violence into the populace. And while I live in a complete shithole, so the past definition fits the cops here, I suppose that in Japan it is not the case. So, ignoring the fact that this is an advertisement to get people into the police, is this anime worth to be watched?I would go with no; this anime is just riddled with an utter lack of creativeness. The dialogues are beyond horrible, they add absolutely no energy, personality, or life to the series, it somehow just explains the line of thought that one can infer from the events that are being shown in screen, in the most agnostic and straight form. One could easily replace the dialogues with a chatbot powered by GPT-3, and that chatbot would give us more humanity to whatever was described here. The abhorrent dialogues just flat the interactions of the criminals and cops, they feel cartoony and preachy, was that the intention? The same lack of creativeness can be found in the diverse set of criminal events that happens through the series, I will do a game here, answer the next questions:-\tAn underage girl is having compensated dating, have a high body count, and have a new stepfather. Why is the girl like that?-\tA grandmother is lonely and do criminal acts to get the attention that she doesn’t get from her family. Which is the solution?-\tA person asks the number to a cop. Which is the punchline?Maybe I’m a disturbed person that have read too much hentai and watched too many detective shows, but the way the anime presents any of the past premises makes the whole experience just a continuous eye-roll. It can’t catch the attention to anyone who have watched more than one cop show in their life, because it doesn’t add anything to the viewer, it is just a portrait of anything you should already know, without characters that add flavor. The problem is that there is no fun in having a set of events with a direct moral direction and a direct cause-consequence that can be easily inferred, the fun exists on the dilemmas, contradictions, argument fights, problems related with how the cop world functions. And that doesn’t exist in Hakozume, the problem of Hakozume is that the intention of the show is nothing but to pander and create a common ground where nothing can be debated, the characters are uncharismatic so you don’t feel alienated by their presence, the events are easy to grab so you don’t get a multidimensional interpretation, the jokes have the same wittiness as your uncle after drinking way too much in a dinner, it just doesn’t try to provoke anything but admiration.While all those problems exist, there are some good aspects of this show. The colorful palette and crisp designs make you fall easily in a comfort zone, it is just an anime that is easily digestible by the eyes. There are also some interesting intersections between the role of the woman in a male dominated field and their perspective, and most of the events have a moral lesson that can be useful for a person that have never been watched or read anything about it, or to confirm your ideas about it too, confirming your own morals in an anime is really fun!!In conclusion, the worst aspect of this show is how offensive its unoffensive narrative is. The show is just worth watching if you are either a want to be cop (So you get motivation), a person that is unaware of what a cop is (So you get a solid biased perspective about it), or a cop that is about to retire because the ACAB sentiment is growing strong. In any other case, the anime fails at being funny (Can we get an episode about this anime being arrested for comedy homicide?), interesting, innovative, emotive, surprising, and any other positive adjective that could make it watchable. The main conclusion is, if being a cop in Japan is this boring, why couldn’t they include some non-robotic characters? were paranoid, I would think that the main girl is supposed to be the audience, an audience that have forgotten the importance of cops in modern society and thinks about them as beasts that rob money and applies violence into the populace. And while I live in a complete shithole, so the past definition fits the cops here, I suppose that in Japan it is not the case. So, ignoring the fact that this is an advertisement to get people into the police, is this anime worth to be watched?I would go with no; this anime is just riddled with an utter lack of creativeness. The dialogues are beyond horrible, they add absolutely no energy, personality, or life to the series, it somehow just explains the line of thought that one can infer from the events that are being shown in screen, in the most agnostic and straight form.

Like Judy Hopps from Zootopia, the main duo spends most of their time writing speeding tickets. And since this anime takes place in Japan, half their time is also spent catching underaged smokers and teenagers who skip school.Mai Kawai is a new police officer fresh from the academy. Why does she join the police? Her father lost his job due to a company scandal, so he wanted her to work in civil service. And this was the only civil service job she could get. Such noble intentions! And she hates the work! Or at least, she feels...uncomfortable when civilians insult her as a police officer, so she’s about to resign when she meets…Sergeant Seiko Fuji, a former member of the Criminal Investigations Department. When her “aggressive pep talk” gets reported as bullying, she gets demoted to the police box and becomes Kawai’s mentor. She curses like the proverbial sailor, and she’s the most competent among the police and detectives.As police officers, Kawai and Fuji deal with more sensitive issues, including pedophilia and suspected elder abuse. The police and detectives have a lot of respect and compassion for people, and each story ends on a light-hearted note.There's a lot of sexism from civilians toward the policewomen, but the police department responds well, and they have a great work dynamic. Kawai and Fuji's senpai-kohai relationship is so wholesome! Fuji is definitely the mentor we all need. uncomfortable when civilians insult her as a police officer, so she’s about to resign when she meets…Sergeant Seiko Fuji, a former member of the Criminal Investigations Department.

Its kinda slice of life mixed with real Japanese police tactics, and it doesn't really try to be more than that. Yes, there are are very sad/even horrific scenes in this anime, but the tone tends to stay lighthearted.I enjoyed that it talks about how being a cop in Japan can obliterate your private life in certain aspects.

In case of a natural disaster, you probably won't be there to protect your own family...and yet that's the job they signed up for. Its really sad, but realistic. And they just learn to live with that...kinda. Sake helps when dates go bust.I also enjoyed how they don't try to make it seem glamourous. Stake outs take forever and you could be up for several days smelling like trash by the end of it. You could be stuck doing paperwork all night after someone calls 9-1-1 simply for attention. Or you could be called to help recover an old man's dead body so the family can move on.I liked how despite it being light hearted, it was real.

Japanese police work culture is nuts.', ""*Note: May contain spoilers*Storyline:------------I rate this to be a 8, this is not because of the poor writing or a bad story. It's mostly because a normal world style anime that is about any emergency service can become dull real fast. Not all locations may see action all the time and even if they do it may not even the same things.In this case the story is based in a fairly quiet area which might have been a mistake. This also adds to what's going on in the episodes. Not all episodes are even flashed out properly to really get a good understanding what might...be going on with the police officers and their jobs. Cases get completed in record time usually and mostly end up pretty good. With the exception of 1 episode where a baby is suggested to have died during a car crash.You do see the stress the officers are going trough and what they need to do for training. Which is insane if you think about the insane work hours and having to train on top of that would make anyone feel like a slave. And yes with this you will end up with police officers that can do quite big mistakes if not collapse on the job. This is to a minor extend also added to the anime.However doing things in record time really breaks the whole point of the story I think. I really can not see why this is done other then financial reasons or more likely people in high places trying to change things in favor of filling their own pockets and ignoring common sense.Graphics:-----------The graphics look decent, also a bit thicker lined then most anime giving it it's own charme. There are even moments you get to see pretty realistic scenes that add to the whole experience. It's different, but not worse then most anime. I actually think it has a touch of older anime styles which in my mind does give it a positive flair.Sound:---------At times a bit disappointing as the studio could have done more to up their game in this. It's often leaving the impression of a soft and empty world. You don't hear other traffic for example, even the police cars are rarely audible which is odd. Even the office scenes  are oddly silent in favor of allowing viewers to hear what the characters say. This takes you out of the immersion and it seriously paints a wrong picture of reality. If you can get this done in a movie, then why would it not be possible for a anime that realistically speaking has far more options?Characters:--------------First I want to address the big pink elephant in the room, why did they choose to name the main character 'kawai'??? I mean, 'cute police officer' doesn't make you like it more. It just distracts every time and it makes a joke out of the entire anime. Even worse, this very same character is depicted as being cute and weak, while she should have been getting a very good training to even get in that job position to start with. She wants to quit at the start of her career only to get reminded of it at the very end returning her to the 'cute state' theme.Seiko is often standing around when she should actually be stepping in and doing something. She should be the superior to Kawai, but choses not to teach her but instead does her thing as in 'either you pay attention and get better or you fail'. The typical push into the deep end without the floaty arm things. At the very end she even acts smugly towards Kawai as in wanting to say 'see, I did teach you well' which would be obviously a bs take on things.All other characters are mostly there to add to the story, but not really adding something making them feel hollow. This specially in the special division case and that of the deputy chief who blow a lot of smoke but are fairly pointless characters in the end. The deputy chief isn't even in the last 2 episodes which adds to that testament as he should be present.Overall:----------I did enjoy watching to some extend (too hot here, mind kept wandering off due to that) With everything included I can give this anime a solid 7. I wish the characters were better and the sound was done a lot better, then I would have given it a 8, perhaps even a 9. be going on with the police officers and their jobs.

Kawai decides to throw in the towel and is about to turn in her resignation only a few months into her work when Seiko Fuji, a star member of the Criminal Affairs Division, enters their precint and becomes her new mentor and partner.PLOT - 9/10The premise and concept of Police in a Pod is extremely unique and I believe is the strongest point of the show. It provides a glimpse into the lives of police offers...and the various struggles that they face while serving the people. With the author having served 10 years in the police force as a female officer, Police in a Pod serves as her way of shining a light on the field. Personally, I found this really interesting as you're able to see the inner workings of what goes in behind the work of police officers. What I loved most are the serious and often heart-wrenching and heart-warming themes and topics that are tackled throughout each episode. For that alone, I really appreciated this show despite maybe having some episodes that do not measure up to the better episodes throughout the season.ART / SOUND - 7/10Police in a Pod boasts an old school and seemingly hand-drawn art style. I find it unique and definitely eye catching especially with the characters. The characters are well designed with heavy focus on their eyes and I really liked their various expressions throughout the show. It also has decent action sequences as expected from Madhouse. However, the art style stands out a bit too much for me. It includes heavy outlines on the characters and there are some frames that the contrast between the characters models and the background is just too noticeable that it makes it look as if the characters were cut from a magazine and pasted onto a canvas; something that I was not very fond of and grew extremely noticeable. The music is alright, I guess. Nothing really stood out to me too much.CHARACTERS - 7/10The characters didn't feel too special to me. What I liked most was the dynamic between Kawai and Fuji as mentor and mentee but also as friends. Supporting characters bring a nice added layer of development and interaction among the characters which was appreciated. Overall, the characters are all very likeable and it is nice seeing how they have certain specialties which is necessary for a successful team. One thing I felt could have been improved on was the pacing of Kawai's growth as an officer. I felt that throughout the season there were limited moments where in she was able to exhibit her growth in competence as an officer. Often she would just learn a thing or two by the end of the episode from her seniors, but isn't really able to apply any of it until the final arc with the big special investigation. I would have liked to see her showcase her growth and development more gradually throughout the season to give us viewers something more to cheer for.ENJOYMENT - 5/10Okay, listen, I want to like this show, I really do. From its unique premise and art style to its characters, I really wanted to. BUT, it can be very hard to watch and extremely boring at times. Police in a Pod has some great episodes and moments that can be extremely touching, sometimes eye-opening, and great comdeic moments and those are the highest points when watching this show. However, there are more times that it is just a slog to watch and is barely entertaining at all. Maybe it's just me, but I found many parts quite boring. I actually stopped following it weekly after Episode 5 because it simply didn't excite me and I had nothing to look forward to anymore. When all the episodes finished airing, I decided to finish it just for the sake of it and it was still tough to get through at times.OVERALL - 6/10Police in a Pod has an excellent and unique premise with how it looks to shine a light on the lives of police officers and specifically the challenges of female officers in the field. It has a unique art style that I do appreciate but is personally not for me, but I definitely see the appeal it may have for others. The show tackles serious themes and has flashes of good comedic moments, but ultimately lacks excitement and enjoyability when watching it.

This series did not deviate much from what I thought about it in the first episode. A cute and funny, mediocre, slideshow presentation tier, police propaganda series. It\'s an episodic series about two police women and the rest of their coworkers. They go on to battle crime in Japan with a story written by a former police officer. As a result, there a lot of interesting insight into what it\'s like working for the Japanese police. It amazes me that amount of hand holding...that happens here seeing as though where I live the police will usually shoot first and ask questions later, and have a rotten history in general that leaves no room for respectability. I\'ve had my own experiences with psychopathic police officers who nearly shot me in the head over a simple misunderstanding. I\'ve been stopped and told ""your kind don\'t belong around here,"" behind police sirens of officers that most likely have white sheets in their closets. As a result, this series can make me feel uncomfortable at times.Kawaii is a coward who recently joined up and met Fuji, a psychopath that shows her the ropes with her cunning experience. The series takes an episodic approach. As a result, it\'s your usual hit and miss episodes back and forth since it\'s more difficult to write great standalone episodes back to back where the plot often goes nowhere. Fuji tends to figure things out quickly, though it feels ridiculous at times. Kawai is usually clueless as usual. The dynamic between Kawaii, the very weak person, and the sinister Fuji, is nowhere near the greatness of duos like Kei and Yuri from Dirty Pair that even make bad episodes better with their own dynamic. Kawaii is a quitter who lacks self-confidence, and became a police officer more by accident than because she really wanted to. Fuji got transferred because she was bullying another officer. They start to become close as the series goes, and Fuji becomes protective as well.Towards the end, they went for a grand finale type of story that went on for more than 1 episode. Honestly, they should have wrapped it up sooner as it was easily among the weakest parts of the series. The author tries to at times show the reality of what being an officer is like. As a result, one moment you can be laughing, the next horrified after a suicide attempt or the sight of a mangled baby. Kawai\'s ant like growth and development is nearly nonexistent as she often lacks any kind of real courage throughout most of the show. It\'s still adorable to watch how innocent she is in her career.The two eventually meet Minamoto and Yamada. Though they try to go out and have fun on their time off, they tend to get called a lot and can never really escape. There\'s a lot of focus on how much police officers get overworked here. I think the author had a coworker that passed away that way if I remember correctly.Now over, this was mostly forgettable. It didn\'t help that the animation looked pretty but was very lazy. There\'s something scary about their eyes. The constant slideshows were annoying. None of the music was memorable, but the opening and closing sequences were nice. Right from the start, the viewers get police butt shoved in their face. The only thing it had going for me was the occasional really funny joke. that happens here seeing as though where I live the police will usually shoot first and ask questions later, and have a rotten history in general that leaves no room for respectability.

They start to become close as the series goes, and Fuji becomes protective as well.Towards the end, they went for a grand finale type of story that went on for more than 1 episode. Honestly, they should have wrapped it up sooner as it was easily among the weakest parts of the series. The author tries to at times show the reality of what being an officer is like. As a result, one moment you can be laughing, the next horrified after a suicide attempt or the sight of a mangled baby. Kawai\'s ant like growth and development is nearly nonexistent as she often lacks any kind of real courage throughout most of the show. It\'s still adorable to watch how innocent she is in her career.The two eventually meet Minamoto and Yamada. Though they try to go out and have fun on their time off, they tend to get called a lot and can never really escape. There\'s a lot of focus on how much police officers get overworked here. I think the author had a coworker that passed away that way if I remember correctly.Now over, this was mostly forgettable. It didn\'t help that the animation looked pretty but was very lazy. There\'s something scary about their eyes. The constant slideshows were annoying. None of the music was memorable, but the opening and closing sequences were nice. Right from the start, the viewers get police butt shoved in their face. The only thing it had going for me was the occasional really funny joke.', ""Initially, I wouldn't dream of watching a comedy buddy cop anime about two police girls strolling around the neighbourhood, enforcing the law and making sure they abide by it, but here I am and I am pleased with what it has to offer.Story: 6/10If you are forced to do an essay about a life experience that forever changed your life, this would be it. The girl hates her job being a policewoman, given the fact that she didn't expect it to be quite a challenge, thus regretting her decisions. All of a sudden, a role model started coming into her life and becoming her partner,...while also acting as her mentor.Pretty normal, it doesn't do anything out of the ordinary than that. It follows a standard formula of having humour in some situations, treats sudden and mature themes with respect and empathy, while it doesn't offer an inspiring world, or out worldly fantasies that reel you in, it does a few things right just as I have stated.Art: 7/10On some occasions, the art may look a bit thick and inconsistent, but the characters are refreshing to watch other than your average loli, cute, and busty girls with one guy stuck as a generic nice guy. I like the way they look, albeit the use of CGI can sometimes abrupt my immersion, but it is indeed a pleasure to grasp all of it.Character: 7/10Like I said earlier, the main character seems to be uninspired, incompetent, and the kind of person who would take shortcuts along a hard path. Her flaws are noticeable yet she doesn't dwell on them and just continues her life as a normal person because that's what life offers in the end. On the other hand, you have an ambitious, wise-cracking former detective who can get pretty obnoxious if you leave her to her own devices, yet I don't hate on it, since both of them don't dwell on them too much where it makes them insufferable.

Anyone who likes their fair share of life being brought to screen can take their time off to enjoy this work. There's no overarching plot about some dark plans being revealed along the way and any edgy aspects of the story that could potentially ruin the story.

It oozes the feel of a Saturday Morning Cartoon / Slice of Life show, but strangely enough it later reverts into a traditional anime story line. And within that, it doesn't really have the space to breath properly.To row back a bit: Hakozume is somewhat sectionalized into three parts: the introduction, the middle, and the anime. All parts share some distinction thou. The general episode length is halved to around 11 minutes and they mostly encapsulate the protagonist Police Box Women Kawai and Fuji in their work.And the introduction part in a good step...in into their world and their personalities. But the show uses all its positive traits here.The middle section is a big let down in terms of characterization. This is highly likely due to the fact that the setting and premise changes drastically. Instead of just doing police box work, which mostly was minor work, they almost always end up in the Criminal Affairs station and with their characters in one way or the other. Sadly, it only shows to me that the original premise wasn't really enough to stay interesting. This is also partly due to the fact that aside the main pair, no other characters from their police box is introduced, ever. This middle part also is the one which feels the most random and episodes tend to vary wildly in their contents.The anime part (which in this case I would argue are the last 4 episodes) is where the renaissance of the show happens. And the starting flag for this is obviously the car traffic accident episode. It is a hard shift in tone in contrast to all episode before. And I commend it for finding itself in the dark abyss which is the police life. Such episodes are also good vehicles to contrast veterans and rookies. The earlier episodes did this as well, and the middle suffered from a tag-along syndrome where the rookie was thrown into problems our of her capacity with all veterans around her which mostly solved everything for her.The last 3 episodes form the core of the anime part. In this section the show tries to forgo its 11 minute episode runtime as these form a coherent story. But they feels extra weird when the (22-minute) episode starts a review of what happened in the last (11-minute) episode which literally happened 1 minute ago. Nonetheless, the arc structure is highly beneficial for this kind of show which emulates a comedy/slice of life/sitcom as their drama can have more time to breath and build longer terms of suspension.There isn't really much to talk about Hakozume in general. The starting story structure works in the small setting, hampers its growth in the middle part and abandon it completely by the end. Thus it is hard to see how a potential second season would play out. I could read the manga for it but the setting and the characters aren't that strongly developed to be this engaging. On that note, the adaptation seems to be extremely faithful to its origin in its content. The designs are somewhat changed from what I have seen, but it fits the characters better in that sense.For the most part the art and sound compliment the scenes but never take the attention.In total, Hakozume suffers from its roots and wants to evolve into something different. But the early decisions and an ever expanding core cast limit the potential the roots had to begin with. If the author would redo this whole season it probably would be a complete different thing. in into their world and their personalities.

Not everyone gets accepted into the #1 High School, or can get into college. So what happens to all the ordinary people left? Japan has a fairly large underclass of people living on benefits, and not all of them are elderly... Mai confronts an adulthood unsure about her future; and wanting to avoid the fate of her father who is...an alcoholic; she finds herself a rookie recruit to Japan\'s civil service. It\'s a job that doesn\'t require an entrance exam, has a low but stable salary, and at first glance appears easy enough; and she gets partnered up with Seiko Fuji and all she has to do is show up to work each day and ride around in a car and deal with fairly straightforward complaints from citizens and answer calls... should be easy right?Hahahahahahaaa!!!The show has a really good sense of humor. Mai\'s circumstances are relatable to anyone just starting out in their 20s and wondering what the rest of their life is supposed to look like. And all the rest of the people in her department started out the same way- but the people she first regards as kind of weird, maybe harsh, or baffling- are dedicated, hard working people all trying to do their part to keep their community safe. Her approach at first seems to be ""la dee da, what ever""- and the show does a brilliant job of making you think everything just the same old boring thing over and over- until the moment it isn\'t.There are episodes of this show that took my breath away. And once it gets going, you start to see how a job that lets anyone enter and anyone can do- comes with challenges that people in their cozy offices could never imagine.Mai\'s experience in the police force is confusing, demanding, exciting, and exhausting; and each day is entirely unpredictable. Long, agonizing hours of boring monotony are punctuated by moments of utter shock and bewilderment. You go from laughter to jaw dropping shock and overwhelming sadness without warning- and this is the life of a police officer.

The show's comedy and drama elements both work well, but it has an unfortunate habit of placing them too close together at times. Each episode typically adapts two or three standalone stories, bolted together with no particular theme, so it can be focused on lighthearted workplace drudgery one minute and the minutiae of examining a corpse the next.I don't normally comment on a show's OP and ED, but it's worth mentioning that...they are misleading, throwing fan service shots into what is otherwise a generally reserved series that would feel more at home alongside live-action cop shows than other workplace anime.

This is not You\'re under arrest, and the whole thing is a mixed bag, with serious ups and downs.The problem here is that the anime mixes comedy with dark gritty events of real life. The slice of life, light comedy, jokes, everyday events - those parts are entertaining to watch and are interesting. They\'re not, unfortunately,...on ""You\'re under arrest"" level, but they\'re genuinely entertaining, even though the characters are not exactly the most believable characters around. 6/10 material, pretty much.However, after that the anime switches to hard and dark topics, it handles them in awful manner, with a subtlety of being hit with a sledgehammer. It gets very preachy when darker aspects of life are touched, characters stop being lifelike, start rambling on and lecture the reader, and it starts looking like some sort of propaganda. It is thoroughly awful. Around 3/10 material, I\'d say.Another problem is that while You\'re Under Arrest featured adults, this anime even though it is well drown and adult proportioned seriously look like a lot of those characters are late teens at best and not adults that went through the academy. I\'m not sure what\'s up with that, but it does throw me off while watching it.The visuals are nice.

The first third consisted of standalone episodes that were designed to let the viewer get familiar/learn about the characters.  This is a pretty standard format that many 2...kour series follow.  First, have an episodic beginning to get to know the characters while giving clues to the bigger story that would start later.  Many times series wait too long to get on with the story.  In this case, I though that the first third was simply mediocre and it really didn&rsquo;t get me interested in the characters.  Also, there was way too much fanservice&hellip;  Ok, let me rephrase that, too much loli fanservice.  Even the action scenes were kind of boring to me.  In fact, right now I have trouble remembering anything during the first third of Kiddy Grade.Much to my surprise during the middle it actually got good.  The main story starts to move and the action scenes were quite exciting/good.  Let me just say, here is where we find about the past of our two heroines.  &Eacute;clair especially, has become more interesting.  However, I wouldn&rsquo;t say there was character development, rather they showed us what was already there.  Sadly the third arc simply isn&rsquo;t as good as the middle.  While there was lots of intense action, much of which is very well animated, there were way too many dues ex machina and poor writing in general.    The writers seemed to want to put in as many twists as humanly possible.  Many times I said to myself &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t expect us to believe that!&rdquo;  In short, the last third was a complete mess (hmm Gonzo messing up the end of a series, surprise surprise).As I said before the animation is quite good.  As it should as the 2 main draws of Kiddy Grade are the action scenes and fanservice.  Not much to say about the action scenes as this seems to be one of Gonzo&rsquo;s big budget titles.  Expect lots of well choreographed fight scenes with plenty of flash.  Character designs are quite nice however, I&rsquo;m not too fond of &Eacute;clair and Lumiere &ldquo;current&rdquo; look&hellip;Oh, as for the characters, there isn&rsquo;t much in terms of character development.  Instead we learn what was already there via flashbacks.  The most interesting character is &Eacute;clair and since it featured such a huge cast we don&rsquo;t really get to know the other characters very well.Anyway, was Kiddy Grade the action packed, fanservicey anime I expected?  Yes, there was plenty of action and fanservice and it is especially suited for mindless watching.  However, at the same time it had a poor beginning that makes it hard to start.  Furthermore, the last third was completely garbled and even with my brain turned off I had a hard to accepting many of the events.   There was quite a bit of potential shown in the middle, sadly it was never realized.  Who knows maybe Kiddy Grade 2 will actually utilize this potential. kour series follow.

From then-on things seem increasingly bleak, as you watch what you once regarded a light-hearted-comedy unfold into Drama , also there is less Fanservice :(The culminal point of the series leaves much to be desired, with the writhers probably exhausted form all the plot-twists in the previous chapter, they resolve to use an unprecedented number of deus-ex-machina plotpoints [spoiler]The Show itself kinda\' ends with one[/spoiler], but at least they didn\'t forget the Fanservice this time :DAll-in all Kiddy-Grade is definetly worth watching, and not just for the Eye-Candy, but also for the morally-enriching, if poorly-presented Story, and a Universe so vast and exotic, it would make many an RPG\'s pale in Comparison....If only they hadn\'t gone with Gonzo :( a distinguished look and feel.In the Second Chapter of the Series however, the atmosphere shifts radically as things take a turn for the worst, and thus the actual Plotline is Born.

I think I\'ve seen this one before.""  You might laugh at the mecha, ecchi, and sci-fi tags and never watch it.  The title might even scare you away.To some degree, you would be correct in your thought.  Kiddy Grade is about scantily clad women with super powers fighting bad guys, after all.  There are robots, space...ships, pseudo-science, super powers, guns, and panty shots. I have no idea what Gonzo was thinking when they titled it.  The first episode throws it all out on the table in one big mess, and anyone would be taken aback.  But slowly, it finds a way to tie it all together into a series that deserves a lot more praise than it normally gets.Story - 6/10With a mix of episodic plots making up several different arcs, Kiddy Grade tries to tell a lot of stories at once.  Give me just a moment to compare it to a crowd\'s favorite action series, Black Lagoon.Like Black Lagoon, it relies on action to keep you watching.  Neither show is character driven, and neither is driven by a deep and complex plot.  Both series accomplish their goal of sucking you in with action, albeit in different ways.  Black Lagoon is about guns, and while there are more than a few times that you have to suspend disbelief, it has its feet firmly planted in the world of reality.  Kiddy Grade, on the other hand, is not bound to our reality in any way.  It takes full liberty with this, as you can see by all the tags.  The first episode really hits it hard.  Receptionists fighting robots, then boarding a spaceship for a fight with a gang of criminals, posing a pizza delivery girls?  You read right, and I think a lot of people would close MPC or turn off their DVD player right about now.  I wouldn\'t blame you.  But give it a little time and things drop into place.In a nutshell:Éclair and Lumière are agents for the Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs (GOTT) and they go on a number of different missions, escorting officials and keeping order on problematic planets.  They regularly interact with other agents of the GOTT, with whom they are on mixed terms.  Eventually, however, a mission goes wrong and the GOTT is after them.  During these arcs, there are sometime single episodic plots.Like Black Lagoon, it is not very strong in the plot department.  So why a 6, and not a 4 or 5?  Black Lagoon uses the bounty hunter roll to tie the gunfights together, with the crew encountering events and people who drive the short mini-arcs. Kiddy Grade does the same thing, but with the tie of being agents, then criminals, of the the GOTT.  Black Lagoon is more relatable, but in my opinion Kiddy Grade is more interesting and creative if you are at all a fan of science fiction.After the first episode, things quiet down a bit.  There are no more absurd pizza delivery outfits.  The fights have better explanation and follow-through.  You are exposed to a massive, diverse world of science fiction throughout the series, but it comes in much more manageable doses.It can get a bit dark and serious, but it carries itself lightly throughout most of the series.Animation - 7/10Released in 2002, the series looks good even today.  The action scenes are all fluid, and the character designs are very nice.  I enjoyed all the uniforms and costumes you encounter throughout the series.  If I was to have one complaint, it would be the minimum amount of effort put in the backgrounds.On fanservice... yes, it\'s there, no doubt about it.  There are a few times it\'s a little too blatant (like that terrible first episode), but it doesn\'t really detract from the series overall.  I would go as far as to say many action series have more.Sound - 6/10It\'s really nothing too special, good or bad.  The sub and dub have equally good casts (early Hirano Aya and Monica Rial).  I\'ll push it from a 5 to a 6 since it has a great voice cast for both languages.Characters - 8/10The heroines are Éclair and Lumière, who are given a surprising amount of back story for a series of this nature.  Éclair\'s power is pretty basic: super strength, reflexes, etc.  She\'s a tank.  She is enthusiastic, short tempered, and excitable.  Lumière has the power to take control of electronics, which has some cool applications in the series.  She has a strong love of grape juice and serves as the level headed partner.  They really make a great pair, with a lot of chemistry between them as partners (and maybe more, if your yuri goggles are on tight enough).There is great arc explaining their pasts and how being an agent for the GOTT works.  This is more than can be said for most action driven shows, expecting you to swallow a one dimensional character.  It takes awhile, but the pair becomes well developed.  The same cannot be said of the side cast, but they are interesting enough and perform their roles adequately.  The main pair of villains (who I will not mention due to spoilers) are fleshed out quite a bit as well.Enjoyment - 9/10I feel as though I gradually explained it throughout this longer-than-expected review.  To sum it up:-Great pair of heroines who are well developed and work very well together-Interesting setting once you absorb it-Fun plot that smooths out over time-Creative story tying good action scenes together.Other ThoughtsI\'ve really been rambling long enough, but...Give it a few episodes before making a call.  The first one is pretty over the top, but the series really does deserve a chance.Thanks for reading (this longer than intended) review. ships, pseudo-science, super powers, guns, and panty shots.

I wouldn't say don't watch this show, but if I had to give someone a list of recommendations, it probably wouldn't come to mind. I'll give it credit, at least the series has AN ending, which in my experience is a feat in of itself when it comes to anime. It's a fun show to watch if you can...tolerate some iffy writing (and a great show if you're really into ecchi). Kiddy Grade was surprisingly well on its way to being a &quot;good&quot; anime. The way the quarter end is handled however makes it an average anime at best, and wank material for homo/pedo fetishists at worst.Story:The first episode was a real challenge to sit through. It gave an uneasy impression of a cheap show with overwhelming amounts of pandering and fanservice. There were also a couple of obnoxious things, like the random use of french (to add some much needed class?) and unnecessary slashes in the episode titles. Fortunately, a story eventually does manage to emerge inbetween the gratuitous panty shots and cleavage closeups (oh ho ho!). Unfortunately, Kiddy Grade is another entry on the long list of anime suffering from &quot;Cancerous Writing Syndrome.&quot; They build up this background and plot that almost looks as if it'll be unique and interesting, and then they unleash a beast of such fierce banality (episode 19) that everything gets defenestrated. Why  do so many shows do this? Just when you think there might be something you can take seriously, they either make it redundant or just outright contradict it.I mention this not as an illustration of my disdain for the show so much as my genuine disappointment in it. The use of mystery and sci-fi elements were entertaining enough to keep my interest. I was also fairly amused by the creative use of things like nanobots, lipstick whips and overpowered suitcases. For all their creativity however there was an equal amount (if not more) of ridiculous dialogue, cheesy moments, cliche exposition and other eye-rolling exercises. Still, it's the suicidal deus ex machina towards the end that really ushers in the catastrophic nosedive. The story gets simultaneously insipid and convoluted, and yet despite this dichotomy, it still somehow manages to resolve things in the most generic of fashions. To top this off, the shameless exploitation returns with a perverted vengeance. So... if you don't like the way this show begins, you probably won't like the way it ends either.Characters:There wasn't really much there in terms of characters, they're all kind of cycled through hastily, but I expected as much. I didn't have a problem with any of the characters per se, other than they're all pretty recycled. Here's a rough breakdown: a main character who is the greatest [whatever], a trusty and crafty sidekick, rivalrous friends (or frienemies), a hard-nosed yet kind-at-heart boss, a mysterious yet conveniently helpful guy, and of course the meddling antics of characters who are as good at concealing their alignments as they are at not revealing their diabolical plans.Art:The animation was pretty good. Very similar to Full Metal Panic, which would make sense, since they shared the same animation studio. There were some cool character designs as well. I really liked Eclairs first costume, Tweedle-Dee's china dress was also very nice.Sound:The opening/ending songs actually grew on me O_OAnd I thought the bg music was fine (though perhaps a little too much use of the suspense horn).I have no idea if this show is any better subbed, but here's a sample of the wonderful dialogue from Kiddy Grade (ep. 19):[Two villains are giving chase to the heroines]Villain 1: Where do they think they're going?Villain 2: Nowhere.

Everything about this anime invited me to immediately watch the next episode and the one after and the one after. Too bad it didn't stay that way until the last episode.Story: 6Éclair and Lumière are two girls who work for the GOTT, an organization which takes care of businesses with governments all over the galaxy. These two ES member are the ones standing on the frontlines and as we follow them throughout the story they take care of pretty much everything that stands in their way from accomplishing their goal. While the anime starts...very light-hearted it becomes dark towards the end.The problem with the story is that there are gaps, and quite a lot of them. I kept hoping that they would explain everything at the end of the series, but they didn't.There are these tip-offs about governmental secrets, apart from that you don't get to know much more about them. Same goes for some of the events, mostly in the second half of the series. Though they truly are important events, you never really get to understand them.I don't know what to say about the end. All of the sudden there's this battle of the century (I don't know why though) with every known character interfering. It was random but strangely touching.I'm a bit dissatisfied with the story. It could have been a lot better.Art: 9The art was brilliant. The clothes, hairstyles, scenarios... everything looked very colorful. I also enjoyed the facial expressions. At some points the characters were really touching.The animation was very neat too and the fight-scenes were impressive.I also liked the opening and the ending-scenes. They weren't boring and fitted the spirit of the series.Sound: 8The first thing I noticed when starting Kiddy Grade was the music. A bit old schoolish but enjoyable and a great bonus to every scene. The opening sequence was alright, the ending was very good. The tunes will still stay in my head for a while, which is good.Character: 8Éclair, she's ever excited when they encounter trouble, a bit of a tomboy even. Whereas Lumière is ever elegant and constantly drinking grapefruit juice. The characters were adorable and I immediately felt empathy for both of them.Eclipse, their boss, well... I still don't understand what she's all about. She's one of the gaps I spoke of.There is one thing which really bothered me. Halfway Kiddy Grade both Éclair and Lumière change appearance! It was such a bummer. After this I had a very hard time regaining faith in them, especially because I didn't like their new looks.Enjoyment: 7Though the series has it's flaws it's still quite enjoyable. There's a decent amount of action but that doesn't get in the way of character development. At the beginning it almost looks like a feel-good anime. After a while it gets more dramatic and you get sucked into it along with the characters.It most definitely was fun to watch.Overall: 7It could have been a perfect 10 on 10 anime but the gaps in the plot are just too much of a nuisance. Everything about this anime just screams that it has more potential. Too bad the creators didn't do anything with it.I don't really understand why it says ecchi in the information column.

That said, here\'s my take on the good and bad of the show:Summary: Great soundtrack, emotional appeal (lots of heartwarming moments), interesting story themes.  Plot not sufficiently coherent, and generally tries to do too much.  Also, minor fanservice warning.It\'s great for the following things:* Characterization, especially of Éclair.  Even though I\'m just an ordinary person in the present, and Éclair is a superhero from a space-based future, I felt that I could relate to her and her...feelings very well.  The show really does very well in portraying her emotions and her experiences in a very ""show don\'t tell"" way, and while you\'ll have to consult info-books (or research on the web to learn specific pieces of backstory, I found that I didn\'t really need to know it to feel what she\'s feeling.  For what it\'s worth, I\'ve seen the FUNimation dub starring Colleen Clinkenbeard as Éclair, and she does a wonderful job with her role.* Soundtrack.

They along with 12 others that possess amazing superpowers are a type of police squad that bring down criminals.My thoughts:I truly enjoyed watching Kiddy Grade. The story is engaging. At each episode we learn something new that brings us closer to knowing what GOTT is and who the ES members are. This an anime I will certainly watch again and I look forward to seeing the movies and the second season.Note: I've been looking for the movies and sadly...can't find them anywhere. can't find them anywhere."", ""It’s a tale as old as time, and yet it still takes place in the distant future...  After space on Earth started to become scarce, the human race expanded to the stars, developing the technology to terraform planets and claiming them for the sake of creating brand new civilizations.  As you might imagine, this brought untold chaos at first, as disputes between these super-sized settlements erupted into large scale wars, where an insurmountable number of lives were claimed.  Enter the Galactic Union, an all-powerful government that was formed to stabilize the relationships between these warring worlds and unite all of humanity under...one rule!Enforcing this rule and keeping the peace is the GOTT:  The Global Organization of Trade and Tariffs, and at their beck and call is the loyal ES Taskforce, a small legion of two-person units that take assignments from the Galactic Union and serve and protect the people unified within!  Out of the six known teams, one that stands out is the team of Eclaire and Lumiere, a chipper teenage brunette and an elegant little girl with a blue braid.  They don’t look like much, especially when they’re pulling off their second job as corporate receptionists, but if you commit evil deeds while they’re on call, you’ll have to deal with one of the most intimidating duos in the galaxy.  They’re more than meets the eye, and as the shadowy secrets about their employers start to come to light, the galaxy will soon learn what it means to underestimate them.I haven’t ever discussed Studio Gonzo, have I?  I mean, I wrote up a Gantz review several years ago, but that was LONG before I actually learned how to write reviews.  Well, that’s never seeing the light of day, so I guess my intro to all things Gonzo will take the form of the apparently immortal 2002 classic sci-fi series Kiddy Grade.  Now, with your typical Studio Gonzo production, you can expect it to fall on one of two sides of the scale...  It’ll either have gorgeous high-budget animation, or dirt-cheap animation that does it’s damnedest to appear as visually pleasing as possible.  Kiddy Grade falls very securely on the low side of the scale, but they’ve made a LOT worse looking shows than this.Yes, I should get this out of the way right now...  The fact that it had a low budget couldn’t be more obvious if it was on the street pan-handling.  Key frames...  AKA, moments when there’s no action on screen other than mouth flaps, brief bursts of movement and embarrassing motion loops...  Are everywhere.  Even at their scarcest, they’re in every other scene at least.  Thankfully, these issues never pop up during the action scenes, so while it’s not a good look per se, it’s somewhat excusable considering how cleverly Gonzo was able to portray the femme fatales kicking villainous ass without having to sacrifice frame rates to compensate it.  There’s a lot of CG used for the characters’ space ships and guardian mech robots, and while it doesn’t really mesh with the 2D animation style of the rest of the series, it’s not too bad on it’s own merits.While the animation is relatively good, at least compared to other Gonzo shows of it’s time, the artwork is a lot stronger.  The color palette is bright and diverse, standing out beautifully against the backgrounds, most of which are monotonous and gritty with realistic wear.  That’s not to say the backgrounds are never impressive, as there are some very appealing outdoor scenes, but the dullness of spaceship interiors and even space itself complements the characters nicely.  The character designs are diverse almost to a fault, as each pair of ES members looks increasingly unique to the point that I could imagine them being pulled out of the sketchbook of a caffeine addict on a 5 Hour Energy binge.  Simply put, with it’s highly distinctive art style, there are no other characters that look like Kiddy Grade characters.The music is made up mostly of electronic tunes, meant to convey the spacey, futuristic feel of the show, and does so in an ambitious fashion.  The soundtrack was fairly new for it’s time, but looking back at it fourteen years later, it’s been done a lot better since then, causing what was once a unique sound to feel kind of generic to our spoiled ears.  The opening, on the other hand is a lot more standard, and was probably considered generic even back in 2002.  Setting aside the video for a moment, you have two options with this opening...  A dubbed version and a subbed version.  I’ve heard countless people recommend the sub, but is it that much better?  The singing is definitely louder and more confidant, but it opens on a pair of cringe-worthy Engrish lines that sound awkward in both pronunciation and wording.  The dubbed version fixes this problem, which earns it some points, but it also features a far duller-sounding singer, and the lyrics...  Like most anime theme lyrics...  Do not translate well to English.  I want to recommend the subbed version really badly, but those damn opening lines, though...The Ending theme, in both languages, is a much more pleasant listen.The English dub is from the very early stages of Funimation, and as such it shows a lot of quirks from that period of Funi’s existence.  There are plenty of names in it that you really don’t see as much anymore, such as Dameon Clarke, Scarlett McAllister, Gwendoline Lau, Rebecca Paige, John Myron, Antimere Robinson...  Just a ton of names that either haven’t worked in years or only had a brief stint in anime, and for the most part, none of them are really that impressive here.  The exception of course is Demeon Clarke as the shady auditor Armblast, but even this role is a far cry from the acting chops he showed as the original Scar in FMA.  There are a few modern names sprinkled throughout, such as Eric Vale, Vic Mignona, Alison Victorin in her debut role, Chris Sabat doing a pretty sweet European accent, and Clarine Harp doing something other than DVD design, and yeah, they’re all really good...  But none of them can touch Colleen Clinkenbeard and Monica Rial in the lead roles.Monica Rial is probably one of the most well known voice actors in the business.  Her name is almost guaranteed to be on any anime fan’s favorite actor list, and for good reason.  She’s a consistently good performer, and has been ever since her first day on the job.  In contrast, a name I see disturbingly little of on those lists is Colleen Clinkenbeard, who may actually be the most under-rated and taken-for-granted performer in the industry.  Kiddy Grade was her debut not only as an actor, but as an ADR director, and while I’m disappointed to say both jobs amounted to some rough results in the beginning of the show...  The acting was somewhat underwhelming, voices weren’t always matching the lip flaps...  It improved rapidly on both counts towards the middle, showing off a lot of the latent talent that she had both in and out of the booth.Yes, the dub takes a while to get off of it’s feet, but that's mainly due to the growing pains of a duel first timer.  Colleen has proven herself since then to be a highly respectful director and writer who can easily navigate the minefield of localizing a dub without bastardizing it, and has shown in several instances that she can hit all the slanginess of a Jamie Marchi dub without suffering from any of the tasteless Jamie Marchi excess.  As an actor, she’s shown a surprising consistency across a wide range of voices, giving her a chameleon quality that can make her very difficult to pick out, even when she’s playing a bubbly and upbeat character like Eclair.  Pair her with fellow veterans Monica Rial and Lauira Bailey, and you’ve got a dub that’s pretty damn good at it’s best moments.  It’s not necessarily better than the sub, but if you’re looking for a time capsule of early-2000’s Funimation, I highly recommend it.Okay, so, let’s set aside my earlier plot synopsis for a second and go over what this show’s really about.  Kiddy Grade is the story of two femme fatale law enforcers with charisma and power to spare.  One is a hacker that can manipulate and even astral-project herself into any kind of computer system or machine, and the other has super-speed, super strength, and a tube of lipstick that can turn into a razor-sharp whip.  They work for a supposedly benevolent organization, but corruption in the upper ranks forces them into political conflicts where they eventually have to engage in space battles and mecha fights against their peers and coworkers.while gradually revealing their own troubled past.Why am I bringing this up?  Because Kiddy Grade has one of the most awesome sounding premises I’ve ever heard.  I don’t know a single person who could hear it and not immediately put it on their “to-watch” list.  It’s a title that’s endured in the popular conscience for 14 years without fading into obscurity, so one would naturally assume it to be of some quality, or at least a sizeable fanbase willing to overlook any problems it might have.  And yet, when I go on Facebook to say it hasn’t aged well, I’m met not with anger, but likes.  When I complain about some details that don’t fit right in retrospect, I get responses pointing out MORE inconsistencies related to the plot over-all before anybody comes in to defend it.  Keep in mind, this is happening in very similar fan groups to the two that I got booted out of for talking shit about Guilty Crown, so where’s the flame war over this?  And while we’re on the subject, why can’t I watch more than a few episodes at a time without pausing to do chores?To answer this question, I’m going to be dissecting three specific episodes of the show.  Depending on how high their respective ep. numbers are, I’ll be using different amount of detail and spoilers for each one.  First up, let’s take a look at episode five, Day/Off.  I’m going to be running down the entire episode in detail, but don’t worry...  This isn’t Cowboy Bebop, here.  Important spoilers don’t happen until much later.To start, Eclaire and Lumiere have the day off from work, so they each decide to spend it differently.  Eclair goes out drinking with a friend, and Lumiere goes to the opera.  Sounds like a great set-up for some one-on-one character development, right?  Well, let’s see what happens.  An employee at the club approaches Eclaire, commenting that she looks too young to be in there.  His manager comes along and says that he’s new, and not to bother the lady...  Not because she's an ES member, mind you, but just because “kicking people out makes us look bad.”  Which makes no sense, because serving alcohol to minors definitely looks worse.  She dances with a guy, and when he tries to kiss her, she shoves him through the air and into the table where two criminal organizations are making a deal.  They both assume the attack was orchestrated by the other side, which doesn’t make sense, because who plans to have a human being thrown at their table?  Even Monty Python wouldn’t come up with a strategy that absurd.On her way to the opera, Lumiere hears a lonely little girl crying behind some bushes.  The little girl kisses her and puts her into a trance so some big men can abduct her.  Which makes no sense, because didn’t we just see Eclaire successfully fend off a kiss from a much larger man?  Why would her partner just stand there and let it happen?  Lumiere wakes up in a storage room with a bunch of other kids who were abducted as well.  Which makes no sense because are there really that many kids walking to the opera alone that she just happened to be one of them?  Seeing how quickly she escapes her bindings, its fairly obvious they didn’t know about her power, so it would have to be random, right?  And how was the trap girl immune to her own lipstick?The crime organization recruits Eclaire to work on a mission to pay off her debt to them...  Which makes no sense, because not only should she have bolted during the confusion, but they were the ones who misconstrued a clutzy coincidence...  And she winds up face to face with the ship that her partner has just killed the pilots and taken control of, which makes no sense because not only is she supposed to be elegant, or because an agent who needs permission to make arrests shouldn’t be able to kill so easily, but because coincidence is the tool of lazy writers.  Anyway, this leaves a lot of unconscious kids to be returned home, but as it turns out, Lumiere has found an on-board computer with a database of the names of all the abducted kids, past and present.  This makes no sense because A:  Why would they keep a record of kids they don’t have anymore?  B:  Why would they need a record of ANY of their names?  C:  If they’re using it for ransom purposes, they must know names of the kids before trapping them, so why go after Lumiere, who doesn’t come from a rich family?  D:  What about the honeypot kid?  Is she a robot?  Was she brainwashed?  Did they rescue her as well, or was her part in the story done once the audience got their yuri-loli tease?If you’re having trouble pinning down my first specific complaint, count up the amount of times I said “Didn’t/doesn’t make any sense” in the space of one single episode.  This isn’t an exception, but the rule.  The entire series is like that.  Out of almost ninety percent of the things that happen in this series, none of it makes any sense.  It’s either poorly explained or it won’t be explained until later.  Characters make decisions that are not only stupid, but baffling in terms of the logic they use, forming plans that are either overly-complicated or horribly misguided, or both.  The freaking white rabbit is easier to follow than this series is at most points.  Even an issue as basic as what the characters are becomes confusing.  They are just humans with nanomachines prolonging their lives, right?  Well how the hell can their consciousness jump into new bodies?  A brain transplant?  Are they robots?For my second point, let’s take a somewhat more vague look at episode 14, Steel/Heart.  A thing happens in this episode, and while I won’t go into specifics about who, how or why, two of Eclair and Lumiere’s closest allies are...  Um, I know this isn't the right word, but I’ll say “Brainwashed” to avoid spoiling too much...  to kill them.  Our heroes fight valiantly, but are unable to save themselves without destroying their friends.  Now, this should be an emotional moment, yes?  There should be feels here, but alas, there are none to be had.  I can’t stress enough how important hope is when you’re trying to write a tragedy.  In order for a character’s death to make an impact on the viewer, there has to be some sort of hope that they’ll survive, but no, as soon as the “brainwashing” takes place, they might as well have put a big countdown timer on the screen, because we’re never given any indication that our heroes can do anything but delay the inevitable.And furthermore, their death doesn't have any feeling of weight to it because despite their constant presence in the story, we’re only given one highly forgettable episode to suggest that they even WERE characters to begin with.  But then again, that’s only about half as much time as any other supporting character is given, so why not?  There is a huge cast of characters in Kiddy Grade, and while they’re wildly diverse in terms of appearance and powers, they just have jack shit in terms of personality.  Oh, they have quirks...  There’s a sibling team where the sister refuses to let her brother call her ‘sister’ on the clock, and there’s a child/adult team that’s always arguing about where to eat, and...  Other...  Teams...  And that’s about as far as any of them go.  All-in-all, the actions of any given team could easily be swapped out with the actions of any other given team.Even the two main characters fail to leave much of an impression.  Lumiere is probably the most interesting character in the cast, as she can at least claim to be elegant and have refined tastes, but she quickly turns that into a gimmick by constantly saying “A lady should be more elegant.”  She’s the precocious loli, which is more of a trope than a trait.  Eclaire is of course the main character, so by the tradition of lazy writing, she has to be the perfectly righteous and idealistic hero.  She’s a martyr waiting to happen, and it gets annoying really fast.  There’s at least one villain who shows promise, but her motives seem confused between altruism and misanthropy.  The Noblesse, who are supposed to be the true villains of the show, are native-born Earthlings, and they are nothing...  I repeat, nothing...  But upper-crust snobs with sticks up their asses and a contempt for all people lower than them.Speaking of the noblesse, my final example isn’t so much an episode as a plot twist that happens towards the end of the series.  I won’t spoil it, but it’s the first step in what might be a huge downfall for the Noblesse, and it has a lot in common with April O’neal’s expanded connection to the Ninja Turtles that was revealed in the latest TMNT movie.  Only in this case, it’s like the turtles were absent and just barely eluded to for four-fifths of the story before coming in like an exposition wrecking ball to tie everything together.  Oh, and you’ll also have to imagine that April’s been firmly established to have a lot more important things to do than play nanny through the formative years of a bunch of freaking turtles.  Seriously, these are supposed to be warriors with respectable authority, why the hell was one of them on nurse-maid duty?  And it’s this final little twist...  One that even Shyamalan would have sent back to the drawing board...  That proves just how terribly, terribly written this anime is.The series attempts, at about the halfway point, to explain how all of the events that happened up until that point were part of one interconnected plot, and it’s delivered through status reports to the chief of the GOTT.  There are two problems with this, the first of which being that the explanation grinds the pace to a complete halt, and rather than sounding like a canon summary of events, it sounds more like an imaginative fanboy on Reddit tying to connect all the Pixar movies together.  The stretching is that bad.  Second of all, when you really look at it, this one episode gives away the one thing the creators of Kiddy Grade had been going through all of this BS to try to accomplish.Yes, there was a legitimate goal in mind, here.  These writers had an agenda, and once you start making the comparisons, it’s kind of embarrassing what they were trying to do;  They were trying really hard to make Kiddy Grade the Evangelion of it’s genre.  That entire sequence was a callback to an episode of Evangelion where the Angels that had been defeated thus far were listed off in a similar report.  The narrative is constantly pushing meaningless religious symbolism, like the concept of sacrifice and rebirth, crucifixes, and hell, the organization our cast works for is called Gott, the German word for God.  An entire episode is spent on Eclair trying to pull herself together psychologically after a random flashback brought out some erased memories, and the episode is a laughable attempt to copy the mental depth of a show that wasn’t all that deep in the first place.So after all that, why is this show so well remembered?  Why has it thrived for so long in the public consciousness, when all of the best things it has to offer are now dated?  How does a combination of pathos, faux complexity and poorly directed fanservice demand so much name recognition in today’s market?  Well, it all comes down to Kiddy Grade’s sense of style.  I can’t think of any anime before or after this one that had the same kind of aesthetic to it.  People like things that are unique, and that’s one word I can definitely apply to Kiddy Grade.  It fails to tell a good story, it fails to build good characters, and in the end, all it really has to offer is spectacle of two good looking girls kicking ass, like it’s the pretentious version of Dirty Pair...  Which is all some people want, I guess.Kiddy Grade is available from Funimation.  It was originally released stateside in an 8-disk box set that, despite the hefty price even then, came with a pretty attractive set of trading cards based around the eye-catch artwork of the episodes.  If you’re looking for something cheaper, they did recently release the series in Anime classic thinpack form for a much more reasonable price.  There have been three movies that were meant to retell the story of the series, but they haven’t been released stateside...  After nine years and counting, I think you can give up waiting any day now.  There have also been a handful of light novels and manga serials, but these have also sadly not seen the light of day on our side of the ocean.While Kiddy Grade is a clusterfuck of failed story-telling, with a title that more than describes the level of maturity that went into it, I honestly can’t say I hated it.  It didn’t make me feel angry or insulted, nor did it ever make me feel bored.  Than again, I’m going to attribute those points to the fact that it just didn’t make me feel anything, positive or negative.  It’s not that bad a show to watch if you don’t mind having your brain turned blissfuilly off the whole time, but as I’ve said many times before, I refuse to do that.  Then again, with or without my approval, it’s an anime that’s survived for almost a decade and a half, and through whatever black magic it’s strange title has been casting, I’m pretty sure it’s here to stay.  I give Kiddy Grade a 4/10. one rule!Enforcing this rule and keeping the peace is the GOTT:  The Global Organization of Trade and Tariffs, and at their beck and call is the loyal ES Taskforce, a small legion of two-person units that take assignments from the Galactic Union and serve and protect the people unified within!  Out of the six known teams, one that stands out is the team of Eclaire and Lumiere, a chipper teenage brunette and an elegant little girl with a blue braid.  They don’t look like much, especially when they’re pulling off their second job as corporate receptionists, but if you commit evil deeds while they’re on call, you’ll have to deal with one of the most intimidating duos in the galaxy.  They’re more than meets the eye, and as the shadowy secrets about their employers start to come to light, the galaxy will soon learn what it means to underestimate them.I haven’t ever discussed Studio Gonzo, have I?  I mean, I wrote up a Gantz review several years ago, but that was LONG before I actually learned how to write reviews.  Well, that’s never seeing the light of day, so I guess my intro to all things Gonzo will take the form of the apparently immortal 2002 classic sci-fi series Kiddy Grade.  Now, with your typical Studio Gonzo production, you can expect it to fall on one of two sides of the scale...  It’ll either have gorgeous high-budget animation, or dirt-cheap animation that does it’s damnedest to appear as visually pleasing as possible.  Kiddy Grade falls very securely on the low side of the scale, but they’ve made a LOT worse looking shows than this.Yes, I should get this out of the way right now...  The fact that it had a low budget couldn’t be more obvious if it was on the street pan-handling.  Key frames...  AKA, moments when there’s no action on screen other than mouth flaps, brief bursts of movement and embarrassing motion loops...  Are everywhere.  Even at their scarcest, they’re in every other scene at least.  Thankfully, these issues never pop up during the action scenes, so while it’s not a good look per se, it’s somewhat excusable considering how cleverly Gonzo was able to portray the femme fatales kicking villainous ass without having to sacrifice frame rates to compensate it.  There’s a lot of CG used for the characters’ space ships and guardian mech robots, and while it doesn’t really mesh with the 2D animation style of the rest of the series, it’s not too bad on it’s own merits.While the animation is relatively good, at least compared to other Gonzo shows of it’s time, the artwork is a lot stronger.  The color palette is bright and diverse, standing out beautifully against the backgrounds, most of which are monotonous and gritty with realistic wear.  That’s not to say the backgrounds are never impressive, as there are some very appealing outdoor scenes, but the dullness of spaceship interiors and even space itself complements the characters nicely.  The character designs are diverse almost to a fault, as each pair of ES members looks increasingly unique to the point that I could imagine them being pulled out of the sketchbook of a caffeine addict on a 5 Hour Energy binge.  Simply put, with it’s highly distinctive art style, there are no other characters that look like Kiddy Grade characters.The music is made up mostly of electronic tunes, meant to convey the spacey, futuristic feel of the show, and does so in an ambitious fashion.  The soundtrack was fairly new for it’s time, but looking back at it fourteen years later, it’s been done a lot better since then, causing what was once a unique sound to feel kind of generic to our spoiled ears.  The opening, on the other hand is a lot more standard, and was probably considered generic even back in 2002.  Setting aside the video for a moment, you have two options with this opening...  A dubbed version and a subbed version.  I’ve heard countless people recommend the sub, but is it that much better?  The singing is definitely louder and more confidant, but it opens on a pair of cringe-worthy Engrish lines that sound awkward in both pronunciation and wording.  The dubbed version fixes this problem, which earns it some points, but it also features a far duller-sounding singer, and the lyrics...  Like most anime theme lyrics...  Do not translate well to English.  I want to recommend the subbed version really badly, but those damn opening lines, though...The Ending theme, in both languages, is a much more pleasant listen.The English dub is from the very early stages of Funimation, and as such it shows a lot of quirks from that period of Funi’s existence.  There are plenty of names in it that you really don’t see as much anymore, such as Dameon Clarke, Scarlett McAllister, Gwendoline Lau, Rebecca Paige, John Myron, Antimere Robinson...

There are a few modern names sprinkled throughout, such as Eric Vale, Vic Mignona, Alison Victorin in her debut role, Chris Sabat doing a pretty sweet European accent, and Clarine Harp doing something other than DVD design, and yeah, they’re all really good...  But none of them can touch Colleen Clinkenbeard and Monica Rial in the lead roles.Monica Rial is probably one of the most well known voice actors in the business.  Her name is almost guaranteed to be on any anime fan’s favorite actor list, and for good reason.  She’s a consistently good performer, and has been ever since her first day on the job.  In contrast, a name I see disturbingly little of on those lists is Colleen Clinkenbeard, who may actually be the most under-rated and taken-for-granted performer in the industry.  Kiddy Grade was her debut not only as an actor, but as an ADR director, and while I’m disappointed to say both jobs amounted to some rough results in the beginning of the show...

As an actor, she’s shown a surprising consistency across a wide range of voices, giving her a chameleon quality that can make her very difficult to pick out, even when she’s playing a bubbly and upbeat character like Eclair.  Pair her with fellow veterans Monica Rial and Lauira Bailey, and you’ve got a dub that’s pretty damn good at it’s best moments.  It’s not necessarily better than the sub, but if you’re looking for a time capsule of early-2000’s Funimation, I highly recommend it.Okay, so, let’s set aside my earlier plot synopsis for a second and go over what this show’s really about.  Kiddy Grade is the story of two femme fatale law enforcers with charisma and power to spare.  One is a hacker that can manipulate and even astral-project herself into any kind of computer system or machine, and the other has super-speed, super strength, and a tube of lipstick that can turn into a razor-sharp whip.  They work for a supposedly benevolent organization, but corruption in the upper ranks forces them into political conflicts where they eventually have to engage in space battles and mecha fights against their peers and coworkers.while gradually revealing their own troubled past.Why am I bringing this up?  Because Kiddy Grade has one of the most awesome sounding premises I’ve ever heard.  I don’t know a single person who could hear it and not immediately put it on their “to-watch” list.  It’s a title that’s endured in the popular conscience for 14 years without fading into obscurity, so one would naturally assume it to be of some quality, or at least a sizeable fanbase willing to overlook any problems it might have.  And yet, when I go on Facebook to say it hasn’t aged well, I’m met not with anger, but likes.  When I complain about some details that don’t fit right in retrospect, I get responses pointing out MORE inconsistencies related to the plot over-all before anybody comes in to defend it.  Keep in mind, this is happening in very similar fan groups to the two that I got booted out of for talking shit about Guilty Crown, so where’s the flame war over this?  And while we’re on the subject, why can’t I watch more than a few episodes at a time without pausing to do chores?To answer this question, I’m going to be dissecting three specific episodes of the show.  Depending on how high their respective ep. numbers are, I’ll be using different amount of detail and spoilers for each one.  First up, let’s take a look at episode five, Day/Off.  I’m going to be running down the entire episode in detail, but don’t worry...  This isn’t Cowboy Bebop, here.  Important spoilers don’t happen until much later.To start, Eclaire and Lumiere have the day off from work, so they each decide to spend it differently.  Eclair goes out drinking with a friend, and Lumiere goes to the opera.  Sounds like a great set-up for some one-on-one character development, right?  Well, let’s see what happens.  An employee at the club approaches Eclaire, commenting that she looks too young to be in there.  His manager comes along and says that he’s new, and not to bother the lady...  Not because she's an ES member, mind you, but just because “kicking people out makes us look bad.”  Which makes no sense, because serving alcohol to minors definitely looks worse.  She dances with a guy, and when he tries to kiss her, she shoves him through the air and into the table where two criminal organizations are making a deal.  They both assume the attack was orchestrated by the other side, which doesn’t make sense, because who plans to have a human being thrown at their table?  Even Monty Python wouldn’t come up with a strategy that absurd.On her way to the opera, Lumiere hears a lonely little girl crying behind some bushes.  The little girl kisses her and puts her into a trance so some big men can abduct her.  Which makes no sense, because didn’t we just see Eclaire successfully fend off a kiss from a much larger man?  Why would her partner just stand there and let it happen?  Lumiere wakes up in a storage room with a bunch of other kids who were abducted as well.  Which makes no sense because are there really that many kids walking to the opera alone that she just happened to be one of them?  Seeing how quickly she escapes her bindings, its fairly obvious they didn’t know about her power, so it would have to be random, right?  And how was the trap girl immune to her own lipstick?The crime organization recruits Eclaire to work on a mission to pay off her debt to them...  Which makes no sense, because not only should she have bolted during the confusion, but they were the ones who misconstrued a clutzy coincidence...  And she winds up face to face with the ship that her partner has just killed the pilots and taken control of, which makes no sense because not only is she supposed to be elegant, or because an agent who needs permission to make arrests shouldn’t be able to kill so easily, but because coincidence is the tool of lazy writers.  Anyway, this leaves a lot of unconscious kids to be returned home, but as it turns out, Lumiere has found an on-board computer with a database of the names of all the abducted kids, past and present.  This makes no sense because A:  Why would they keep a record of kids they don’t have anymore?  B:  Why would they need a record of ANY of their names?  C:  If they’re using it for ransom purposes, they must know names of the kids before trapping them, so why go after Lumiere, who doesn’t come from a rich family?  D:  What about the honeypot kid?  Is she a robot?  Was she brainwashed?  Did they rescue her as well, or was her part in the story done once the audience got their yuri-loli tease?If you’re having trouble pinning down my first specific complaint, count up the amount of times I said “Didn’t/doesn’t make any sense” in the space of one single episode.  This isn’t an exception, but the rule.  The entire series is like that.  Out of almost ninety percent of the things that happen in this series, none of it makes any sense.  It’s either poorly explained or it won’t be explained until later.  Characters make decisions that are not only stupid, but baffling in terms of the logic they use, forming plans that are either overly-complicated or horribly misguided, or both.  The freaking white rabbit is easier to follow than this series is at most points.  Even an issue as basic as what the characters are becomes confusing.  They are just humans with nanomachines prolonging their lives, right?  Well how the hell can their consciousness jump into new bodies?  A brain transplant?  Are they robots?For my second point, let’s take a somewhat more vague look at episode 14, Steel/Heart.  A thing happens in this episode, and while I won’t go into specifics about who, how or why, two of Eclair and Lumiere’s closest allies are...  Um, I know this isn't the right word, but I’ll say “Brainwashed” to avoid spoiling too much...  to kill them.  Our heroes fight valiantly, but are unable to save themselves without destroying their friends.  Now, this should be an emotional moment, yes?  There should be feels here, but alas, there are none to be had.  I can’t stress enough how important hope is when you’re trying to write a tragedy.  In order for a character’s death to make an impact on the viewer, there has to be some sort of hope that they’ll survive, but no, as soon as the “brainwashing” takes place, they might as well have put a big countdown timer on the screen, because we’re never given any indication that our heroes can do anything but delay the inevitable.And furthermore, their death doesn't have any feeling of weight to it because despite their constant presence in the story, we’re only given one highly forgettable episode to suggest that they even WERE characters to begin with.  But then again, that’s only about half as much time as any other supporting character is given, so why not?  There is a huge cast of characters in Kiddy Grade, and while they’re wildly diverse in terms of appearance and powers, they just have jack shit in terms of personality.  Oh, they have quirks...  There’s a sibling team where the sister refuses to let her brother call her ‘sister’ on the clock, and there’s a child/adult team that’s always arguing about where to eat, and...  Other...  Teams...  And that’s about as far as any of them go.  All-in-all, the actions of any given team could easily be swapped out with the actions of any other given team.Even the two main characters fail to leave much of an impression.  Lumiere is probably the most interesting character in the cast, as she can at least claim to be elegant and have refined tastes, but she quickly turns that into a gimmick by constantly saying “A lady should be more elegant.”  She’s the precocious loli, which is more of a trope than a trait.  Eclaire is of course the main character, so by the tradition of lazy writing, she has to be the perfectly righteous and idealistic hero.  She’s a martyr waiting to happen, and it gets annoying really fast.  There’s at least one villain who shows promise, but her motives seem confused between altruism and misanthropy.  The Noblesse, who are supposed to be the true villains of the show, are native-born Earthlings, and they are nothing...  I repeat, nothing...  But upper-crust snobs with sticks up their asses and a contempt for all people lower than them.Speaking of the noblesse, my final example isn’t so much an episode as a plot twist that happens towards the end of the series.  I won’t spoil it, but it’s the first step in what might be a huge downfall for the Noblesse, and it has a lot in common with April O’neal’s expanded connection to the Ninja Turtles that was revealed in the latest TMNT movie.  Only in this case, it’s like the turtles were absent and just barely eluded to for four-fifths of the story before coming in like an exposition wrecking ball to tie everything together.  Oh, and you’ll also have to imagine that April’s been firmly established to have a lot more important things to do than play nanny through the formative years of a bunch of freaking turtles.  Seriously, these are supposed to be warriors with respectable authority, why the hell was one of them on nurse-maid duty?  And it’s this final little twist...  One that even Shyamalan would have sent back to the drawing board...  That proves just how terribly, terribly written this anime is.The series attempts, at about the halfway point, to explain how all of the events that happened up until that point were part of one interconnected plot, and it’s delivered through status reports to the chief of the GOTT.  There are two problems with this, the first of which being that the explanation grinds the pace to a complete halt, and rather than sounding like a canon summary of events, it sounds more like an imaginative fanboy on Reddit tying to connect all the Pixar movies together.  The stretching is that bad.  Second of all, when you really look at it, this one episode gives away the one thing the creators of Kiddy Grade had been going through all of this BS to try to accomplish.Yes, there was a legitimate goal in mind, here.  These writers had an agenda, and once you start making the comparisons, it’s kind of embarrassing what they were trying to do;  They were trying really hard to make Kiddy Grade the Evangelion of it’s genre.  That entire sequence was a callback to an episode of Evangelion where the Angels that had been defeated thus far were listed off in a similar report.  The narrative is constantly pushing meaningless religious symbolism, like the concept of sacrifice and rebirth, crucifixes, and hell, the organization our cast works for is called Gott, the German word for God.  An entire episode is spent on Eclair trying to pull herself together psychologically after a random flashback brought out some erased memories, and the episode is a laughable attempt to copy the mental depth of a show that wasn’t all that deep in the first place.So after all that, why is this show so well remembered?  Why has it thrived for so long in the public consciousness, when all of the best things it has to offer are now dated?  How does a combination of pathos, faux complexity and poorly directed fanservice demand so much name recognition in today’s market?  Well, it all comes down to Kiddy Grade’s sense of style.  I can’t think of any anime before or after this one that had the same kind of aesthetic to it.  People like things that are unique, and that’s one word I can definitely apply to Kiddy Grade.  It fails to tell a good story, it fails to build good characters, and in the end, all it really has to offer is spectacle of two good looking girls kicking ass, like it’s the pretentious version of Dirty Pair...  Which is all some people want, I guess.Kiddy Grade is available from Funimation.  It was originally released stateside in an 8-disk box set that, despite the hefty price even then, came with a pretty attractive set of trading cards based around the eye-catch artwork of the episodes.  If you’re looking for something cheaper, they did recently release the series in Anime classic thinpack form for a much more reasonable price.  There have been three movies that were meant to retell the story of the series, but they haven’t been released stateside...  After nine years and counting, I think you can give up waiting any day now.  There have also been a handful of light novels and manga serials, but these have also sadly not seen the light of day on our side of the ocean.While Kiddy Grade is a clusterfuck of failed story-telling, with a title that more than describes the level of maturity that went into it, I honestly can’t say I hated it.  It didn’t make me feel angry or insulted, nor did it ever make me feel bored.  Than again, I’m going to attribute those points to the fact that it just didn’t make me feel anything, positive or negative.  It’s not that bad a show to watch if you don’t mind having your brain turned blissfuilly off the whole time, but as I’ve said many times before, I refuse to do that.  Then again, with or without my approval, it’s an anime that’s survived for almost a decade and a half, and through whatever black magic it’s strange title has been casting, I’m pretty sure it’s here to stay.  I give Kiddy Grade a 4/10."", ""This is my First review! Lets get right down to it, shall we? Kiddy Grade is a action packed outer space, futuristic based anime.

And when all hope seemed lost of how everything was going at its ridiculous pace, the upcoming Season 2 announcement straight from AnimeJapan 2023 comes to up the ante, and frankly, I couldn\'t be more happier that High Card is getting more content to finish up it\'s supposed ""first half"" of the story in this season. But let\'s back things up.High Card may be an original anime at first sight, but...it\'s actually a mixed-media project from the minds of Homura Kawamoto, Hikaru Muno, and TMS Entertainment, with collaboration with anime producer Kadokawa and pachinko/pachislot developer Sammy Corporation. Though you will know that TMS Entertainment is the main studio of backing, one name in particular will stand out. And that person is mangaka Homura Kawamoto, the author of Kakegurui, which if you\'ve seen the MAPPA-produced shows of the TV series comprising 2 seasons back in Summer 2017 and Winter 2019, plus the Kakegurui Twin spin-off that was recently released on Netflix last August, you\'ll know that Homura Kawamoto is famous (or infamous, rather) for his over-the-top edgy, psychological thriller impulse that the gambling series is known for. And said gambling creator is back again in his new endeavour: the multimedia franchise that is High Card, with the project\'s focus showcasing the poker motif throughout the series, similar to the gambling theme in Kakegurui, with everything from the title to the names of fictional locations referencing some form of playing card game. And he\'s not alone, for Hikaru Muno, Kawamoto\'s brother and author of the Kakegurui LNs, has also joined him in the project, while TMS Entertainment will oversee the project with the illustrator Ebimo, who developed the character designs. And oh my gawd, it looks goddamn nice and striking.As compared to Kakegurui\'s school setting where the gambling takes place, High Card takes the typical Japanese school out of context, throws that onto the garbage bin, and injects a world that wherever people go, lives are at stake. That\'s because the series revolves around a special secret deck of 52 cards called “X-Playing Cards”, held by the mysterious Kingdom of Fourland\'s royal family. And as discoveries come and go, each card in the deck gives its owner (or “Player”) a very specific superhuman power or ability to whoever uses them. Some cards for example, gives its Player the ability to turn anything he touches into marbles, or extreme luck. And if this reminds you of the Kingsman franchise, then good, it’s supposed to. Kawamoto and Muno put their foot on the forefront that their series is heavily inspired by said movie franchise, with the idea being to create something that would appeal to global audiences. That’s also why they chose to set the series outside of Japan – a globe-trotting series, introducing characters from different cultures.The lead protagonist of High Card is Finn Oldman, a scrumpy young lad trying to raise funds for his orphanage before their heartless landlord clears them out of the building. Undetermined to have his spirit be broken for the orphaned children, he hitches a ride to the imitation of the Las Vegas casino to steal money from unsuspecting rich people so that he could pay up and make his Sun Fields Orphanage live to see another day. But rather than money, Finn suddenly gets involved in his own thievery that he didn\'t expect to be larger than life: a playing card that involves not the stake of money, but of lives. And with explosive suddenness, he gets embroiled in the battle over the X-Playing Cards, which the cards were before, stolen not too long ago and scattered across the land. Being armed with this, he becomes affiliated with High Card, the special private intelligence service group tasked by the King of Fourland to recover all 52 cards, while working undercover as salesmen for the luxurious Pinochle car company.The correlation of both High Card and Kingsman can be defined as such:Finn Oldman is the Gold Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, a skilled pickpocket with great eyesight and focus allowing him to think multiple steps ahead, wielding the 2 of Spades with the ability of ""Neo New Nambu,"" which summons a loaded Nambu revolver into his hand, and can also summon extra bullets into his free hand.Chris Redgrave is the Red Harry ""Galahad"" Hart, a flirty womanizer and skilled driver with a sweet tooth, wielding the 5 of Hearts with the ability of ""Calorie\'s High"", allowing him to convert excess calories to heal injuries instantly that would otherwise prove fatal.Leo Constantine Pinochle is the Navy Blue Chester ""Arthur"" King, the 14-year-old son of Pinochle\'s CEO Theodore Constantine Pinochle, being the manager of the Old Maid branch office, with an abrasive demeanor that often grates on his colleagues. However, his position in society and his money puts him at the top of High Card, considering that his father is also the head of High Card, working directly under the King of Fourland. He wields the 7 of Diamonds with the ability of ""Never No Dollars"", that allows him to instantly swap any amount of money physically nearby for an object of equivalent value. He\'s constantly tapped together with his butler Bernard Symons: he is Merlin, the administrator for High Card, who does everything from serving tea to servicing cars at Pinochle\'s Old Maid branch.Wendy Sato is the Grey Roxanne ""Roxy"" Morton, the daughter of a master swordsman from the Far East, and the accountant for Pinochle\'s Old Maid branch office. She wields the Ace of Spades with the ability of ""Love and Peace,"" a large sword with a mind of its own that summons her sadistic side, and goes away once the power is under control.Vijay Kumar Singh is the Green James ""Lancelot"" Spencer, the highly intelligent PhD student at the University of Cribbage and the system manager-cum-cook at Pinochle\'s Old Maid office, with his aloof personality making him difficult to approach people. He wields the 3 of Clubs, with the power ""Green Green,"" allowing him to communicate with nearby plants and control them.Pinochle has no short of enemies, ranging from threats from rival car company ""Who\'s Who"" seeking to crush Pinochle, to the Klondike mafia family who wants the X-Playing cards for their own nefarious ends. And it\'s people like these that get in their way:Norman Kingstadt, the flamboyant and charismatic CEO of ""Who\'s Who"" in a one-sided rivalry with his childhood friend Theodore. He is aided by Blist Blitz Broadhurst, his personal secretary and bodyguard, who prefers to keep a strictly professional attitude while on the job, constantly reminding the charismatic CEO about pay and labour regulations even as he works to collect X-Playing cards for him. Blist is also a Player, wielding the 10 of Clubs with the ability of ""Million Volt,"" which lets him channel electricity through his body.Ban Klondike is the Dark antagonist Richmond Valentine, the head of the Klondike mafia family, though he appears to have a softer side when dealing with women and children, seeking the X-Playing cards for his own ends and has a shared history with Theodore and Norman.Bobby Ball, the one who started the battle of the X-Playing Cards against the unsuspecting Finn. The young and no-nonsense cruelty member of the Klondike family who works under the young executive Tilt servng as a mediating force for inter-family struggles, while managing the search for the X-Playing cards. This information is then disseminated to people like him to acquire them. He wields the 3 of Diamonds with the ""Marble Rumble"" power that lets him turn anything he grabs into marbles, which he can then use as projectile weapons.Honestly, the characters are what makes the series interesting, with their different Card abilities, as well as the usual poker sleight of hands that unleash powers beyond imaginability, such as the X-Hand of a deck of 4 cards in all suits to desire the user in granting any wish. And this is more so for Kawamoto, citing that “I want people to like the characters,"" when he asked what they were most looking forward for audiences to see. “We purposely made loveable characters. I hope that people will also love them like we do.” Muno also agrees in regard, citing that “In High Card, every single character has its meaning, has its job, has its reason to exist in that world. I would like people to find your favorite character. That’s something that we are looking forward to.” Something like Finn\'s rags-to-riches story of saving his Sun Fields Orphanage, that calculatingly and unconsciously involves the people whom he\'s close with, like director Lindsey Betz whom took him in when he lost his parents from a very young age from an unknown entity that killed his entire family, only to seek revenge by the way of using High Card as a platform to launch his investigation. Or in Chris\'s situation, to save a family member, as ought he was did when he was about to experience a near-death situation himself when he was young. The storyline and plot is clearly larger than life than what one would expect, and this being just the beginning to a much sinister story, I\'m hoping that whatever Season 2 has in store, it\'s going to be just as great as how this season laid the foundation for the story to grow and behold.This is the first time in a long while that Studio Hibari has made a presence in the anime production landscape, the last being Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun a.k.a Clean Freak Aoyama-kun back in 2017, and the years after being co-collaborations for some OVA/ONAs in between. That\'s because its subsidiaries are the 3DCG studio Larx Entertainment, and the well-known Lerche, which has taken over the studio\'s productions since 2011. Since then, the main parent studio has had quite the absence for more than a decade since its active years before the 2010s, so for High Card to be its resurgence anime in 6 years, it\'s great to see what the studio is capable of in pulling off a modern anime after being out for so long. The TL;DR is this: awesome action, great and strong visuals to add to the constant never-ending world-building lore, that it\'s actually so clean and refined. This will be amplified in Season 2, and I\'m looking forward to more consistency that\'s backed by the cool concept.The music is even better, I might as well say that it\'s the highlight of the anime itself. The man, the (not so) myth, the legend that is composer Ryo Takahashi himself, he has done some well-known works like Princess Principal and You-Zitsu a.k.a Classroom of the Elite to name a few. And to say that his music composition here is nothing short of magnificent, is truly an understatement, as next to one of my all-time favourite shows of last year (Healer Girl), High Card is action-packed, pumping beats that help the series truly elevate its high-stakes nature. Also, the OST here, it\'s my No. 1 top favorite of the season with FIVE NEW OLD\'s OP ""Trickster"" and utaite Meychan\'s ED ""Squad!"", both songs being absolute, ABSOLUTE hype bangers from Day One they hit the scene. A magnificent, outstanding debut for FIVE NEW OLD and Meychan\'s 2nd anime theme song (after Estab-Life: Great Escape) being an upbeat, squad-like catchy song that\'s easily worth the karaoke experience.All in all, if there was a negative to High Card, it would be how the story was weaved across these 12 episodes, with the uncertainty of an unsure stopping point. This is owed to subpar director Junichi Wada, which other than C2C\'s SukaSuka back in 2017 (which was a miracle in the area of flukes) hasn\'t had a hit series, and I\'m sincerely hoping that whenever Season 2 rolls around, will his directorialship prowess be finally known if he\'s still one capable director of trust.Still though, this is hopium more than copium for me, and until Season 2 comes again in the future, this is yet another sleeper hit that doesn\'t get enough attention. PLEASE, for the love of God, watch High Card. It\'s definitely a better Kakegurui if you still feel sucker-punched about said series.Are you ready? It\'s Showdown!! it\'s actually a mixed-media project from the minds of Homura Kawamoto, Hikaru Muno, and TMS Entertainment, with collaboration with anime producer Kadokawa and pachinko/pachislot developer Sammy Corporation. Though you will know that TMS Entertainment is the main studio of backing, one name in particular will stand out. And that person is mangaka Homura Kawamoto, the author of Kakegurui, which if you\'ve seen the MAPPA-produced shows of the TV series comprising 2 seasons back in Summer 2017 and Winter 2019, plus the Kakegurui Twin spin-off that was recently released on Netflix last August, you\'ll know that Homura Kawamoto is famous (or infamous, rather) for his over-the-top edgy, psychological thriller impulse that the gambling series is known for. And said gambling creator is back again in his new endeavour: the multimedia franchise that is High Card, with the project\'s focus showcasing the poker motif throughout the series, similar to the gambling theme in Kakegurui, with everything from the title to the names of fictional locations referencing some form of playing card game. And he\'s not alone, for Hikaru Muno, Kawamoto\'s brother and author of the Kakegurui LNs, has also joined him in the project, while TMS Entertainment will oversee the project with the illustrator Ebimo, who developed the character designs. And oh my gawd, it looks goddamn nice and striking.As compared to Kakegurui\'s school setting where the gambling takes place, High Card takes the typical Japanese school out of context, throws that onto the garbage bin, and injects a world that wherever people go, lives are at stake. That\'s because the series revolves around a special secret deck of 52 cards called “X-Playing Cards”, held by the mysterious Kingdom of Fourland\'s royal family. And as discoveries come and go, each card in the deck gives its owner (or “Player”) a very specific superhuman power or ability to whoever uses them. Some cards for example, gives its Player the ability to turn anything he touches into marbles, or extreme luck. And if this reminds you of the Kingsman franchise, then good, it’s supposed to. Kawamoto and Muno put their foot on the forefront that their series is heavily inspired by said movie franchise, with the idea being to create something that would appeal to global audiences. That’s also why they chose to set the series outside of Japan – a globe-trotting series, introducing characters from different cultures.The lead protagonist of High Card is Finn Oldman, a scrumpy young lad trying to raise funds for his orphanage before their heartless landlord clears them out of the building. Undetermined to have his spirit be broken for the orphaned children, he hitches a ride to the imitation of the Las Vegas casino to steal money from unsuspecting rich people so that he could pay up and make his Sun Fields Orphanage live to see another day. But rather than money, Finn suddenly gets involved in his own thievery that he didn\'t expect to be larger than life: a playing card that involves not the stake of money, but of lives. And with explosive suddenness, he gets embroiled in the battle over the X-Playing Cards, which the cards were before, stolen not too long ago and scattered across the land. Being armed with this, he becomes affiliated with High Card, the special private intelligence service group tasked by the King of Fourland to recover all 52 cards, while working undercover as salesmen for the luxurious Pinochle car company.The correlation of both High Card and Kingsman can be defined as such:Finn Oldman is the Gold Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin, a skilled pickpocket with great eyesight and focus allowing him to think multiple steps ahead, wielding the 2 of Spades with the ability of ""Neo New Nambu,"" which summons a loaded Nambu revolver into his hand, and can also summon extra bullets into his free hand.Chris Redgrave is the Red Harry ""Galahad"" Hart, a flirty womanizer and skilled driver with a sweet tooth, wielding the 5 of Hearts with the ability of ""Calorie\'s High"", allowing him to convert excess calories to heal injuries instantly that would otherwise prove fatal.Leo Constantine Pinochle is the Navy Blue Chester ""Arthur"" King, the 14-year-old son of Pinochle\'s CEO Theodore Constantine Pinochle, being the manager of the Old Maid branch office, with an abrasive demeanor that often grates on his colleagues. However, his position in society and his money puts him at the top of High Card, considering that his father is also the head of High Card, working directly under the King of Fourland. He wields the 7 of Diamonds with the ability of ""Never No Dollars"", that allows him to instantly swap any amount of money physically nearby for an object of equivalent value. He\'s constantly tapped together with his butler Bernard Symons: he is Merlin, the administrator for High Card, who does everything from serving tea to servicing cars at Pinochle\'s Old Maid branch.Wendy Sato is the Grey Roxanne ""Roxy"" Morton, the daughter of a master swordsman from the Far East, and the accountant for Pinochle\'s Old Maid branch office. She wields the Ace of Spades with the ability of ""Love and Peace,"" a large sword with a mind of its own that summons her sadistic side, and goes away once the power is under control.Vijay Kumar Singh is the Green James ""Lancelot"" Spencer, the highly intelligent PhD student at the University of Cribbage and the system manager-cum-cook at Pinochle\'s Old Maid office, with his aloof personality making him difficult to approach people. He wields the 3 of Clubs, with the power ""Green Green,"" allowing him to communicate with nearby plants and control them.Pinochle has no short of enemies, ranging from threats from rival car company ""Who\'s Who"" seeking to crush Pinochle, to the Klondike mafia family who wants the X-Playing cards for their own nefarious ends. And it\'s people like these that get in their way:Norman Kingstadt, the flamboyant and charismatic CEO of ""Who\'s Who"" in a one-sided rivalry with his childhood friend Theodore. He is aided by Blist Blitz Broadhurst, his personal secretary and bodyguard, who prefers to keep a strictly professional attitude while on the job, constantly reminding the charismatic CEO about pay and labour regulations even as he works to collect X-Playing cards for him. Blist is also a Player, wielding the 10 of Clubs with the ability of ""Million Volt,"" which lets him channel electricity through his body.Ban Klondike is the Dark antagonist Richmond Valentine, the head of the Klondike mafia family, though he appears to have a softer side when dealing with women and children, seeking the X-Playing cards for his own ends and has a shared history with Theodore and Norman.Bobby Ball, the one who started the battle of the X-Playing Cards against the unsuspecting Finn.

It\'s Showdown!!', 'When I looked at this initially, I thought it was a bit of Kingsmen meets Bungou Stray Dogs, and while that’s mostly right, the comparisons don’t do it any favors. It doesn’t have the kinetic action or suave sophistication of Kingsmen, it doesn’t really have the character bonds, development or direction of Bungou, it’s just… there.The show has a grand total of 5 major characters, spending the vast majority of its time developing two of them: Finn and Chris. That might be fine if Finn wasn’t a bog standard shonen MC that didn’t have anything interesting to him (the best comparison I have is to...Makoto Edamura, the MC from Great Pretender, who wasn’t great but was carried by a solid cast around him) and Chris wasn’t utterly predictable in virtually everything that counts as character development. There were some nice moments between them, but they were few and far between. The other 3 characters got, at max, a single episode worth of development (one of them didn’t even get that), and then largely vanished into the background until they were useful again.All of this would still be fine if the side characters or world were interesting, but more strikes against the show, they aren’t. Most of the side characters are either enigmatic, lacking any real development, or just function as stereotypes that either facilitate or hinder the heroes.As for the world, that’s what brought me to this series and I was hoping for so much more. The entire conceit of the show is that there are cards that grant magic powers that jive with individual users. That mostly stays consistent, and there is some backstory on how they work, albeit one that basically just chalks it up to magic. So far so fine. There’s a hierarchy for the cards that goes from 2 to Ace, and no, that does not stay consistent at all. The central mission of our heroes is to recover the cards for the king for obscure reasons, and there is one major group in conflict with them for even more obscure reasons. That’s fine, it’s not like Bungou spelled out everyone’s motivations in S1, but I just don’t know why I’m invested in these guys. They aren’t that interesting and their overall aims just feel too enigmatic and grand for me to care. There was an episode in the middle of this season where it felt like we were getting some more information, only for it just to be a “evil guy does evil things” moment with no spin out consequences.It really doesn’t help that the narrative seems to be running in place. There are few cards collected by the end, the villains don’t seem to care much, the big Chris moment was terribly undercut at the last moment, and it ends on a cliffhanger where Berserker from Fate Zero shows up (I’m only half joking).Long story short: don’t bother. The series visuals are fine, if a bit off-putting, and they’ve announced a S2, but I’m not planning on watching. It’s a series that played it safe on the narrative and still felt like it missed most of its swings. Consequences just don’t exist for our central cast, which just makes them sacred cows who will survive everything and come back just fine.

The first 4 eps are a good introduction to this story and it's characters.It's from Ep 5 the story really kicks in.

I feel...like Season 1 is just the beginning and am looking forward to the next season.Finn and Chris are a nice duo to follow. From Ep 7 we really get to see their friendship blossom and I can't wait to see more of them working together and depending on one another. Becoming 'buddies'Leo, Wendy and Vijay are also awesome! I wanna know more about them and see all 5 of them actually work as a team in the next season.The bad guys are menacing and the higher up our team reports to is equally strong and dangerous.The soundtrack is fun to listen to. Nothing special but good.I love the art and the colour scheme used. Reminded me of Balance Unlimited. The action sequences too.

I feel like this anime deserves more, the story is fairly unique, and so are the reasons for people having powers. The main character\'s backstory is heartwarming and main character worthy, not too crazy, but mysterious as well, hopefully we get into the mystery of his backstory in the second season which was already confirmed, good enough for us to root for him in his endeavours. The other characters are very likeable, but they did not get enough of a spotlight, would be nice...if we learned about them a bit more, have their own story and such. The powers in this anime are nicely portrayed, and unique, it\'s nice that the main character has the weakest power yet is able to use it in a useful way, but I hope there is something more to his power, maybe like how in the card game ""president"" 2 is the strongest card, and it secretly has a strong power like that.

It\'s a unique blend of superpowers and poker cards. Which is a refreshing change of pace from typical anime shows.The protagonist, Finn Oldman, may start as the weakest player with his 2 spades card. But that makes his journey all the more exciting. As the plot progresses, you\'ll find yourself invested in his story.While the world-building may be a bit heavy-handed in the first episode, the rest of the season focuses more on the characters and their relationships within the High Card group. And let me tell you, the characters are absolutely charming....While the plot may not be the most original, it\'s still a fun ride watching these people acting as a car dealers as their front.The animation is top-notch, and the voice acting is fantastic. Plus, the car designs are simply marvelous. And don\'t even get me started on the opening and ending themes. ""Trickster"" will have you hyped up for every episode, and ""スクワッド！"" is a total earworm that you\'ll find yourself singing along to.So if you\'re looking for an anime with vibrant animation, lovable characters, and catchy music, ""High Card"" is worth a watch.

The first ten minutes had me a little bored, but once they switch the story up to Finn's life where he steps into the casino, it starts getting a little interesting. You start by wondering if he's cheating his way to money, then the existence of the high cards gets revealed to you for the first time. That same episode is where all the killings for cards start happening, and oh boy, I was not expecting it. Every episode from then on had me clenching my toes in anticipation, ESPECIALLY towards the end...of the show.I'm a sucker for action, and if you are too, I cannot recommend this anime more. Chris Redgrave gave me emotional damage by the last episode. One of the most slept-on anime I have ever positively experienced. Finn might be on the weak side compared to every other character in the series, but the moments where he does shine with his 2 card are the times where they need a miracle the most. My favorite thing about this anime is how there are unique powers for each card, and each character (including side characters) has a decent amount of depth to them. The middle or near-end of the anime might be its weak point in terms of entertainment, though I had some good laughs.

I’m all for it personally the card system is a neat power system here look forward to see where the story goes. Finn is an ok protagonist I’m sure I’ll come to love him again seeing alot of kingsman similarities here with egsy with them both being From low income and them being dragged into this secret service but he feels different enough with him being a skilled pick pocket being able to properly plan out his approach shown in the first few moments in episode 1. I am a bit...disappointed they have just made him a good marksman and have let him into those secret services without any form of training or screening (they did some sort of background check but that’s it) they have just allowed a random civilian in because protagonists. Another thing is that nobody seem address the fact that he’s never handled a gun before but he can just do it perfectly without any problems and it’s just because 2 of spades card.

Another thing is that nobody seem address the fact that he’s never handled a gun before but he can just do it perfectly without any problems and it’s just because 2 of spades card. Like it would have been nice to have a small scene of him struggling to reload or just a slight bit of panic when his revolver runs out and him working out how to actually reload a gun.

It gives ""kingsman"" movie vibes! If you dont have super high expectations of an anime or just want to watch something cause youre bored, then watch it. So far imo, it gets max 6/10!Opening and ending songs and animation are good. The overall animation is good but not perfect. The story is good but has its own flaws. (maybe its too soon to judge the whole show)I dont want to be super negative about it and say that i dont recommend it. People have different tastes, someone might enjoy it more than me.  And...tbh even though its not THAT good, its still kinda interesting to watch! 🤣 i dont know how to express my feeling about it tbh, hence ""mixed feelings""( i would definitely change my rating and review if the story get better)And like some other comments said, episode 3 and how they handled the antagonists was highly questionable ! (I wouldnt even call them antagonists tbh)Edit after finishing the anime: 7/10 max, imo! I still have mixed feelings! The story is fine (kinda cliché, but fine and interesting enough to watch).

Atleast try to make it more interesting , it has some good moment or emotional ones but that was for short...time besides that sometimes I feel they just missed the point of anime and they ended talking about other thing that has no connection with the story , and the ending was really avreage with a short cutscene at the end to add more thriller but I guess it is what it is , let's wait for the second season and hope they gonna fill the story with some interesting stuff . time besides that sometimes I feel they just missed the point of anime and they ended talking about other thing that has no connection with the story , and the ending was really avreage with a short cutscene at the end to add more thriller but I guess it is what it is , let's wait for the second season and hope they gonna fill the story with some interesting stuff ."", 'I started watching this show with the expectation that it would be a dumb, good time, and even with those lowered expectations I still managed to be let down. Still, I did find some enjoyment here and there so it wasn\'t all bad.The main thing that drew me to watch this was the main gimmick of the show: a deck of 52 playing cards, each one granting its user some kind of superpower. They play into this goofy premise a little bit, but honestly I really wanted them to lean much harder into the silliness. There\'s some visual symbolism involving the cards, one of...the main areas is called ""Fourland"" (four card suits), and so on. I wanted them to go all-out with this gimmick, think Alice in Wonderland, or Deltarune. Something like that would have been fun.A big issue with this show, in my opinion, lies with the protagonist. First of all, ""Finn Oldman"" is a terrible name, full stop. Second, he really doesn\'t bring much to the show in terms of personality or agency. He has a decent amount of character growth, sure, but there is very little reason to care about him as a person.Around episode 8 we start getting more info about his tragic backstory. He was raised at an orphanage, ""Sunny Fields"", and his dream is to support it financially or something, I forget. This is a pretty lazy attempt to pull at the heartstrings, but what\'s even worse is that we barely get any insight into what this place really means to him, aside from some lines of dialogue from him. We never see him growing up, really interacting with people there, the first time we get a look at the place it gets burned down by a super villain 3 minutes later. You\'ve given me, and the rest of the audience, no time at all to absorb this information and as a result I now don\'t care what happens to Finn anymore.Finn\'s power is that...he gets a gun. That\'s it. Finn\'s card power is basically just Hol Horse from Jojo, which was widely considered to be one of the worst Stand abilities of that show. It\'s even acknowledged in the show that Finn\'s power sucks. However, Finn has great aim with said gun, and it\'s never explained if this is part of the power or if he just has plot-armor that allows him to always land his shots.I\'m actually okay with shows featuring a ""weak"" protagonist, I think you can tell some really interesting stories around people like this, but Finn just doesn\'t do much to affect the story going forward. It feels like everything happening around him doesn\'t really depend on him being or not being there, besides maybe the last episode.Another thing that really bothered me was the season\'s main conflict involving Chris, one of Finn\'s friends (or colleges, as Chris would say). Spoilers ahead obviously. Chris obtains 4 cards and is planning on using them to save his sick sister\'s life in exchange for his own. Finn decides that this is unacceptable and does everything in his power to stop him. The show features characters agreeing with Finn\'s motives, even if it\'s not in the interest of the company he\'s working for.This is just so stupid I can\'t begin to get into it. Frankly, I\'m not rooting for Finn at this point. Chris loves his sister and would do anything to save her life, and he wants to make a noble sacrifice for her, the same way his father did for him. I actually view this as a heroic and selfless thing to do, and at this point I would encourage Chris to follow his heart.Finn\'s goal to stop Chris comes from a place of selfishness, and this is never addressed by the show. The show expects us to be on Finn\'s side, but we just don\'t have a strong reason to be. Finn doesn\'t want to lose one of his only friends. I get that and all, but like I said earlier, I find it really hard to get invested when I don\'t really care about Finn all that much. And of course, Finn ends up getting rewarded by making the ""right"" choice in an ending twist that\'s so dumb I can\'t wait to forget about it.All negativity aside, the show does have some fun moments. Some of the abilities are fun and clever, and there are decent episodes in here, such as the heist mission where they have to steal a card from a boat\'s auction. The animation is average, maybe slightly above average with some janky moments at times. The opening is fine and the ending song is actually a surprise banger. the main areas is called ""Fourland"" (four card suits), and so on.

It wasted too much time on fillers and not enough to focus on the plot itself, which makes it drag on into Season 2 (that they planned) but at this speed it will take them a lot of time to pull out anything meaningful in terms of plot progress.I felt exhausted finishing these 12 episodes to be honest.

I dont know if the pacing is the same as in the manga as i do not read it, however it felt extremely fast paced and dozens of unexplained events happening one after another. The plot left me heavily confused about what is truly happening in this world of High Card, i was so confused that i barely had any desire to finish it, powers are left unexplained, cards are left unexplained, literally nothing is explained in this anime and it feels like everything that happens in the world of high card is...highly fantastic.First what left me so confused is the plot, even after completing the anime i am still a little bit confused about the entire plot, sure it must have some mystery but its rather a mess than a mystery, second - these cards are explained to give a certain superpower once they are played but through the entire season i can see how our main character who has the weakest card and is the weakest is jumping left and right, surviving all bullets, firestorms, hazards, jumping off train bridge and etc, is he having a plot armor or is just that all cards give some sort of super flying powers and unpenetretable armor because all of them keep surviving and keep acting like their cards give them superman powers along with the certain power that is explained, seriously this anime lacks logic for me and is highly fanstatic, nothing is properly explained, nothing. I literally felt like wasting my time watching this anime because the plot is extremely confusing and unexplained, this anime should have been an 24 episode cour or its just that the anime is not well made - i dont know as i dont read the manga.The only good thing about this anime is that its art, music and has decent amount of action, honestly for me going into this anime i was excited as i really liked the idea, definitely High Card is an anime with High Potential but a wasted one for sure. I've always liked such animes with cards, carnivals, circus and musical instrument vibes but this one dissapointed me heavily.

Once you gather all 7 Dragon Balls, you will have  your wish--whoops, wrong show. Seriously, though, the story is just too generic for me to care about it.There was a lot going for it. The animation and art style is quite nice. Some fights are just done off screen, but the fighting scenes that the show decides to animate aren\'t bad at all. The colors, cuts, and choreography are all definitely above average. This show was not lacking in budget. The protagonist is charming. He\'s got a super...boring backstory about being poor and resorting to crime to make ends meet, but his personality really shines through his actions in the first episode. He\'s a decent guy, but willing to take risks when opportunity strikes. The pilot episode, other than the beginning--which was just useless flavor text--really caught my attention and introduces the world and main character in a bombastic sequence of events. Then there\'s the 52 cards. Each card contains different strengths, weaknesses, and a unique ability. The show really could have been cooking up anything. A battle royale consisting of all 52 card holders or really just different card holding organizations vying for cards in an everlasting power struggle of turf wars. I had high hopes.Instead, you got ""good guy organization"" vs ""bad guy organization."" What\'s even the point of watching something like this? I don\'t care what the demographic is meant for or the fact that it\'s graphic sometimes, it\'s a fucking shounen show. The protagonist just gets thrown into a random ""good guy organization"" and the rest of the plot is just ""good guys"" vs blatantly bad guys that kill people. So original. Even the likes of characters like Chris aren\'t that bad, but they just get completely ruined by the story direction. Like haha, Finn is a good guy. Don\'t believe me? Watch him save a stranger to prove his good-heartedness. Aren\'t you glad he\'s a good guy that has superpowers than the bad gang guy that has superpowers that kills people for fun and ruin peoples\' lives? Then there\'s Leo Constantine. Isn\'t it super cool that he\'s got daddy issues and how he doesn\'t care that his father ruins other people\'s lives by gouging small business with a complete monopoly in his industry while probably openly ""lobbying"" government officials? I completely made up the last part of course, but it\'s true that episode 3 talks about his father gouging small businesses, and how Leo states that ""only the strong survive."" Using a hyperbole as an example, doesn\'t that mean he tacitly agrees that strong people should be able to kill weak people, like the bad gang people? Isn\'t it funny that the small business owners that got bankrupt eventually are colored as super bad, maniacal guys that murder and kidnap and then the good guys are part of the rich organization? Wow, such a coincidence. I looked up Pinochle to see if it was an actual company and it was sponsoring this show, but no, it\'s fictional. Considering how Finn comes from a poor background, I was expecting him to be a lot more empathetic and question his loyalties or something, but nah, he\'s just happy to serve.Anyways, regardless of my rant, this show really is just a generic shounen trope-filled show of a mess.

There\'s 52 special cards that give unique abilities to ""players"". These players have powers that can be used for good, or for bad. Anyways, the king wants to collect the cards for obvious reasons, and that\'s what the main force, High Card, is trying to accomplish.I really like a lot of things about High Card. I think the character design is interesting, to say the least. All of the characters seems to have drip as...well. The concept itself, a world where gambling is the true power, is pretty unique and cool. I also think a lot of the powers are out there enough for them to be praised.The power scaling is also apparent enough for you to realize who is stronger than who with each number relatively reflecting how strong someone is. Someone with a 2 (like the main character) doesn\'t get anything too powerful, but someone with an ace gets something crazy. (but there\'s a drawback, cause yk, it\'s an ace. They have double purposes as a 1 and a 10)Where High Card falls apart for me is the writing. While the first few episodes were good, the more the anime dragged on, the worse it became. There are a plentiful amount of plot holes and issue with this anime where it simply becomes laughable for me. (and the friend I watched this with, hence why we put it off for so long.) Admittedly, they were sort of negligible at first, with it being something to just point and laugh at. However, there\'s one specific instance that is something that isn\'t ignorable, and that is how terrible the season\'s ending is.Without going into too much detail, the ending stinks, and does not set up High Card at all for a second season. (Yet, for some reason, got one unexpectedly fast. I don\'t know how. It was somehow announced in the last episode and already came out and has finished of this review.) The ending has a very common trope of everyone just forgetting what happened and everything going back to normal. It makes absolutely no sense, especially considering one of the twists at the end. This is something that has absolutely affected my score of High Card negatively.Anyways, with that out of the way, it\'s time to wrap this review up.Would I recommend High Card?I mean, if you have nothing better to watch. It had a lot of potential at the start and was something magical. It fell off hard though. If you can push past the subpar writing, sure; give it a watch I guess! If you can\'t though, don\'t watch it.Would I tune in for a season 2?I mean, it depends on what my friend thinks. I don\'t think I\'ll be watching the season two in my spare time, but if him and I get together again to watch it, sure.Overall score:6.4/10 well.

Finn Oldman a teenager gets hired...at for this group and this show is of him overcoming his adventures.Unique ideas (SPOLIER ALERT): a car dealership front for a secret squad for the king, some really creative power ideas and/or names (like ""High Calorie"" being regeneration (unique name) and a cloning ability that hurts when splitting (John Does power). I liked these a lot.Bad traits: So,e powers were very common in the anime multiverse. Like Coming Home was a gravitational pull towards self (like Naruto\'s Pain Royal Push), the son of the car dealership head had the power to turn money into items/power equal or lesser value (similar to Bungou Stray Dogs American Guild head power) and some that were really pretty useless (like Love Connection holding onto someone physically until the card user seperates them and Finn Oldman\'s ability to create a gun in thin air, shoot in a staright line and make infinit ebullets) These as a good amount of the powers really dulled the show and not every card got an explanation for the powers they had.

I give it an 8 out of 10. The fights were crazy based on the limits of a power but fights seemed to end a lot sooner than i wanted.

Also Finn has a bloody past and that was only briefly gone over? Season 2 is coming out and confirmed and i hope a lot of questions in the first season will be cleared up. Does the Redgraves history with High card mean that Chris has contributed much since he was 12 to the organization? did he start at 12 working for them or was he an adult? what character development will Chris Redgrave have besides being a secret edgelord? Will we see Finn Oldman\'s past recreated and light shed on that black knight? It was quite a cliffhanger for the Klondike Family.Animation and music - i couldn\'t skip the opening and endings. they were very nice to watch and hear and i enjoyed them. the animation style was not bad at all to see. I didn\'t notice a lot of animation mistakes like background characters being less detailed to the point of negligence and the colors were really nice.I am definitely watching season 2 because i want to know more about the characters than what was given. at for this group and this show is of him overcoming his adventures.Unique ideas (SPOLIER ALERT): a car dealership front for a secret squad for the king, some really creative power ideas and/or names (like ""High Calorie"" being regeneration (unique name) and a cloning ability that hurts when splitting (John Does power).

The first season focuses a lot on the characters introducing instead of the MC progressing. The cards power system is very good, the world building too, but the story and the pacing is kinda meh. The MC also lacks charisma and power to keep us viewer hooked to him in the first season. He's basically how not to make a main character in a 12 episodes anime. Make him generic looking and give him the weakest most useless power possible. His only power is...his high accuracy in shooting and pickpocketing. His 2 spade card is basically useless as he can just use any pistol or even a better gun. I have finished all 12 episodes and he's still as bland as ever. No power up and is still useless in combat. So, how did he survives all the 12 episodes? Plot armor of course, as per usual in animes. Make an OP high card opponent miss their skills or make some random other characters indirectly help him so he can run. Yes run, not beat the opponent.

Kanashimi no Belladonna,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3220/Kanashimi_no_Belladonna,"[""A corrupted woman is soaked in sin and gradually torn from her soul. Her purity that was once unscathed is now an unbounded commodity. Piece by piece, she is dismantled until the only thing that’s left is flesh and blood. From the ashes of unadulterated youth, now rises something else. The transformation from beauty to grotesque is immediate. A woman is either a maiden or a witch. A sin or a sinner. An unknowing victim or an unholy perpetrator. The existence of both is morally reprehensible. Here we have the scripture of ye old storytelling embedded in every culture, every time, and in every form.Nonetheless...every artifice, every duality inherits a line that exists to challenge it. A tempo-spatial blip where white melds into the black – where Angels mingle with Demons, where grotesqueness is beauty, where tragedy births empowerment, where witches ARE women – explodes with a forgotten force. That coalescing blip takes form in Belladonna of Sadness (Kanashimi no Belladonna): a powerful visual enigma that mesmerizes with bizarre aestheticism and erotic storytelling (one that many will probably write off as a “deep” hentai and in the process, dismiss the work so passionately fueled by the revolutionary spirit that drives all provocative art).Belladonna is the third and final installment in the Animerama series (adult-themed films) conceptualized by Osamu Tezuka, but due to his early abandonment of the project, it was sought through (in 1973) by Eiichi Yamamoto and produced by Mushi Production. Adapted loosely from the non-fictional musings in La Sorcière by Jules Michelet, Belladonna follows the vicious downfall of a young girl named Jeanne, and thus, her metamorphosis. Even though Belladonna takes influence from Michelet’s book, it is not a literal re-telling. The novelty of Michelet’s work, however, should be noted. La Sorciere attempted to trace the rebellions against feudalism and Medieval practices that subjugated women and peasants. Riddled with folklore, fairy tales, and religious theory, the book opened a new sympathetic vision towards the oppressed, and what eventually manifested into “witchcraft”. Belladonna is a tale about oppression, but also about revolution. What starts off as a fatalistic chain of events steeped in sexual violence and tradition, morphs into a darkly, disturbing tale of empowerment (featuring Satan symbolized as an ever-growing penis, lots and lots of other phallic imagery, and intense psychedelics visuals).The aesthetical direction in Belladonna is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Sequences of stylistically-independent paintings that are tied by motion. Styles include Klimt-influenced artworks where the female body is the everlasting focus. The only place where precision in detail matters is on Jeanne, and partly her husband and abusers. Following in the symbolist tradition, many embodied the elements of Decadence. These paintings were full of lurid, exploitative objects that were flourishing with mystical context. Decadent art called for transgression and taboo and expressed them through dreamlike visual poetics. Belladonna adapts this with acuity. Abstract, expressionistic paintings also take hold here. The use of placement, distance, object and how they come alive, both with color and shape all reveal this. There are scenes that are built entirely on geometric progression. The painting starts at one point, transforming into a set of shapes that blooms into the eventual scenery. Kaleidoscopic backgrounds and mural-stoned-faces swell up the screen, while continuous mutations and distortions keep the atmosphere full of psychedelic vigor. It’s like a never-ending party in the 60s. The art-style is intensely experimental and frequently disorienting. The styles and influences here are endless: watercolor paintings, ink-stencil portraits, sketchbook graphics, bubbly cartoons, and the list goes on – of all the various art-styles contained in this film. Even though the film ranges in the kind of techniques it employs – many of them being direct contrasts to one another – it never hiccups, not even once. The continual change in style becomes equally as important for the story. It’s a story with centuries of sociopolitical turmoil, unveiled through centuries of art evolution on canvas. And the best part is that it’s always fluid and always flowing.Consequently, Belladonna's art is demanding, bold, highly erotic, often-etched-imminently, and absolutely unforgiving. The shots move ever-so emphatically; scenes feel as if being drawn out right then and there. The horror here transposes itself not just as a genre, but a state, an endless feeling that seduces the senses while suffocating the mind. There are scenes comprised of simple shapes, lines intersecting, and splashes of unending red and black that are more horrific than most horror films attempting to be anything more than a gore-fest nowadays. The film functions in directional panning waves that slide from painting to painting, with minimal movement and sparse dialogue. One of the most laudable aspects was the use of motion. Films, at a very fundamental level, need to master the skill of motion; to be able to capture the mobility of ideas in a visual format. In the same way that sometimes silence speaks louder than sound, stasis expresses visual ideas more potently than systematic movement. It’s animation revised: unbridled by traditional sequential movement, materialized through motion on canvas. Stasis then becomes as important as motion. Belladonna proves this with its delicate and deliberate staging and execution.Now really, what is Belladonna about? The aesthetics tell it all. The “how” is infinitely more valuable than the “what”. Even then, there is still plenty to bask in, narratively. Belladonna is a purely visual experience, but isolating the narrative is worthwhile. Reconnecting with the earlier synopsis, Belladonna tells the seemingly unfortunate tale of Jeanne. On her wedding night, as custom dictates, Jeanne and her husband Jean must receive the okay from the baron (through paying ridiculous monetary “gifts”). As they cannot meet the high demands set by the Baron, Jeanne is subjected to ritualistic rape by the Baron and his house of ghastly courtiers. From then onward, Jeanne continues to suffer at the hands of her time, repeatedly violated by those in power and by circumstance, she finds herself in an old-fashioned predicament: compromising her humanity.  It’s not original in its premise. Tales of religious persecution, power, and transformation almost always follow a similar formula: striking a deal with the devil. Therefore, the story unfolds on a two-fold: first, on the degradation of humanity and second, on the revival of it.What sets Belladonna apart is its perspective and thematic subversion. The apparent importance of religion, tradition, and all these concepts that arise from scripture of society all take a backseat for Jeanne’s place in the world. She becomes the singular point of relevance amongst cosmic indifference, where she comes before the judgments of the world. This is crucial for the second half of the story and the ultimate, conclusion. The perspective here is refreshing, in the ways many modern fairy tales are, especially those with a female focus. The one that immediately comes to mind is a collection of short stories by Angela Carter titled The Bloody Chamber. These tales are of the revolutionaries — the nontraditional, and those unaligned with the religious depiction of “woman”–, where through the crevices of preordained evil and sacrilegious, arises positivity in the form of empowerment and transformation. These are far more important than redemption or “survival”. It’s history, art, and humanity revisited but with the scales tipping the other way. Thus, the devil becomes a tool. Evil becomes a means to an end. The deal becomes a means to an end. The body is shown to be purely material and the spirit/soul as mere propaganda. Things that held the greatest amounts of meaning become empty remnants in the face of ultimate transformation. The most important point is that woman and witch remain synonymous. This isn’t a movement to destroy humanity, but to revolutionize it.Jeanne makes the deal and becomes a witch. Yet, she doesn’t seek revenge in the old-testament sort of horrific way. She sets the way for the townspeople and all those that violated her to find hell in their own manner, whether it’s through hedonism, paganism, or partaking in 24/7 orgies. The Black Plague is also a thing, here (and the origins are hilarious but terrifying). Jeanne helps those struck by the plague (using various plants and concoctions) and becomes their savior. With her “help”, the villagers willingly walk on their personalized road to perdition. (Belladonna is a nightshade plant. The root was used to make medicine, but the leaves and berries are deadly. It’s named after Venetian ladies who used it to dilate pupils for striking appearances). Jeanne assumes her rightly place as the Belladonna who in the wrong doses, proves to be lethal and insurmountable. As Angela Carter reformulates the heroine/woman in modern fairy tales, “Like the wild beasts, she lives without a future. She inhabits only the present tense, a fugue of the continuous, a world of sensual immediacy as without hope as it is without despair,” we find ourselves seeing Jeanne reflected in the very same words. Jeanne descends into –what we perceive as– madness, a form of clinical hysteria from any angle. Despite that, there is something far deeper settling in her reverie: “The girl burst out laughing; she knew she was nobody’s meat.” And that very Carter-ian depiction becomes the absolute state of Jeanne.Even with the inevitable “end” of Jeanne, the story holds true to what actualized empowerment entails: continuation. It doesn’t end with the body.Experiencing Belladonna is very much like falling down a bottomless rabbit hole. A visceral drop where one experiences each grain of the twisted earth, swallowing wholly, their entire state of being. The dive isn’t measured. It’s freefall so fast, one almost feels like they are suspended in air, motionless. During those moments, every sensory receptor is attuned to an unknown, unearthly frequency. It’s a film designed to enthrall the senses and heighten all temporality. The kind of thing people do drugs for. Spectacularly, it achieves this for every second of its runtime. Enter this with an open mind. Belladonna knows for she is woman and witch, and both exist here simultaneously. every artifice, every duality inherits a line that exists to challenge it.

And the best part is that it’s always fluid and always flowing.Consequently, Belladonna's art is demanding, bold, highly erotic, often-etched-imminently, and absolutely unforgiving. The shots move ever-so emphatically; scenes feel as if being drawn out right then and there. The horror here transposes itself not just as a genre, but a state, an endless feeling that seduces the senses while suffocating the mind. There are scenes comprised of simple shapes, lines intersecting, and splashes of unending red and black that are more horrific than most horror films attempting to be anything more than a gore-fest nowadays. The film functions in directional panning waves that slide from painting to painting, with minimal movement and sparse dialogue. One of the most laudable aspects was the use of motion. Films, at a very fundamental level, need to master the skill of motion; to be able to capture the mobility of ideas in a visual format. In the same way that sometimes silence speaks louder than sound, stasis expresses visual ideas more potently than systematic movement. It’s animation revised: unbridled by traditional sequential movement, materialized through motion on canvas. Stasis then becomes as important as motion. Belladonna proves this with its delicate and deliberate staging and execution.Now really, what is Belladonna about? The aesthetics tell it all. The “how” is infinitely more valuable than the “what”. Even then, there is still plenty to bask in, narratively. Belladonna is a purely visual experience, but isolating the narrative is worthwhile. Reconnecting with the earlier synopsis, Belladonna tells the seemingly unfortunate tale of Jeanne. On her wedding night, as custom dictates, Jeanne and her husband Jean must receive the okay from the baron (through paying ridiculous monetary “gifts”). As they cannot meet the high demands set by the Baron, Jeanne is subjected to ritualistic rape by the Baron and his house of ghastly courtiers. From then onward, Jeanne continues to suffer at the hands of her time, repeatedly violated by those in power and by circumstance, she finds herself in an old-fashioned predicament: compromising her humanity.  It’s not original in its premise. Tales of religious persecution, power, and transformation almost always follow a similar formula: striking a deal with the devil. Therefore, the story unfolds on a two-fold: first, on the degradation of humanity and second, on the revival of it.What sets Belladonna apart is its perspective and thematic subversion. The apparent importance of religion, tradition, and all these concepts that arise from scripture of society all take a backseat for Jeanne’s place in the world. She becomes the singular point of relevance amongst cosmic indifference, where she comes before the judgments of the world. This is crucial for the second half of the story and the ultimate, conclusion. The perspective here is refreshing, in the ways many modern fairy tales are, especially those with a female focus. The one that immediately comes to mind is a collection of short stories by Angela Carter titled The Bloody Chamber. These tales are of the revolutionaries — the nontraditional, and those unaligned with the religious depiction of “woman”–, where through the crevices of preordained evil and sacrilegious, arises positivity in the form of empowerment and transformation. These are far more important than redemption or “survival”. It’s history, art, and humanity revisited but with the scales tipping the other way. Thus, the devil becomes a tool. Evil becomes a means to an end. The deal becomes a means to an end. The body is shown to be purely material and the spirit/soul as mere propaganda. Things that held the greatest amounts of meaning become empty remnants in the face of ultimate transformation. The most important point is that woman and witch remain synonymous. This isn’t a movement to destroy humanity, but to revolutionize it.Jeanne makes the deal and becomes a witch. Yet, she doesn’t seek revenge in the old-testament sort of horrific way. She sets the way for the townspeople and all those that violated her to find hell in their own manner, whether it’s through hedonism, paganism, or partaking in 24/7 orgies. The Black Plague is also a thing, here (and the origins are hilarious but terrifying). Jeanne helps those struck by the plague (using various plants and concoctions) and becomes their savior. With her “help”, the villagers willingly walk on their personalized road to perdition. (Belladonna is a nightshade plant. The root was used to make medicine, but the leaves and berries are deadly. It’s named after Venetian ladies who used it to dilate pupils for striking appearances). Jeanne assumes her rightly place as the Belladonna who in the wrong doses, proves to be lethal and insurmountable. As Angela Carter reformulates the heroine/woman in modern fairy tales, “Like the wild beasts, she lives without a future. She inhabits only the present tense, a fugue of the continuous, a world of sensual immediacy as without hope as it is without despair,” we find ourselves seeing Jeanne reflected in the very same words. Jeanne descends into –what we perceive as– madness, a form of clinical hysteria from any angle. Despite that, there is something far deeper settling in her reverie: “The girl burst out laughing; she knew she was nobody’s meat.” And that very Carter-ian depiction becomes the absolute state of Jeanne.Even with the inevitable “end” of Jeanne, the story holds true to what actualized empowerment entails: continuation. It doesn’t end with the body.Experiencing Belladonna is very much like falling down a bottomless rabbit hole. A visceral drop where one experiences each grain of the twisted earth, swallowing wholly, their entire state of being. The dive isn’t measured. It’s freefall so fast, one almost feels like they are suspended in air, motionless. During those moments, every sensory receptor is attuned to an unknown, unearthly frequency. It’s a film designed to enthrall the senses and heighten all temporality. The kind of thing people do drugs for. Spectacularly, it achieves this for every second of its runtime. Enter this with an open mind. Belladonna knows for she is woman and witch, and both exist here simultaneously."", 'Overview:My city\'s only arthouse theater decided to play this 1973 anime movie recently. I went with a couple buddies and it was...an experience. I will now try explain my mixed feelings on this rather unique film.Background:This movie is sometimes called ""the lost Tezuka masterpiece"" although Osamu Tezuka actually left the project quite early in production. Kanashimi no Belladonna or  ""Belladonna of Sadness"" was written and directed by Tezuka\'s longtime friend and collaborator Eiichi Yamamoto. Yamamoto worked with Tezuka on Astro Boy and Kimba the White Lion, as well as writing Space Battleship Yamato, the first Space Opera anime.Belladonna of Sadness is an X-rated...avant garde telling of a Faustian melodrama set in medieval France. The anime is loosely based on a 19th century non-fiction book called  ""Satanism and Witchcraft"" that posits that ritual witchcraft and Wicca were created to rebel against the patriarchal rule of the Church and Monarchy. The book also prominently featured erotic art by a French artist who went by the pseudonym Martin van Maële. The anime follows the book\'s example by having a LOT of trippy, psychedelic eroticism that frankly detracts more often than it adds to the film.Plot:A poor farming couple named Jean and Jeanne are married in medieval France. However, they can\'t afford to pay the outrageously high ""wedding tax"" of their feudal lord, so the lord demands the right to gangbang Jeanne with his friends on her wedding night. As an aside, this practice was called ""Droit du seigneur"" and was alleged to have happened in real medieval France, although no hard evidence can be found and many historians believe it was a myth created hundreds of years later. Jeanne is emotionally devastated and her distress summons the Devil, who offers her power and revenge in exchange for her soul. Jeanne agrees at first to give the Devil her body, but not her soul. Satan accepts the offer after some truly bizarre sex and Jeanne gains the ability to spin beautiful fabric.Jeanne is able to make enough money with her fabric to pay their lord\'s outrageous tax, so he makes her husband his official tax collector. However, this increase in wealth and power does nothing to improve their happiness. Jean isn\'t able to collect enough taxes from the peasants, so the lord cuts off his hand. Jean then becomes a miserable drunk. Jeanne is able to use her new gained powers to bewitch a greedy moneylender into giving her a large sum. She is able to give the evil lord the money he demands, but the evil lord\'s wife is jealous of Jeanne and plots revenge. The countess\'s Page slashes Jeanne\'s dress and the townsfolk all immediately decide to try rape her. Jean locks her out of the house and watches while the whole town rapes his wife! After Jean collected his award for ""Cuck of the Year"", Jeanne gets thrown in the dungeon to rot. She escapes the dungeon with the help of Satan and after reaching her breaking point, she finally agrees to give him her soul in exchange for revenge.A plague ravages the town and many are killed. Jeanne returns to the town looking beautiful and offers a magical cure for the disease. She convinces the townspeople to rebel against the evil feudal lord and God. Jeanne even gets revenge on the Countess by charming her page into sleeping with the Countess and getting them both murdered by the lord. The lord offers to give her land and power, but she rejects these offers and says she wants ""everything"". The lord then has her burned at the stake in a scene reminiscent of French heroine Joan d\'Arc. The worthless husband Jean finally rises against the lord, but is killed by his soldiers. The rest of the townsfolk cower in fear and Jeanne\'s rebellion is crushed at least for now. The story ends with French women leading the March on Versailles and stating that in France it is the women that lead revolutions. The End.Art:You will immediately notice that the art is NOTHING like most anime. The art in this 1973 anime actually seems to be inspired by 1960s European cartoons like Yellow Submarine from the UK and Bremen Town Musicians from the USSR. Eiichi Yamamoto is the one guy that left the theater after watching those movies and said, ""This would be WAY better if everyone started fucking!"" The animation is quite good for its time though and the surreal art can be quite impressive at points.Music:The music is often chaotic Bebop jazz. This unfortunately reminds me of Kite, the only other anime with wild saxophone solos while people bang. Occasionally though an ocarina will play accompanied by guitar and reminds me a LOT of the theme ""Lonely Shepard"" from Kill Bill. I spent at least 1/4th of this movie expecting a Tarantino bloodbath to occur at any minute.Overall:While this movie certainly had strengths like  strong animation, a solid soundtrack, and a unique premise...it falls a bit short of being a masterpiece in my opinion. The trippy sex scenes generally seemed like a desperate grab for attention instead of adding to the themes of the story. If this was a minor detail I would let it slide, but they take up around half the entire movie! If you want an elitist arthouse anime with tons of porno that will kick Europeans right in the childhood...this is your anime. avant garde telling of a Faustian melodrama set in medieval France.

The nature of sin and excess; the act of wanting too much without understanding the cost. A cautionary tale of indulgence as showcased by an unnamed kingdom positioned in the Middle Ages. The unfortunate recipients of which are Jean and Jeanne, a couple young in love in a world far too cutthroat to accept the purity of their union. Their honeymoon, a nightmarish event, forever tainted by the cruel actions of an aristocrat drunk with power. Deflowered and battered, Jeanne, a victim of the...worst kind of atrocity, is left a wilted rose in her husband\'s arms. A newlywed couple demoralized by the ones appointed by God to reign over them. Betrayed by those in power and emotionally abandoned by her husband, Jeanne is left to pick up the pieces. With nothing but time to keep her company—misplaced guilt far too stifling to forget, and an act of selfishness far too wicked to forgive—she searches for solace away from society\'s pitiful gaze. For a way to regain some semblance of self after being deprived of her womanhood.And in this moment of weakness, desperate and defeated, whispers of vengeance caress her ear, the temptation of which becomes far too alluring to ignore. These sweet whispers are made by a demon, one conjured up by the smoldering embers of spite ignited in place of the self-pity that occupied her idle mind. A chance to strike back at the ones that robbed her is offered. A doleful plea made in the stillness of night, she succumbs to the opportunity, accepting the help of the phallic spirit that appears before her. A decision this trickster demon revels in, as he obtains another fresh prey to sink his fangs into. Her future regret providing a source of nourishment for his mischief, as the slow grooming process begins. A pact was now made with the Devil, signed with the ink of atrocities yet to come and regrets yet to manifest.This is the world stage that Belladonna of Sadness creates, the means in which it\'s brought to life sharing equal importance. Watercolor brushstrokes wisp across the curvature of Jeanne\'s delicate frame, her fair skin left bare, absent of pigmentation. Color pencil outlines contort around landscapes, containing greenery, houses, citizens and wildlife alike; everything encased in its perimeters. Even abstract expressions aren\'t forgotten; moments of doubt, corruption, depravity, and envy illustrated by ink bleeding in all directions across the canvas. Brittle charcoal lines trailing right behind it to further emphasize the spread of these ideas and emotions.Oil pastels, watercolor paint, charcoal, color pencils, graphite pencils, stencil outlines; all these utensils used for expression cascades towards a singular vision, harmoniously melding together to bring the story to life. Influenced by the art styles of Harry Clarke, Gustav Klimt, and many others, Belladonna is given a gothic-like expressionistic visual portrayal. Lengthy body postures with spindly limbs. Decorated clothing that hugs their bodies like a second skin. Every bit of it giving birth to a timeless look. Something like a rediscovered tapestry that was lost to the Dark Ages.Even the namesake of Belladonna helps define the film. Belladonna, a toxic berry also referred to as deadly nightshade, or ""bella donna"" as derived from the Italian phrase meaning ""beautiful woman""—essentially, a deadly beauty—was a plant used throughout history as either a cosmetic accessory or an instrument of death. The film doesn\'t shy away from this as well, as the Black Plague parallels are just as self-evident here as it is in films like 1957\'s The Seventh Seal. The biggest difference between the two being the person that serves as arbiter of judgment. Instead of Death himself casting a shadow on all those he encounters, the role is personally taken on by the Devil. He brandishes death in one hand while dangling false hope in the other. That false hope coming in the form of his future mistress-to-be, Jeanne; something we\'re made privy to as the story slowly unfolds. It\'s a fate unwillingly bestowed onto her but one she will come to embrace, for better or for worse. It\'s the birth of a deadly beauty, of belladonna itself.Tasting the forbidden fruit, what started out as an earnest plea for help quickly spirals into madness, as the payment levied for her request is paid by body and soul. Jeanne gets her vengeance but at a cost that far exceeds what she had expected. Everything is brought to ruin. Her head rests in the crook of her arm, smeared tears coagulate, glistening off her cheek as she reminisces about a simpler time before her decision. But despite her best attempts to return to the beginning, her repentance falls on deaf ears. The outcome only worsens. And so she accepts her role.We see the depravity of mankind depicted as social tact is abandoned. When people are stripped naked of society\'s robes and gives into their deepest, darkest desires. Jeanne becomes their catalyst to indulge. Her soul no longer in her possession. Her flesh, an instrument of pleasure. She loses all fabric of her being, and in the process, becomes a force much greater than herself. Like mother nature, she takes her seat among urban legend. A succubus. A pariah. An enchantress of the night. She is lust. A wielded weapon in Lucifer\'s arsenal.She sought out revenge from those that used her only to gain the power to harm them through the act of being used. A cruel irony—God isn\'t the only one with a sense of humor.It all culminates in the throws of a hedonistic free-for-all. Sex partners made of noblemen and street peasants alike. A ceaseless indulgence as bodies melts into each other, creating an ungodly form, no trace of decency surviving the transmutation. A distorted representation of sin incarnate. Sodom and Gomorrah birthed anew. The Devil\'s latest atrocity. He sits their satisfied, looking on at the banquet hall of the finest assortment of human perversion. And positioned squarely at the other end of the table sits his finest creation. A mother of scorn. Jeanne joins him hand-in-hand, unafraid of the consequences anymore. The road towards humanity has long been lost in the shadows as she steps closer to the realm of Gods and Demons. Female empowerment has never had a more terrifying representative. Her wrath is as unwavering as her seduction is lethal. And this is what we\'re left with.There isn\'t a happy ending here. Just another chapter where mankind loses. Whether it serves as a sobering reminder of humanity\'s inevitable self-destruction or just a matter-of-fact depiction of death and sin with parallels of the Great Plague, it\'s up to you to take what you will from it. As for me, it\'s a fascinating film that I always find myself revisiting. Each recounter rekindling my love for it or gleaning something new to cherish. It may not have been a commercial success, but as an artistic statement, its efforts were admirable, sustaining a legacy for all those it has gone on to influence. worst kind of atrocity, is left a wilted rose in her husband\'s arms.

Kanashimi no Belladoona is amovie that the 99,9% of the anime fandom never heard any about. It's really difficut to found it on internet, and that's without subtitles.But it's a shame. Anime creators like Kuhiko Ikuhara, Utena and Penguindrum's creator, has admitted the influence of this movie. So, why is this film so unknown?First of all, it's not a typical movie. It's an avant-garde movie, something you will notice just...saying the animation and art style. Forget the formula big eyes, small nose, the charecters are drawn here in a more european look-alike. The colors maybe brillaint and vivid in some scenes, or depressing in others, following the story and the sensations the movie show. The story takes place in the Middle Ages, in France, and the historical portrait is really accurate.It's the story of Jeanne, a young woman who got the bad luck to born female and poor, and how she gets power, while the lords call her a witch, show us the oppressive situation that women has to live in that era. Searching for freedom and power, Jeanne become more and more an outcast fom the society that mistreat her, and build up aimge of a powerful, terryfing woman, a witch. The social criticize is just brillaint.Yeah, there's sex in this story. We see an evolution, since the sex as weapon to oppress people that the Milord uses, til the sex as a way to break free, gain power or joint a soulmate.With or without sex, Kanshimi no Belladonna is a movie that deserves more recognocition for explore themes as feminism, social hipocrisy, the use of religion as a way to oppress the population, and other ways too, and sexuality. saying the animation and art style.

The few iconic scenes alone, such as her rape early on, leave enough that it is enjoyable even if it is a bit lacking in substance.The art here is interestingly animated. The colors are always interesting to watch, and the animation mostly manages to be coherent despite the psychedelic nature. It is not always especially fluid, and I think that is what it has the hardest time balancing in a way that is totally watchable. I liked the art the most when the fluidity was best, but...it is still nice to look at a lot of the time when it pauses, especially on any beautiful looks of Jeanne. I like the disparity between Jeanne\'s beauty and everybody else; it lends a real power to her character development.Jeanne\'s character as a typically frightfully powerful woman is interestingly played out here - she has a downfall not once, but twice! Jeanne\'s inability to rely on her husband or anyone at all, despite helping them out, makes her a nice tragic character in these downfalls. The baron is all right for an evil role, especially with how he is drawn, but his wife seems to be an especially weak character, suffocating story and enjoyment any time she is present.The story is weak, and not because it leaves you guessing, but rather because it just cannot be told enough with the focus on the art. Since the art does spend a lot of time in psychedelic mode, taking minutes to flesh out basic ideas, it cannot really play up aspects of the story that it could otherwise. This also means that you are left guessing about a lot of aspects of the story.The sound is not amazing, but is pretty much always enjoyable, especially if you like typical hard rock and psychedelic rock sounds. This spends more time sounding like early Deep Purple, but it also manages to sound like early Pink Floyd too. At the end it even adopts a sound like Ecstasy of Gold, but in a more Japanese style. It never excels in any of these modes, but it is never bad in any of them either, and nearly always compliments the art and story wellOverall, this is a rather ""indulgent"" work to watch, rather than something whose story or action you can simply sit back and let overawe you. If you are bored of typical anime and manga, however, this might be a nice little indulgent break. it is still nice to look at a lot of the time when it pauses, especially on any beautiful looks of Jeanne.

This spends more time sounding like early Deep Purple, but it also manages to sound like early Pink Floyd too. At the end it even adopts a sound like Ecstasy of Gold, but in a more Japanese style. It never excels in any of these modes, but it is never bad in any of them either, and nearly always compliments the art and story wellOverall, this is a rather ""indulgent"" work to watch, rather than something whose story or action you can simply sit back and let overawe you. If you are bored of typical anime and manga, however, this might be a nice little indulgent break.', ""Background:Kanashimi no Belladonna, literally translated as 'Belladonna of Sadness' or figuratively as 'The Tragedy of Belladonna' is an avant-garde feature film produced by Mushi Production and directed/co-written by Eiichi Yamamoto in 1973. It was loosely inspired by the 1862 book La Sorcière (Satanism and Witchcraft) by French historian Jules Michelet. It's also the third and final installment in the Animerama trilogy conceived by manga god Osamu Tezuka, but is the only one that was neither written nor directed by him.Story:Belladonna of Sadness tells the tragedy of the beautiful peasant woman Jeanne who was raped by the land baron of her village on her wedding night...after the couple failed to meet marriage taxes. Spurned by her husband, she decided to make a pact with the devil to gain wealth and power, but not without facing certain consequences. Jeanne becomes a suspect of witchcraft, and is subsequently banished from her village by the baron.However, with the village quickly becoming swallowed by the cusp of the bubonic plague the baron is forced to change his heart. Jeanne is summoned and offered the rank of highest noble in return for the assistance of her and the mystical flower. Jeanne's motives were altered by her painful experiences, and she refused to accept such an offer.. which leads to her fate and the pinnacle of the film.The final scene ends with an image of Eugène Delacroix's 'La Liberté guidant le people.' The painting features a female personification of liberty itself, leading a mixture of social classes during the French Revolution. In the film Jeanne finds herself in a similar position, and her impact on society can be compared with that of Joan of Arc, Salem witch trials, and several prominent women in history.This story is depicted rather well throughout the duration of the film and is often told metaphorically with symbolism rather than literally with speech. The nature of it is widely subjective, but compelling nonetheless.Characters:The only truly memorable character is Jeanne, but like the others she lacks any serious development. They exist purely as a representation of the lessons lurking in the shadows of this film.  Jeanne's character in particular appears to represent feminism, and relates to a myriad of prominent women throughout history. Especially when considering her comparison with Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc).Michelet's book La Sorcier which inspired Belladonna of Sadness arguably depicts the story of Joan of Arc, and portrays her resistance against feudalism and the Catholic Church. The similarities with Jeanne can be seen most in the final scenes of the film.Art:The visuals are reminiscent of watercolor paintings and heavily influenced by western art. It often hangs in limbo between realism and surrealism. The quality is fair considering it was produced in the 70s. It has received a 4k restoration which greatly enhances the clarity and colors in the film.Animation:The animation suffers greatly where the art shines. Many of the scenes are depicted by panning across still paintings rather than being animated. This could be seen as a matter of style or budget, but it definitely could've benefited from consistency. Regardless, I think the animation can be forgiven with the era it was depicted.Sound:The music is as funky as the era it came from and varies greatly from the Rock Opera to Psychedelic genre and beyond. It's almost always fitting, and creates indescribable emotions that go hand in hand with the images on screen.Overall:A belladonna is a highly toxic flower, which also stands for 'beautiful woman.' In the past, witches were believed to use a mixture of belladonna and other plants in flying ointment, which they applied to help them fly to gatherings with other witches. A theory for the inclusion of belladonna in flying ointments concerns the dream-like waking state it produces.Much of the scenes in the film are depicted as if the viewer was under the influence of the belladonna flower. Similar to the flower, the film itself can also be interpreted from many different perspectives.In my eyes Belladonna of Sadness holds significant implications regarding sexuality, feminism, religion, and history. It presents a thought provoking succession of metaphorical imagery far ahead of its time, and I won't ever forget the impact it had on me. after the couple failed to meet marriage taxes.

A work worse than that of Mars of Destruction? Do you think you have the courage and the guts to watch it? If you do, go watch Kanashimi no Belladonna without a second thought.Kanashimi no Belladonna, a.k.a. Belladonna of Sadness, is a 1973 alternative animation film. Is it the love story of Jean and Jeanne? Or is it maybe the tragedy of famous french heroine Jeanne D\'Arc\'s life? I\'ll tell you what it is.It\'s the best thing to watch if your dream is to become an anime film director or anything related to that. Also,...it\'s the best thing to watch if you\'re facing depression; it\'s so bad that it\'ll raise your self-confidence so much to the point it\'ll make you happy. Not judging the ones who made this piece of work, of course, because everyone makes mistakes in this life. Maybe they regret this.Also, it\'s the story of a woman losing her virginity to a demon-like priest with a huge cock. The story of a pitiful hot girl who succumbs to the negative power of this world and messes it up. She even gets raped by dogs. Oh, sorry, that was a spoiler. She can communicate with the devil, or she\'s maybe the devil herself. She inspires people to have orgy feasts and sex with animals. Giraffes, fishes, anything you can imagine. There\'s even the story of the Evil Queen from Snow White, and the man who put a stimulant to heighten her sexual senses to force her to make sweet love to him. Spoiler ahead; the priest with the huge cock killed them both. What an excellent film.Oh and before I stop typing because I got more bored than I expected making this meaningless review, I have to mention an unimportant part that included Jeanne dying like Jesus. It was supposed to be what would make the movie better. I\'m not spoiling more to it, there were metaphors and stuff but it\'s undoubtedly the first memory I\'ll forget from this experience, after watching a never ending hour of disturbing frames.The OST was not that bad, weirdly.

It\'s an estetically pleasing and abstract movie about a woman who lost everything dear to her due to her tragic fate and bad decisions in life.If this kind of artistic movie were to be made today, most ordinary anime fans would absolutely hate it. Why? Because of the way it was made. It is almost completely made of moving drawings. In my opinion drawings are amazing though and really express the characters. Another thing that surprised me is the use of singing in telling the story. I don\'t usually like that kind of thing, but...here it was very welcome.This film definitely isn\'t for everyone. It is very slow-paced and its main themes are depressing and heartbreaking. I was blown away by how emotionally heavy all the events were. There are also many sexually explicit scenes which weren\'t all that necessary. I didn\'t like those whatsoever, especially since they were animated in such a disturbing way.To tell you the truth, I don\'t think you should watch this one before bed because you will be scarred for life. All in all, the movie was fine. I gave it this score only because of its art. Other components it was made of, however, definitely weren\'t my cup of tea. here it was very welcome.This film definitely isn\'t for everyone.

The creator of this movie were probably a bunch of men with no idea the nuance of the experience of woman and their sexuality.

"", ""[SPOILER FREE REVIEW]First of all, I apologize for the bad English.Kanashimi no Belladonna is what happens when hentai becomes art. The erotic scenes, here, aren't just sex. Belladonna of Sadness is a real journey through the misogynist universe of Christianity, exploring every single detail of the suffering of women in a sexist society in the most beautiful way that is possible.Story: 10/10The story isn't some Texhnolyze-like complex plot, but it's as sensitive and brainy as. The story follows Jeanne, a christian woman in a truly medieval European scenery (not like Nanatsu no Taizai or Meine Liebe, where there's no representation of the poor people's suffering...by the abusive governments and famine), that wants to get married with a poor guy, but is impeded by the class prejudice, and then get abandoned by him. In the night which Jeanne was supposed to marry, she's raped by some demoniac entity and, therefore, she has no outlet for her awakened libido. The story, like I already said, isn't used to pornographic purposes, but it's a way to report the rape questions, the oppressing structure of marriage, the sexist nature of the religion, the unfortunately very common victim blaming and the sexual freedom of women, which is restricted by the christian society.Art: 10/10The overview of the plot is kinda fantastic, but it can get greater. The story isn't only told by the dialogues and events. It's told by the art too.The animation is a surrealistic-like, semi-static, very beautiful and meaningful art. Some details improves a lot the story, and I can't even imagine the work it demanded.Looks like some drawn poetry, an autistic and eccentric unknown vision of the reality, an artistic way to view the hurt. It's the greatest art I ever seen in anime.Sound: 10/10Even the sound here is, someway, feminist. The musics reports the sexism in every small act of the daily life, and if you understand Japanese, the experience can be even greater.Character: 9/10If I say that, in 1 hour and 29 minutes of pure surrealistic art, the director developed a three-dimensional character, would you believe? So watch it. Jeanne is a god tier character of all-time movies.Each character represents some group of people which is involved in prejudiced relations, and to watch it is to get more empathic.Enjoyment: 10/10It's outstanding. There's three ways to enjoy or not the movie:1. Appreciating the humanist messages and denunciations of this masterpiece;2. Appreciating the not-so-satisfactory pornographic scenes like a masturbation-addicted guy;3. Depreciating the more-than-coherent critic that the movie make to your religion, being a close-minded and limited person.But, in all these ways, it's hard to watch Belladonna of Sadness, and it's good: the movie transmitted to you the feeling it has and is.Overall: 9.9/10It's a journey through the sexist society of Christianity.

A fucking (haha) masterpiece."", ""Loosely inspired by Jules Michelet's Satanism and Witchcraft, a fictionalized history of medieval witchcraft in Europe, Eiichi Yamamoto's cult anime Belladonna of Sadness strikes a perfect balance between midnight-movie enchantment and arthouse sophistication. The plot follows two recently married peasants, Jean and Jeanne (Aiko Nagayama and Katsuyuki Itô), as they deal with the aftermath of Jeanne's rape by a local baron (Masaya Takahashi) and his henchman by right of prima nocta. Jeanne eventually makes a Faustian bargain with Satan (Tatsuya Nakadai), who appears to her in the guise of a playful demonic phallus, which initially gives her vast social power, but ultimately breeds tragic consequences...for the couple.For all its wonderfully gonzo WTF moments, as when the diminutive, phallic Satan slowly grows in stature as Jeanne strokes him, there's also an underlying stately melancholy to the proceedings. The sadistic punishment of Jeanne's body is disturbingly ambivalent, both sensual and sinister, as she welcomes and resists her repeated onslaughts in equal measure. This dualism reflects the film's nuanced view of medieval witchcraft as both a harbinger of feminism and an example of sexual decadence, an act of social transgression that challenged medieval moral and power structures by deliberately embracing what society viewed as an illicit and evil form of behavior.This cult anime strikes a perfect balance between midnight-movie enchantment and arthouse sophistication.The film's visuals consist mainly of panning shots of sumptuously painted tableaus, frequently enlivened by startling movements (both sudden and fluid) in unexpected areas of the mise-en-scène. The animation is decadently expressionistic, inspired by works from the last millennium of European art, particularly the sinuous lines and dark eroticism of Aubrey Beardsley, Gustav Klimt, and Egon Schiele. The scenes depicting war and plague exude a particularly hallucinatory quality; we see the plague literally eating away at the foundations of medieval society, as cathedrals and other monuments of feudal power dissolve into formless wisps of smoke and specters.Belladonna of Sadness nevertheless reflects a uniquely Japanese id, as evidenced by such touches as Jeanne and Satan's lovemaking session, where her hair flows in the ether like the tentacles of an octopus in the ocean. Such elements, along with Masahiko Satoh's incredible psychedelic soundtrack, connects Jeanne's liberation struggle against the authorities of medieval Europe with Japan's contemporary political and social unrest. The visual excesses reinforce the film's underlying attack on the repressive banality of conventional political rule. Jeanne's extravagant sexuality has no labor value in a medieval society that relies on the economic exploitation of the peasant masses; it thus functions as a criticism of the oppressive materialism of a world supposedly dedicated to spiritual values. Embracing evil is her only way to achieve sovereignty in a world where God has become a tool of repression.Jeanne rebels against God as the spiritual embodiment of the patriarchal state that violated her in the form of the baron and his court. This follows Michelet's reading of witches' covens as an early example of popular rebellion against the authoritarian state that would culminate in the French Revolution. Jeanne is a forerunner of the equally liberated Liberty Leading the People, Eugène Delacroix's topless embodiment of the women (in Michelet's conception) who led the populist revolutions that shook Europe throughout the 19th century. And yet, it's a very phallic Satan that endows Jeanne with her growing social and political agency during her rise and eventual fall from the pinnacles of power. If this attempt to link medieval witchcraft with the modern women's liberation movement ultimately comes off as a bit perfunctory and confused, the effort is nevertheless emblematic of the film's largely successful effort to deliver a beautifully trippy mindfuck with some philosophical depth.Critic Review by Oleg Ivanov - slantmagazineOriginal Source: http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/belladonna-of-sadness for the couple.For all its wonderfully gonzo WTF moments, as when the diminutive, phallic Satan slowly grows in stature as Jeanne strokes him, there's also an underlying stately melancholy to the proceedings.

Sometimes the animation is very good and sometimes it looks like the creators just gave up and just have stills. The art is mostly the only good part, but then there was no need to make a film, just make a bunch of paintings... the music was alright. I do praise the art but it really feels like Jeanne only has two facial expressions, which is odd when it juxtapositions her empowerment/orgasm and her humiliation/rape.Mostly the film feels gratuitous with its violence against women. There is no need for so much rape, murder, and brutalization of...random women and closeups of their genitals. There is a whole scene where it's just animated sex and rape of random women all together in a circle on Jean's hair; it feels almost like the creators are getting off to it. I do like when films bring up social issues but this film doesn't do anything with the social issues it brings up. It's just a miserable 90-minute-montage of Jeanne being humiliated, raped, and murdered, that happens to also have pretty visuals. random women and closeups of their genitals.

Maybe the greatest psychedelic cult film ever, second to Yellow Submarine. Belladonna is born out of same fabulous furry freak mindset that allowed for Fritz The Cat exist, except this film takes it to unprecedentedly beautiful and poignant heights. It's like the Bitches Brew of animation. Wonderful, wild, psychedelic, artful, freewheeling, innovative even if it's influence is nowhere to be seen in any other film (but maybe that's to come in the future.) Even at it's most explicit or pandering, it's still meaningful on multiple levels whether it's the...masterful animation, the relevancy of the story/characters, the contrast of music and image or even just the overall tone of the film. I don't even think any of this was intentional by the director, it seems it was meant to be just another disposable hentai film which makes it's poignancy all the more remarkable. A great film not just compared to other anime, but compared to other great films in general (animated or not.) Don't miss this and if you have to give it more than one shot, trust me it's worth it. masterful animation, the relevancy of the story/characters, the contrast of music and image or even just the overall tone of the film.

The artstyle, sometimes muted, washed with watercolor dripping down the screen, and other times loud with vivid reds and greens that pop out at the viewer, is as beautiful as it is haunting. The animation, minimal at best, is slightly choppy but surprisingly very fluid during very specific scenes. It all feels purposefully done, as if to make those scenes stand out even more than the others. The music also serves a very large role, other than the instruments helping to convey the tone of the scene, often the singer will serve...as a dual narrator, as if to spell out the melancholy of the main character as well as the crossroads at which she stands.This isn\'t going to be a movie for everyone. I\'m going to get that right out of the way first and foremost. This is an arthouse film which employed some very experimental techniques at the time, ones which Toei Productions would later employ when they coined the term ""ga-nime"" (an extremely niche and often overlooked style of production which was unpopular and never wide spreading). However, at the heart of Belladonna of Sadness is an experience which reminds me of an emotionally charged, more narratively driven Angels Egg (mostly in its execution, but also religious imagery). If you\'ve seen that film, you\'ll understand how each scene flows into the next with an almost dream-like fever, but that the story is mostly up for interpretation. I\'d argue that the message and the story of Jeanne (the main character of Belladonna of Sadness) and her downfall is very straightforward despite its surrealism.The story starts with a marriage, but after the lord demands more taxes than the husband can pay, his lady proposes that the virgin wife have her purity tainted. After that, nothing is the same for Jeanne as her life spirals after being reduced to an artform for the eyes of lustful men. One criticism I see often is that there\'s a romanticized depiction of her and every assault she suffers, however, I\'d argue that depiction is strongly symbolic to how she is viewed vs how she views herself. During the latter half of the movie after she makes a deal (won\'t spoil it), her body is like a temple, but spirals in many scenes to be this twisted, unholy mass of flesh. And yet, despite all this, one thing I loved about her is that she was still willing to help others even when her cynicism and emptiness became like posion.I wouldn\'t call this a love story. I wouldn\'t even call this a story of revenge. I don\'t say this often because I feel the term has become synonymous with certain unsavory women who\'s extremism has become laughable and reduced to a caricature of what the movement stood for, but this movie has a strong feminist message. I could carry on about the meaning of the phallic imagery throughout, or even her face transposed over the other women in the crowd at the end, but this review is already long. I will say as a closing, however, that it\'s the impact of the story of Jeanne which inspires me, and why I love the ending so much.TLDR; if you enjoy morality tales laced with tragedy and experimental anime, this might be for you—but if you\'re not enjoying it after about 30 minutes, then drop it as a dual narrator, as if to spell out the melancholy of the main character as well as the crossroads at which she stands.This isn\'t going to be a movie for everyone. I\'m going to get that right out of the way first and foremost. This is an arthouse film which employed some very experimental techniques at the time, ones which Toei Productions would later employ when they coined the term ""ga-nime"" (an extremely niche and often overlooked style of production which was unpopular and never wide spreading). However, at the heart of Belladonna of Sadness is an experience which reminds me of an emotionally charged, more narratively driven Angels Egg (mostly in its execution, but also religious imagery). If you\'ve seen that film, you\'ll understand how each scene flows into the next with an almost dream-like fever, but that the story is mostly up for interpretation. I\'d argue that the message and the story of Jeanne (the main character of Belladonna of Sadness) and her downfall is very straightforward despite its surrealism.The story starts with a marriage, but after the lord demands more taxes than the husband can pay, his lady proposes that the virgin wife have her purity tainted. After that, nothing is the same for Jeanne as her life spirals after being reduced to an artform for the eyes of lustful men. One criticism I see often is that there\'s a romanticized depiction of her and every assault she suffers, however, I\'d argue that depiction is strongly symbolic to how she is viewed vs how she views herself. During the latter half of the movie after she makes a deal (won\'t spoil it), her body is like a temple, but spirals in many scenes to be this twisted, unholy mass of flesh. And yet, despite all this, one thing I loved about her is that she was still willing to help others even when her cynicism and emptiness became like posion.I wouldn\'t call this a love story. I wouldn\'t even call this a story of revenge. I don\'t say this often because I feel the term has become synonymous with certain unsavory women who\'s extremism has become laughable and reduced to a caricature of what the movement stood for, but this movie has a strong feminist message. I could carry on about the meaning of the phallic imagery throughout, or even her face transposed over the other women in the crowd at the end, but this review is already long. I will say as a closing, however, that it\'s the impact of the story of Jeanne which inspires me, and why I love the ending so much.TLDR; if you enjoy morality tales laced with tragedy and experimental anime, this might be for you—but if you\'re not enjoying it after about 30 minutes, then drop it', ""A lost cult classic of anime, Belladonna of Sadness is the third film in a trilogy of erotica anime films called Animerama made by Mushi Production and had some sort of involvement from famous anime director Osamu Tezuka from 1969 to 1973 (Tezuka being a producer for Belladonna). Set in a pre-French Revolution era French village, new bride Jeanne finds herself raped by her village's corrupt lord and turns to witchcraft to escape the cruelty of the local lords influencing her village.The immediate thing that will stick out to many viewers of Belladonna is its avant-garde visuals. Many of the visuals are beautifully-done watercolor drawings...that have lush colors and a good amount of detail, with limited animation applied to them. A good amount of the visual sequences are symbolic representations of sexuality applied to Jeanne's tragic situation and eventual acceptance of her open sexuality. The film was made with a limited budget as this was the final animated work made by Mushi before they went bankrupt, but whatever limited resources they had work beautifully with what was done for this film to create a unique psychedelic experience. Just as a fair warning though, some of the animated sequences in Belladonna can trigger seizures for those sensitive to light thanks to light strobing effects applied to them.In regards to plot, Belladonna is fairly straightforward as Jeanne talks with the Devil during the first half of the film to resist giving in to evil, while eventually giving into her inner demons. However, there is far more depth put into this film than what it seems on the surface thanks to its sexually-charged symbolism. Without spoiling too much, the film is a critique on how society can repress women and the lower class, with the Devil in this film not being as evil as the lords would have the villagers believe as he is a representation of the freedom that can be gained if Jeanne and others defy the social order established. However, the film will certainly not be appropriate for younger audiences thanks to its strong violent and sexual content found with many of its animated sequences.While certainly not for everyone thanks to its arthouse-style presentation and sexually explicit themes, Belladonna of Sadness is still a unique lost film of anime history thanks to its beautiful and surreal visual presentation, and sexually-charged symbolism of seeking freedom from an oppressive and corrupt social order. If anime coming from directors like Kunihiko Ikuhara have struck your interest before, then Belladonna is certain to grab your interest here. that have lush colors and a good amount of detail, with limited animation applied to them.

This is not a feel good nostalgia-fest a la Ghibli or Disney. This is - in the purest sense - adult animation.The film revolves around Jeanne, a peasant woman. Early on, Jeanne is gang raped by her village\'s...royalty as payment for permission to marry. Her would-be husband then rejects her, and Jeanne turns to dark magic as a means for vengeance.It isn\'t an easy watch, and it\'s quite clear that it wasn\'t intended to be; everything in the film is meant to offend, disturb, or disorient the viewer. The only beauty comes form Jeanne herself, who is constantly brutalized.So what\'s the film\'s appeal? Why watch something so confrontational and antagonistic? The easy answer is because it\'s a one of a kind experience. You simply aren\'t going to see another film like this, and there is a certain quality that comes with rarity.An answer that is more difficult to properly articulate, but probably more valid, is the inherent beauty that arises despite the ugliness the viewer is bombarded with. Jeanne laying naked in a flower bed during a brief moment of peace, or her final confrontation with the king, standing empowered and defiant. These scenes will embed themselves in your mind.That being said, this is a flawed film. It\'s antiquated, the phrase ""of its time"" seems ridiculously accurate here. It\'s also a niche film, but doesn\'t satisfy many of the criteria its intended audiences may look for: its stilted, unmoving images and adult themes alienating the traditional animation crowds and the fact that it\'s animated at all being a point of derision for serious arthouse fans.But something as different and strange as Belladonna of Sadness is bound to find fans. That\'s why I recommend it despite its flaws. I didn\'t love it, but I won\'t soon forget it. It\'s something I\'d like to own and look at and appreciate despite its ugliness, maybe because of its ugliness and the beauty that\'s hidden in there.

Basically, an experimental animation about a woman who finds liberation through sex and inspires a revolution among the people by showing them to indulge in and accept their sexual desires. The problem is that doing so is combined with her accepting a devil penis, so indulging in sexuality is also connected to evil symbolism. Eventually, the patriarchy comes and ends the party and some pictures of women revolutions are shown to let us know that it\'s meant as an empowering film. If it\'s supposed to be empowering, why have her...be raped by the source of her power? Weird choice. (OK, so it waited for her to say yes, but if that were a person any decent person would have stepped in and said ""Nah, tho."")The art was mostly still, and it was sometimes gorgeous. Animation and color changes were usually used symbolically to show how liberated and free the characters were. Characters exposed to sex got specially colorized, the already powerful ruling class was always colorized. That sort of thing. It\'s certainly unique, but it doesn\'t stand as a big sign that less animation is a special statement or anything. be raped by the source of her power? Weird choice.

You'd really get the whole art experience of this just looking at a collection of screenshots. I'd honestly...say that's worth it, the art style really works when it works.

The watercolor aesthetic especially stood out to me and for the most part was the only reason I kept watching.Story-wise it was difficult to see what kind of ideas were presented. My interpretation morphed as the film progressed. Initially, it seemed as though I was supposed to believe that ""clean and pure women"", in mostly a sexual way (i.e. virgins and post-marital sex ONLY), is what is morally correct and is a woman\'s obligation to god and men. That being sexually abused by a man exploiting his...power can make even an honest, hard-working, ""man\'s man"" of your husband neglect you now that you are ""ruined"".Later on, in seems that in some ways I can see the attempt was to go for a brain shattering take that, huh, maybe sex shouldn\'t be so taboo, and religious superstitions are detrimental to society\'s progress. That, hey!! Women are cool and forward thinkers. see this person in the painting of the french revolution??? that\'s a woman you see there!!But c\'mon.. Jeanne\'s only motivations were to either please her abusive husband so he could stop being sad, fuck satan for magical powers, and to get revenge on everyone who exploited her except for her husband and satan. Which I.. I don\'t understand?Jeanne never had any inherent power and was beholden to some other person to do anything.By the end of it my interpretation became: Women should be allowed to be horny and have sex whenever they want, just like the men do. in fact, if women were allowed this honor, then they can lead revolutions. With one condition: only men can enable their horny-ness; they still live to serve men.....?????????This is backed up by many different interactions between characters.- First, the sexual abuse by the lord triggers the appearance of Satan, the physical embodiment of her libido. now she lusts for Satan because she wants to help her husband get over the fact she isn\'t a virgin anymore and has a wife with sexual trauma. Satan will give her power as long as they smash. Satan is just manipulating her into having sex with him. Satan is the guy that would use the blockchain to get sexual consent.- The page asks witch-version Jeanne to give him a potion that turns the lord\'s wife horny for him because he wants to have sex with her. This is unrequited love, stalker shit.- The villager women talking to the lord and his posse about Jeanne, the witch, say things like ""oh, my husband wants it every night even though I think we can\'t afford more kids.. and I also get lonely sometimes"". -- I don\'t really want this, but I will fabricate a reason to also become guilty so it\'s not all on my husband.- When Jean visits Jeanne to convince her to stop being a witch and team up with the lord, it\'s so he can ""woe is me. please take me back.. i haven\'t had sex in years"" and just thrust himself upon her, but also if she doesn\'t then he will be executed. this is just classic abuser tactics. he ends up getting mad when she\'s being executed which causes him to get murdered and now everyone sees him as a martyr even though he was complete ass the entire time.Look, with all that said I want to be clear that I am not saying people shouldn\'t be allowed to be horny. Anyone can be as horny as they want (to an extent).

Well, that and the beautiful art. But would I recommend this to a fellow anime lover? No.Apart from the beautiful watercolor art, the story lacks character. Maybe that's what it was meant to be, when we stare across the walls of art gallery , we do not know half of the story displayed. Rather it evokes strong emotion according to our persona and past.

You can\'t miss the influences of Peter Max, Yellow Submarine, Andy Warhol, the multitude of the underground cartoonists of the time, all of it. There\'s nothing missing.

There are several different art styles that Yamamoto utilizes and each one was equally as impressive for its own reasons. Soundtrack is also excellent, I found myself mesmerized by the long scenes of visuals and music coinciding into one long visual trip. Seriously, go check out the OST, it's beautiful free jazz composed by Masahiko Sato. Not a good film for casual viewing because although a pretty film, I found the story lacking and developed no real relationship to the characters. These are trivial issues when dealing with a film of this nature however.

I decided to look it up because I thought the name was ""artsy"" and found the art to be absolutely gorgeous. Before you get thrown off by the X rating, just know it\'s not really hentai. The ""hentai"" scenes are the defiling of the main female lead and it\'s probably impossible to get off to due to it\'s graphic and abhorrent depictions of rape. This is true art and is truly indistinguishable from anime besides its language.Story / 7I think the story is not truly the important part here. Basically, a...young woman, Jeanne, gets raped by the local lord on her wedding night because her and her husband, Jean, can\'t pay the wedding toll. She turns to witchcraft then.Art / 10The art is honestly the best part - it is absolutely stunning. It has a very European style to it. It also goes from a very ""papermation"" style to real animation where it moves so smoothly about halfway through the movie. It has very dull colors but I enjoyed it nonetheless as the colors fit.Sound / 9The music is absolutely gorgeous as well. The main theme ""Beradonna"" is absolutely gorgeous and has gorgeous, throaty vocals. ""Funny Feeling"" has a very creepy and almost sinister sound to it and it definitely serves its purpose in the scene it is played during. ""TBSF"" is my favorite out of the whole soundtrack though. It is absolutely gorgeous and though I can\'t truly understand what the singer is saying, it sounds absolutely gorgeous. I loved the soundtrack to this movie so much that I bought the vinyl for it.Character / 8For the very few characters of importance, only Jeanne matters.

The film is also very sexually graphic, and is rated under the Rx-Hentai category on MyAnimeList.• The only thing you really need to know about the story is that the main character marries a man whoーthen sells her to the Devilーwhere she gets raped continuously, and then the remnants of the movieーrepresents her tumultuous journey towards salvation. Jean,...the husband, he mysteriously looks like Roman Polanski, the wife, Jeanne (Sharon Tate), holds physical similarities, and the pastor who marries them, note: suspiciously looks like Charles Manson. This film may be a commentary on the connection between the Manson murders and Roman Polanski at the time (there was a criminal investigation correlating the two back then), but that\'s purely speculation on my part, based on how similarly the designs resembled them.• Rife with a plethora of religious and historical allegories. If you\'re into 2deep4u religious symbolism, like in Neon Genesis Evangelion, than you would love the all show, no-tell-all-show feeling within Belladonna of Sadness. I don’t mean that in a condescending way, I mean, I really like things that resemble this. I gave End of Evangelion a 10/10 for CHRISTsake, because there’s an excuse for a religious pun!• The film contains a lot of stills and there’s BARELY any animation, except for when a memorable scene, primarily without dialogue, takes place. The audio quality is what you would expect of an anime from 1973. I must say that it was jarring to hear the very low pitched voice, saying, ""Kawaii,"" to Jeanne before raping her. The first time I watched the film was raw, too, so it was super weird with no context.• Often called the ""lost Tezuka masterpiece,"" as it is very much in the same vein as Osamu Tezuka\'s adult ventures, such as Cleopatra. Side note: if you want to check out more of Tezuka\'s adult oriented works, then titles like MW, Ayako, and Ode to Kirihito exist and are mandatory reads for old fags and self-proclaimed oldies, like me.• Overall, if you\'re in an overly precocious mood and feel ready to equip the beret that has been collecting dust in the corner of your room (gotta save the pretentious-wear for that one special occasion that you’ve been eagerly awaiting; always) then get ready to show your friends an experience that they\'ll call you a pervert for liking, and then you must retort with a reply that will not put that beret to shame, what every artistic douche is put on this Earth for; stroke your imaginary (or non-imaginary) beard, scoff, and tell them that they don\'t understand TRUE art.

One cannot forget the date at which it was made. Plot is simple and not complicated, but has enough substance to be interesting. In my view it is mainly about finding of women place in society and critique of a man society and its attitude towards women. Visiual style is stunning. Usage of watercolours and black and white ink drawings as well as still images was beautifully done. Altough I would prefert little less still images and some psychadelic scenes, where bit too much for my taste. As far as erotic content goes, some of it was nicely done (I...imagine it was meant mainly as an allegory for women status) but some scenes where unnescessary. But overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it (but mainly to those seeking little bit unconventtional anime experience). imagine it was meant mainly as an allegory for women status) but some scenes where unnescessary. But overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it (but mainly to those seeking little bit unconventtional anime experience).', 'Belladonna of Sadness, loosely based on the 19th century novel La Sorcière, is a fantastical work that laments the misogyny endemic to patriarchal society as much as it celebrates feminine resilience. The rather simple tale should overall sound familiar to anyone with a basic knowledge of the history of witchcraft and perceptions of women’s sexuality in Europe, yet a couple of interesting choices set the film apart from precedence. As the film initially depicts sex as a tool for oppression and debasement with her ‘deflowering’, Jeanne’s eventual ability to wield sex as a tool for healing and liberation is a triumph. The final reveal that...Jeanne’s prideful spirit is what inspires the women who led the French Revolution centuries later also elevates the story where it connects Jeanne’s personal struggle to the struggle of her gender as a whole. Even if Jeanne inevitably meets her demise within a draconian feudal society, she sows the seeds for liberation and doesn’t die in vain.Story notes aside, the Belladonna’s chief cinematic achievement is its incredibly vivid psychedelic animation. Consisting mostly of side-scrolling watercolor panels, the animators adeptly capture raw sexual trauma, grim loneliness as well as erotic, fantastical bliss in beautiful fashion. Specific animated motifs add much meaning to the very sexualized dynamics of the film - the phallic shape of the akuma (devil) who rapes Jeanne, the flower which Jeanne uses to heal the woes of the villagers. It seems the movie is broadly saying while men may see sex as a tool for power, possession and control, women view sex as a healing spiritual force that bonds people together.There’s so much incredible detail in Belladonna of Sadness that the film is probably worth multiple views.

The time you can tell was put into the art is commendable and the music is just as good as the art.The story opens up with lovers, Jeanne and Jean who plan on getting married under a society where economics and your ability work hand-in-hand, and happen to be in debt. As punishment the Village Lord rapes Jeanne and continues to ruin both their lives.Jeanne reunites with her lover after the assault under the pretense that he is there to comfort her but he begins to strangle her.Now here is where my...interpretation of the happenings in the film get a little muddy. I believe she was either left unconscious or killed after the fact and that is when the Devil manifest itself. Jeanne offers her body to the devil in exchange for power and while the village is at war Jeanne and Jean become quite prosperous. However, as many dealings with the devil go, things began to take a turn for the worst.When the king returns from war his queen informs him of Jeanne\'s newfound popularity and respect amongst the villagers and she is quickly labeled a witch (which isn\'t too far off...).Review:I feel this point in the synopsis is a perfect place to start my critics of the film, as well as things I enjoyed.So up until Jeanne is thrown into the ""dungeon"" the events of the film are easily discernable despite it\'s animatic medium, however the sequence that takes place at this point is still confusing after a 2nd watch. I assume she was either still in the dungeon, her husband helped her escape, or she was never in the dungeon and she just offers the devil her soul right after the fact. Whichever it may be the plot becomes very muddy and convoluted from here on out.Jeanne makes herself Satan\'s bride and a powerful witch and her presence is quickly made aware of to the villagers. Hesitant at first, they begin to adore her and the village slips into a world of hedonism and sexual deviancy.Skipping across the plot a little because a summary is pointless at this point if not to provide context to my review, Jeanne is captured and brought before a crowd to burn at the stake for being in league with the devil. Jeanne watching her burn and die attacks the Lord and armed guards in a fit of rage, which is confusing. His character isn\'t very consistent, he\'s manipulative and has stabbed Jeanne in the back more than once but we are supposed to be convinced that he loves her and its mutual? The villagers assimilating with Jeanne\'s demonic soul and taking the face of her metaphorically was a bit on the nose and towards the end the film had me thinking a lot of its themes were on the nose but its fine.All in all it was a worth while watch, I don\'t think I\'ll watch it again because the payoff really isn\'t worth the length of the film (It\'s not so lengthy as it is boring) but I thoroughly enjoyed the unusual medium it chose to tell its story with.

The color palette for this movie was a real stand-out point. The way the bright colors mesh with such a dark and at times hard to watch film creates such an interesting contrast. The movie feels like watching an animated watercolor painting, which is something I’ve never seen done before. When the art style for this film hits it hits hard, as some of the scenes just radiate creativity and artistic freedom. There are many shots and scenes that I feel like...I will personally never see again. The soundtrack for this movie also amplifies a lot of the scenes as the score really fits the almost psychedelic or whimsical visuals/experience. Some of the tracks really feel ahead of their time in terms of sound and are a major highlight of what this movie does extremely well. The hyper erotic scenes depicted in such an artistic and creative way made for a truly unique visual experience, even though at times it felt like too much. Looking at the negatives, there are times when the hyper stylization of this film really gets in the way of the story, where it makes it difficult to understand what is going on and difficult to connect the plot lines as the story goes over a lot in the hour and a half. At times this movie also seems more like watching a voice-acted painting than watching an animated movie. There are a lot of scenes that have no movement at all to very little, though taking into account of the movie being made in 1973 the times when it is animated are actually very well and look quite smooth. There are a few scenes though that do look quite dated, especially in the beginning of the movie. Belladonna of Sadness is definitely not the easiest watch because of the content shown in the film but is one of the most unique watch experiences anyone will ever have. If I could explain this movie in only a few words it would be “psychedelic softcore porn.” I will personally never see again.

Why that is you ask? Simply because it's filled with trippy acid visuals, A very novel and psychedelic approach to storytelling that I've never seen and it actually has minimal animation too. What I mean by that is most of the movie is just pictures that convey stuff. Yet I still think this movie managed to engage me as a viewer and I was not bored...at any moment. It has a very Avante Garde vibe (If you're not familiar with this term, It basically means that it shows events and depicts them in a very unorthodox manner, different from conventional means). This type of storytelling may not appeal to everyone but it certainly has it's charm.Keep in mind, This movie is a very adult oriented movie. It's basically a feature length sexual innuendo of a movie, while on paper that sounds very bad no? But the execution here is nothing short of amazing. I seriously think this is a marvel of animation and everyone should watch this atleast once.It follows the Tragic story of young woman named Jeanne, What follows in her life is nothing short of earth shattering. A very gruesome movie that does not hold back in showing what will happen, A very bold approach by the director. I was left disgusted, happy yet satisfied by the end of it. To make me feel all of that, within a span of 86 minutes is a sign of a good movie.Watch this if you want a unique one of a kind experience, A very thought provoking movie that seems filled with sexual stuff but is more than meets the eye.What shocked me the most is that there was an empowering message for Women at the end of it.Seriously a good watch, Would recommend if you can stomach the gore and sexual imagery. Definitely not a kiddie friendly movie. at any moment.

I swear half the movie is just stills and panning shots making the movie feel like a glorified slideshow. While I\'m a fan of trippy shit, the trippy sequences in this don\'t do it for me in the way they did in Evangelion, Perfect Blue, or insert Yuasa work here for what I assume are budgetary reasons. The music is arguably a positive but I wouldn\'t consider it a major...selling point. There\'s little characterization and what\'s there is uninteresting which makes it hard to care about what happens to anyone.The story is pretty bland, largely because little happens for large swathes of the movie, but unlike many ""deal with the devil"" stories where you might expect the person who makes the deal is corrupted morally either as a literal religious message or metaphor for the ends not justifying the means or power corrupting, Belladonna is a tragic heroine story where the woman who makes the deal is pretty much morally in the right the entire time. She is executed by her rapist, the greedy lord who\'s the reason Jeanne made a deal with the devil in the first place, after refusing to make a compromise and be his second in command for working with the devil in spite of only using her power to help people presumably because feudal France hated the idea of a woman having power not granted to her by a male ruler.You can probably imagine why the movie is named after a poisonous plant named beautiful woman for its cosmetic use that also has been used medicinally and why the devil tells Jeanne that he is her and she is him. The theme of women\'s mistreatment in feudal France culminates at the end where Jeanne\'s execution plants the seeds for the French Revolution by awkwardly cutting from the mostly/entirely female crowd\'s face turning into Jeanne\'s to paintings of the French Revolution with text saying that women played a key role in it.However, actually having a theme doesn\'t make the viewing experience engaging, especially one as banal as ""medieval Europe had issues with women"". For a movie this sympathetic to Jeanne even if the deal with the devil is meant more as symbolic of how her society viewed Jeanne achieving power without relying on the male ruler it\'s still awkward that she makes a deal with the devil because it makes the audience expect she\'ll end up more evil than she actually does. You generally don\'t expect a movie to portray the death of someone who sold their soul to the devil as tragic so it feels inconsistent. Her only potentially morally ambiguous acts are her helping a guy date rape the lord\'s wife who was complicit in his crimes and had it out for Jeanne and helping a married couple have sex for reasons other than procreation which you might recognize as one of those sins everyone ignores because it shouldn\'t be one in the first place like eating shellfish.tl;dr the movie has enough going for it to not be bad but not enough for me to find it engaging but I can see why someone would get more out of it. selling point.

That's why I think most of these are very nicely metaphorized.Still, the metaphors get a bit weird towards the end of the film. Worm or snail, I don't see that they have a side to be likened to sexuality, but I'm not...cruel enough to break the score I'll give to this film for one scene.Speaking of cruelty, I think cruelty is often the main character of the film and the devil's harassment scenes are staged to show that Jeanne has no one to rely on and tries to comfort herself. After all, the devil introduces himself as Jeanne throughout the film, measuring Jeanne's innocence over and over again and finally not being able to bear the torture inflicted on her by people is nicely addressed.This uselessness and aesthetic masturbation, which is just for sexual scenes, caused me to lower the score of this film.I have to say that the film takes sound from instruments such as cello, piano, violin and guitar. But these playing melodies were so emotional and conveyed the feeling. Sometimes I heard the sound of progressive rock music in the songs that played, specifically King Crimson's music, but sometimes the instruments reminded me of Anatolian rock music.

Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED Destiny,https://myanimelist.net/anime/94/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_SEED_Destiny,"[""Sometimes, sequels to popular series work. Most of the time, they don't. Destiny was one of the latter.STORY - The fact that this is a direct sequel to a Gundam series already puts Destiny's story at a disadvantage. Think about it -- all Gundam series start with war and end with resolution. Thus, SEED had resolution, and the only way for Destiny to begin is by destroying that resolution. And it has to be a cheap and forced-feeling destruction because there's hardly two year's difference between the end of the first series and the start of the sequel since they wanted to reuse a majority...of the cast. So yeah, we're not off to a great start here. Admittedly, it is near-impossible for me to view Destiny as a standalone series, and as a huge fan of SEED, I know I'm prone to being a lot more critical than usual on its sequel. And that's me admitting to my bias upfront.Moving on. Destiny seems to try too hard in mirroring many circumstances and storylines already present in SEED, making them seem forced, unoriginal, and repetitious. (If SEED already had a few recycled storyline elements, then certainly Destiny has them in spades.) The basis for the new war seems trivial compared to the previous, and all the countries far too eager to participate in the conflict considering their hard-won peace. The twists were too predictable. Surprisingly significant and unexpected character death was one of the greatest merits I found in SEED, and Destiny tried to perform the same tricks. Unfortunately, these attempts all failed as almost all the character deaths in this sequel could be seen a mile away. The final resolution at the end of the series is also weak and rushed.In all, I can think of very few story element that surprised me or that are worth mentioning on grounds of praise. Even the ones that were kind of interesting -- such as the replacement double for Lacus Clyne -- were overshadowed by the lackluster quality of everything else (and unsubstantial character development as addressed below). I feel like I should maybe elaborate more here, but there really isn't much else to say, and specifics are hard to point out without invoking spoilers.CHARACTER - SEED had a fantastic cast of realistic and noteworthy characters. Destiny took those existing characters and warped them into sub par, flat versions of their former selves, or else twisted them so badly that they were hardly recognizable. And Destiny's newly introduced characters hardly make up for it. I found Shinn, our brand new protagonist, incredibly difficult to sympathize with, which is never a good thing. His background seemed far too much like a generic sobstory, and his fixation on his own tragedy made him out to be too narrow-minded and self-righteous. Done right, those might have been interesting qualities for a protagonist, but for Shinn, it only made him incredibly annoying to put up with.Kira, the initial protagonist of SEED, had been flattening as a character since halfway through the first series. In Destiny, he reached the height of one-sidedness. He is self-righteous to the extreme and seems to think that only his morals and way of dealing with things is the correct one. In some ways, this isn't an entirely bad thing -- it just changes his role within the series, I suppose. He transforms from one of the main protagonists into a more secondary character that contributes one viewpoint without variation. Perhaps he'd just reached the point in his development when he doesn't need to change anymore. Still, it may be frustrating for some to see a once-fleshed out character become so generic, even if he remains a fantastic foil to Athrun.And Athrun? Of the original cast, he is certainly one that retains a majority of his previous characteristics. His multi-faceted personality is intact, and his emotions remain complex. Once again, he is a very interesting character to follow as he is caught between a conflict of both morals and ethics and the alliance (or lack thereof) between his friends. With both Shinn and Kira on their respective high horses with unwaivering opinions, Athrun serves to contrast with the both of them and again offers the same inner turmoil that he provided in SEED. Essentially, Athrun is the same character that he was tossed into a &quot;new&quot; setting, but as the similarity of his situation forces similar reactions, those who've already seen SEED aren't really getting anything new at all. And then there's the matter of romance...It's almost comical how many female characters are thrown at Athrun in Destiny; indeed, it seems like all the girls except Stellar are utterly in love with him. This might have been more amusing had he not already had a perfectly good and stable relationship with Cagalli, and had they not been &quot;broken up&quot; for no good reason at all. The entire romantic ordeal seemed like a cheap (and completely pointless) shot at riling up all the fangirls and boys and to reject the already canonized pairing established in SEED. Certainly Athrun and Cagalli's relationship was put under stress in Destiny, but I found a lot of it to be rooted in a lack of communication that was entirely unreasonable. In an age of mechas and space colonization, I can't imagine it would have been too difficult to send a quick email now and again. If nothing else, the number of new suiters for Athrun reinforced his feelings for Cagalli, but the entire subplot was a waste of time because we knew that already.As well, Cagalli is ridiculously out of character in Destiny. She goes from being a headstrong and independent girl to being a political pawn. Certainly she faces some pressuring circumstances, but considering her development in SEED, it would have made more sense for her to tackle them with head-on rather than...anything she decides to do instead. It's extremely disappointing to see her take such a step back and for her to devolve into such a generic &quot;save me, I'm a weak girl&quot;-type character (especially since we already have one of those in Destiny). It just didn't make sense to me. I'd read somewhere that Destiny had controversially employed a mediocre writer that was in a relationship with one of the producers and that much of the poor character renditions were a direct result of this person, but I can't confirm this for sure. Whatever the reason though, Cagalli was among one of the biggest disappointments here.But finally, there's the matter of all the other characters. The remaining carry-over characters from SEED are casted as less complicated versions of their former selves, though most of this can be attributed to the fact of their diminished significance beyond practical roles (captains, pilots, ship controls, etc). The other new characters introduced in the series are mostly reincarnations of characters that didn't make it to the sequel (Stellar and her companions take the place of SEED's druggie trio, new masked guy takes the place of old masked guy, Captain Gladys is almost identical to Captain Ramius, etc), which further supports the idea that Destiny is just an uninspired rehash of the original SEED. Otherwise, they were generically casted archetypes, including the blindly loyal devotee, the bubbly spaz girl that is willingly manipulated, and the political figure with ambiguous intentions that aren't really that ambiguous. Certainly a few characters are interesting -- Stellar is actually a fairly intriguing character that grows and changes with the story -- but like any interesting story elements, they're largely overshadowed by everything else.PS - There is also the matter of the resurrection of a character that dies in SEED. This was completely unnecessary and ruined a perfectly touching and emotional death. Come on, no more of this I-survived-but-lost-my-memory bullshit, please.ARTSTYLE &amp; ARTWORK - Thankfully, the art and animation did not change between SEED and Destiny. I'm still fond of the particular style used in the series, and everything else stayed in that average range that's perfectly acceptable.MUSIC - Considering the general failure of the above sections, I was especially grateful that the music in Destiny lived up to SEED's, which I absolutely adored. The composer and most of the artists involved remained the same, and thus, beautiful music ensued.  T.M. Revolution returns to perform fantastically upbeat and energetic pieces, including the first opening theme (&quot;Ignited&quot;), just like last time. Nami Tamaki also returns to provide its first end theme &quot;Reason,&quot; as well as a number of insert songs. And SEED threw young Nami Tamaki into the j-pop spotlight, Destiny did the same for Hitomi Takahashi, who sang my absolute favorite opening for the series, &quot;Bokutachi no Yukue.&quot; Additionally, Rie Tanaka, the voice of both Lacus Clyne and Meer Campbell, sings both a super-energized remix of her &quot;Shizukana Yoruni&quot; from SEED and a slow, peaceful, and absolutely gorgeous new song, &quot;Fields of Hope.&quot; And last, but not least, Rie Fu, who did the famous first ending of Bleach (&quot;Life is like a Boat&quot;) comes in to sing &quot;I Wanna Go to a Place,&quot; possibly my favorite ending theme in Destiny. Seriously, I adore all of the vocal tracks used in this series.And of course, Sahashi Toshihiko once again provides four new soundtracks worth of fantastic orchestral and piano music for the background. These include updated versions of old, familiar tracks, as well as dozens of new themes that are just as fun. And as a piano player myself, it especially pleased me to see the inclusion of more piano tracks that are actually played within the content of the series since Rey Za Burrel takes Nicol's place as your character-that-can-play-piano. Fun stuff all around, guys. :DVOICE ACTING - All of the actors that reprised their roles from SEED were once again excellent. I still love Akira Ishida as Athrun Zala. Of the new roles, Stellar stood out to me as a pretty awesome performance given the strangeness of her character. Other than that, the rest of the voices did well to fit their part, but weren't anything particularly memorable. As far as I know, Destiny hasn't even been released Stateside (probably because of SEED's strangely dismal failure), but it did have a Canadian release, so I assume there's a dub out there that I haven't seen. I imagine it'd be pretty much the same as the SEED dub though, which was very average.OVERALL - Almost everything about Gundam SEED Destiny annoyed me, and though I'm not sure how high my expectations were in the first place, I don't think I could have been more disappointed with this sequel. Other than the technical aspects (sound and animation), nothing lived up to the standards set by its predecessor. Maybe if it were judged as a standalone work, it would score a little higher (especially on the character scale), but as a direct sequel to a series, I don't really see the point.

It astounds me sometimes that some fans of SEED actually enjoyed Destiny, 'cause in the end, Destiny, for me, only served to reinforce the idea that sequels to perfectly good series are utterly unnecessary."", ""Destiny is a tale of two shows, the show it could have been versus whatever the hell the staff of the show presented it as.  To get to the point, I&rsquo;ll point out the shows main problems immediately.  The show&rsquo;s pacing, character development and plot I felt were all horrible and on top of that unoriginal.Destiny started off better off than any Gundam series I&rsquo;ve watched so far.  While most series in Gundam canon usually start off slow and tedious.  Destiny gave you some brief, but useful enough introductions.  The age old practice of stealing Gundams right from under the...enemies' noses was fine, I chalked that up to them paying homage or going with a tradition.  And then you were thrown headlong into the action.  Pacing was pretty good throughout the first half, while they developed this somewhat annoying formula of action, followed by character development episodes, the action was good enough to make you put up with the way stuff was spaced out.  A particularly enjoyable part of the show was the interaction between Athrun and Shinn.  Though whiny, generally ignorant and pretty arrogant, he showed signs of hope, realizing at times that Athrun&rsquo;s advice and tutelage had helped him for the better.In the second half of the series, the trend continued, but with far less interesting action.  The Gundams became over powered and the later battles seemed inconsistent and unfair at times.  Also, the change in focus about half way through meant that you had to sit through the same babbling that permeated the original SEED, but this time its just a rehash of their already stated opinions and can&rsquo;t be counted as character development.  Clip shows and flashbacks were also used EXCESSIVELY and killed pacing.  The worst pacing came towards the end, as entire episodes seemed wasted on minor characters or minor developments and MORE flashbacks, only to have a very short, rushed feeling ending that seemed to have a lot of out of character moments, but that&rsquo;s an issue for the next paragraph.Destiny showed signs of good characters and good character development.  Instead of getting a patchwork group of out of place soldiers and refugees, you get professional soldiers in their element, facing extreme challenges (except for Arthur, I don&rsquo;t know how he became an XO).  Durrandal started to become my favorite character that, even though he showed signs of being evil, was just a very smart, sharp character with a lot of charm and who made a lot of sense.  Shinn though a professional soldier is whiny and arrogant.  Captain Gladys seems like a character with logic and a good amount of insight into the world.  Athrun shows up as a conflicted character, who ends up being a mentor to Shinn.  And tries to show him what is wrong with his impulsive and arrogant attitude.Unfortunately, the interesting characters of Destiny are replaced halfway through with the much less interesting characters of the original SEED.  And then the previous cast gets a serious downgrade in on-screen time, skills and even intelligence.  The characters from SEED seem like less than objective observers, until they start meddling and screw everyone over.  The characters of Kira and Lacus show no change, nor room for it.  Athrun changes, but only in the way a pendulum does.  It takes him an entire series to come to the same realization he had in SEED, war is bad, no one should be killed and hatred will destroy the future.  The characters come off as almost god-like, knowing all, looking down on the world and generally being untouchable, literally.As for the new cast-away cast, once they are pushed to the side, you don&rsquo;t know whether the director wants you to root for them or not.  They go from saving the day, to be viewed as oppressors in the span of an episode.  On top of that, their skills and intelligence seem to change as the episodes go along.  In one episode, they are able to practically fight off the entire Orb military by themselves, later in the series they are unable to take down Orb even with the entire ZAFT military behind them and with Shinn and Rey using upgraded, super powerful Gundams.  The Alliance was able to take down Orb in the original series even with Kira, Athrun and the Archangel present, yet ZAFT receives a brutal punch to the nose and retreats.  This is also in contrast to when they fought the Alliance earlier at Heaven&rsquo;s Base.  With no less than 5 Destroy Gundams (mountainous Gundam death machines with more weapons and armor by itself than most militaries), they pretty easily take their objectives.  Even earlier than that in the series, one Destroy Gundam was enough to hold off both Kira and Shinn by itself.The worst case is the final battle, where everything comes to a head.  The same ZAFT that pretty easily defeats the entire Alliance, and takes their super weapon for themselves, gets a resounding defeat by a pretty small Orb force in what has to be the worst Gundam ending ever.  Their ace pilots are easily chopped up, the Minerva is defeated, not by the Archangel, but by a restored Mu La Flaga in his overpowered (Hyaku Shiki rip-off) mobile suit.  And in the end, three major characters on the ZAFT side decide to cash it in and commit suicide, while two more lie on the surface of the moon, next to their destroyed mobile suits crying.My final gripe is with the overall plot of the show.  Sure it started off pretty simple, but it then threw a pretty nice twist at viewers, by dropping a massive celestial body (Junius Seven) on the Earth at the beginning arc of the show instead of during the last two episodes like most shows.  Great!  Then the plot goes into the basic war itself between the Alliance and Z.A.F.T.  Once the Archangel starts screwing with things though, it becomes a slower more convuluted plot.  And when it gets near the end, it just seems to become nonsensical and chaotic.  It really isn&rsquo;t that complicated and there aren&rsquo;t many surprises.If the point of the show was to show that repeating one&rsquo;s mistakes was foolish and stupid, then this show proved that perfectly.  Then didn&rsquo;t just repeat the stakes of the original SEED, which was a good show in its own right, it doubled them.  Great character and mecha designs and potential are wasted by the flawed plot and logic.  And this show has left me disappointed to say the least. enemies' noses was fine, I chalked that up to them paying homage or going with a tradition.  And then you were thrown headlong into the action.  Pacing was pretty good throughout the first half, while they developed this somewhat annoying formula of action, followed by character development episodes, the action was good enough to make you put up with the way stuff was spaced out.  A particularly enjoyable part of the show was the interaction between Athrun and Shinn.  Though whiny, generally ignorant and pretty arrogant, he showed signs of hope, realizing at times that Athrun&rsquo;s advice and tutelage had helped him for the better.In the second half of the series, the trend continued, but with far less interesting action.  The Gundams became over powered and the later battles seemed inconsistent and unfair at times.  Also, the change in focus about half way through meant that you had to sit through the same babbling that permeated the original SEED, but this time its just a rehash of their already stated opinions and can&rsquo;t be counted as character development.  Clip shows and flashbacks were also used EXCESSIVELY and killed pacing.  The worst pacing came towards the end, as entire episodes seemed wasted on minor characters or minor developments and MORE flashbacks, only to have a very short, rushed feeling ending that seemed to have a lot of out of character moments, but that&rsquo;s an issue for the next paragraph.Destiny showed signs of good characters and good character development.  Instead of getting a patchwork group of out of place soldiers and refugees, you get professional soldiers in their element, facing extreme challenges (except for Arthur, I don&rsquo;t know how he became an XO).  Durrandal started to become my favorite character that, even though he showed signs of being evil, was just a very smart, sharp character with a lot of charm and who made a lot of sense.  Shinn though a professional soldier is whiny and arrogant.  Captain Gladys seems like a character with logic and a good amount of insight into the world.  Athrun shows up as a conflicted character, who ends up being a mentor to Shinn.  And tries to show him what is wrong with his impulsive and arrogant attitude.Unfortunately, the interesting characters of Destiny are replaced halfway through with the much less interesting characters of the original SEED.  And then the previous cast gets a serious downgrade in on-screen time, skills and even intelligence.  The characters from SEED seem like less than objective observers, until they start meddling and screw everyone over.  The characters of Kira and Lacus show no change, nor room for it.  Athrun changes, but only in the way a pendulum does.  It takes him an entire series to come to the same realization he had in SEED, war is bad, no one should be killed and hatred will destroy the future.  The characters come off as almost god-like, knowing all, looking down on the world and generally being untouchable, literally.As for the new cast-away cast, once they are pushed to the side, you don&rsquo;t know whether the director wants you to root for them or not.

And this show has left me disappointed to say the least."", ""The Gundam meta series is colossal in size, and the fanbase splits are arguably even bigger than the franchise itself. Get any two Gundam fans into a room, and you're bound to find some difference or another that would make a big enough difference.You have fans of Universal Century, 00, Wing, G, Turn A, SEED and X, all of whom like something about their respective series/timelines that they feel other fans cannot see.Most/almost all of the above fans, however, including fans of SEED, have a notorious reputation for particularly hating Destiny, which is rather surprising since Gundam fans are notorious for not really being able...to agree on anything.Why is this the case in such a fanbase?Well, the story is incredibly unoriginal. Gundam storylines don't tend to have much in the originality department as far as themes are concerned, but SEED Destiny takes it to a whole new level. The story is a cheap rehash of SEED and Zeta, the characters are clones of the Zeta cast, the mech designs are unoriginal and uninspired, almost all of them taking something from a mech design found in some other Gundam anime, and the characterization that the characters went through in the first SEED is out the window for the sake of the plot...and it doesn't work. At all.Oh, and the characters are equipped with enough plot armor to (literally) survive a nuclear explanation, in what is easily among the most immersion breaking aspects I've ever seen in anime thus far. This makes absolutely no sense in a war story, much less one that takes itself as seriously as SEED.The war aspect in this story is a walking joke. The characters are rather petty, shallow and immature, and none of them feel or act like actual soldiers in the slightest. The first SEED had some incredibly slow but subtle development in the form of Kira slowly but surely maturing of the course of the show, slowly becoming more composed and natural in battle. This disappears very quickly, and the characters reset to their former characters, except that the flaws which were so prevalent and the characters worked hard to fix in the first SEED are out the window.The animation quality looks awful, and repeated frames from both SEED and Destiny are present here. Yes, there is footage practically stolen from SEED and it is incredibly painful and intolerable to look at. The flashbacks were already a problem in the first SEED, but this is taken up to 11 here and every 5 minutes (on average) a flashback to someone or something has to be there. Particularly notorious is Shinn's tragic past which gets repeated so many times that I would just roll my eyes when it shows up.The soundtrack is the only thing I loved about SEED Destiny, with tracks from TM Revolution, See Saw and so on, giving us one of the best soundtracks out of anime. The fourth opening deserves particular mention (in the original version of SEED Destiny) for being among the most awful and ill-fitting openings of all time, and the character models in the opening are not dramatic but rather hilarious to look at.Honestly, why anyone likes this broken mess is beyond me. I can rag how this breaks the themes of the original SEED, how this ruins the resolution to SEED and the reasons for the war starting are plain damn stupid compared to SEED, but honestly, if there is one thing I can say, it's that you stay as far away as humanly possible from this.This is bad. I cannot stress enough how far away you have to go from this. The only reason anyone would watch this is if they hated the original SEED and simply decided to have a laugh at this...thing.For everyone else, avoid this like the plague. to agree on anything.Why is this the case in such a fanbase?Well, the story is incredibly unoriginal.

As a french guy it\'s not always very easy for me.If you\'re wondering why a review on Destiny before Seed, I will answer. Seed is good and fun. It\'s not perfect, but it\'s a good Gundam show. Now, let\'s jump to the main topic please...Destiny. I\'m warning you, I\'m spoiling a lot of things, so if you hate that, just skip my review. Oh and also, this review\'s gonna be much longer than my other review.Story: Oh boy...Okay let\'s do this. When I started Destiny, I was hoping that the first half of the show will be more paced that...Seed, because there was a lot of time wasted in the first half of Seed. Destiny started with an easy cliché: hijacking of three evil-looking Gundam except the heroic white-blue-red Gundam. But even with that, it was fast paced and very fun. Then the drop of Junius Seven came and what a great idea this team production had. Yeah it\'s the same old big nasty thing that fashion spacenoids, oops sorry, coordinators want to throw on the evil Earth Federation, oops sorry again, I mean Earth Alliance. But again, even with that, it was making sense and it was thrilling. Then a little bit of the problems started. Those guys who are dropping Junius Seven are not crazy racists, they are more like canon fodder for Shinn and Athrun that get killed in 5-10 minutes. Then, Junius Seven is torn apart, but they are still huge pieces that  hit the Earth and cause massive damage to a lot of cities (Québec is one of them. Why Québec, that\'s not very far from my own house). The Minerva lands on Earth and they get to ORB since it\'s a neutral country. ORB ally themselves with the Alliance, blah blah blah, they are trying to sink the Minerva, blah blah blah, they can\'t since Shinn has the Seed Factor and he kicked their asses in a spam of 10 minutes. Quess what? The show is actually very good. From episodes 01 to 12 it\'s entertaining and I was thinking: If it continues that way, it\'s gonna be way better that Seed. Boy I was wrong. Kira comes back... in a boring episode of Jesus Yamato with God-modish-Gundam that destroyed a lot of ZAFT junk. This is where everything is drowning. The focus on the main cast (Minerva) is shift to the old cast (Archangel). Some peoples said it\'s like Zeta when Amuro came back when the A.E.U.G is on Earth. But here\'s the difference. Amuro got some screentime, but Kamille was still the main character. In Shinn\'s and Kira\'s case, it\'s jumping to one way to the other. When Kira is nowhere fighting, Shinn is the good guy, but as soon as Kira is fighting, Shinn becomes the bad guy. Then a lot of stuff happens, blah blah blah, Kira kills love interest #1 of Shinn, Shinn gets angry, blah blah blah, Shinn obliterates the Freedom and is predictible-tactics-pilot Kira. He obviously survived. Shinn gets a new Gundam and tries to kill Athrun and miss him with an anti-ship sword to a grunt suit. Kira gets a even more God-modish-Gundam: Strike Freedom. Shinn is angry and whinny, blah blah blah, flashback episodes in the last straight of the show. Seed\'s last battle *copy* and *paste* on the last battle of Destiny: METEOR smashing fun. Shinn got his ass kicked by Athrun like he was nothing  and Kira got a perfect on Rey\'s Legend Gundam. Durandal dies and peace is restore thanks to Kira and the crew of the ship-of-nonsense. Wonderful isn\'t it. You know what is the worst in all of that, Cosmic Era is one of the few side universe of the Gundam serie that have a huge potential in terms of story and conflicts. Because when you look on paper the story of for example G Gundam and Gundam 00, Seed had more potential. G Gundam: a tournament of Gundam fights. Gundam 00: a group call Celestial Being are making armed intervention to stop all the war in the world. What\'s the problem with the Seed universe then? Flashbacks everywhere, weird way to develop characters, weird idealogies and clip show episodes. That\'s the reason why the story of Destiny sucks a lot. Hold on, I have just finish the story part.Art: If there\'s one thing that I liked about this show it\'s the art. Yes, yet again, it\'s Hisashi Hirai\'s character design. I know a lot of people had a tough run with him, but I liked his way of doing character and c\'mon at least they are very well animated. I know some people had big problems with the Gundam design in this show, but let me say that I like most of them. I will always prefer the Impulse to the Strike. The Saviour was awesome, the three Gundams that got hijacking were cool too. The Freedom is beautiful even if I hate his pilot and the Destiny Gundam is probably next to 00-Raiser my favorite Gundam of all time (good god his wings are f****** great). On the lame note: Strike Rouge is still around (ugly pink painted Gundam), Legend is the Providence of this show and there\'s nothing original about him. Akatsuki is a Hyaku Shiki with Providence weapons and is kinda lame too. Strike Freedom is a stupid upgrade, the Infinite Justice is...the Justice with few new weapons and the Destoy Gundam(s) are just failed PSYCO Gundam. As for the grunts, I didn\'t mind the homage to Zeon for ZAFT, but they looked less advanced that their previous design. The CGUE and the GuAIZ are all looking more advanced that the Zaku and the DOM. The Gouf were cool, but again they look less advanced. The Alliance has again their ugly GM and the Windams were just piece of crap. ORB and their mass-produced Zeta, the Murasume, were also cool looking, but they explode like they were nothing.Sound: The soundtrack of Destiny is good, but it\'s not the best compared to Kenji Kawai almost perfect score on Gundam 00. The openings of Destiny are high budget music, low budget animation. For the most part, the first three openings are good in their own (the second is the best althought). When you get to the last opening, you have two possibles reactions: you cry in agony or you just laugh with a disgusting face. The endings are great too except the third one.Characters: Are you ready for it?! Let\'s start with something, with two words: complete downfall. There\'s an essential rule in anime: the characters you see in the first-two episodes are the main characters. Let\'s analyze characters by characters.Shinn: The greatest idea of this entire show. A trained pilot (not an accidental one). A Gundam lead that pissed you off! Finally something interesting, not one of those whinny-emo kids that are indecisive and don\'t want to pilot Gundams anymore *cough*Amuro*cough* *cough*Kira*cough* *cough*Kamille*cough*. The problem is that is developpement went nowhere and the show focused on Kira who doesn\'t change at all. A good opportunity waste by the director and the writer to show a different take on a lead character.Kira: Oh boy... what a pain in the ass that Kira. He wasn\'t my favorite protagonist in Seed but he changed and he realize the errors he had done during the run of the show and I liked is developpement. But, I just can\'t stand him in Destiny. He\'s the perfect guy who knows everything. Why war is war, why that is way is the better way, blah blah blah, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. He\'s Lacus Perfect-Iceman-Bodyguard and they are supposed to be lovers. I\'m sorry, they aren\'t. I always thought that his relationship with Flay was better even know that she was psyco and was using him. The worst part is how he became lazzy with the Strike Freedom. Kira has skills, but he just used the beam spammer button of his mobile suit, which is boring giving the fact it\'s all stock-footage animations. An other thing that annoys me is the fact that after the war, he\'s the same guy at the end of Seed. He never changes, so what\'s the point of having him as the main character after episode 12. Fail idea there.Durandal: A great leader with the charisma of Char Aznable (Suuichi Ikeda always awesome in everything he does). I know he was gonna be the big boss at the end, but it just seemed way to forced. It\'s like, oops, now that Djibril is gone, guess we will give him everything. Here... take Requiem and NEO GENESIS and you can start your Destiny plan (wich is the most stupid plan ever). A great character waste again.Athrun: That troubles my mind also. He obviously wanted to come back to ZAFT after what Durandal told him about what he should do. When he joined the Minerva, Shinn is angry against him for being promoted as a FAITH member given the fact he had just returned from ORB after two years. But they eventually sort go along together and that was great, since it was like a mentor-apprentice friendship. But when Kira appeared, Shinn is angry against Athrun yet again and for no reason at all. Then, after Kira talked to him, Athrun started to questionning the path he chosed. Quess what? Around episode 35, he wants to escape ZAFT for going back to Kira and his amazing friends. Basically, Athrun, in that show, was a punk.Lacus: I can call her perfect-virgin-Lacus, but maybe I\'m to harsh with her. She\'s not that annoying compared to his ""lover"" Kira. Nothing really that needs to be mentionned, except one thing. If the director wanted Kira to have the focus, why not killing her. Even if I doubt they\'re in love, Kira obviously care for her. If she had died, that will have give Kira good reason to fight and discover who wanted to kill her.Lunamaria: An other great character that doesn\'t get a lot of screentime. She\'s a cool tomboy and a kind person. She\'s not the best pilot, far from it, but  she deserved more that what they give her.Cagalli: Ouf... she was a little bit annoying in Seed, but she wasn\'t someone who just talked, she was willing to take her courage and fight for what she believed. In Destiny she became a weak-whinny-cry-baby. At the end she redeemed herself a little bit by giving that Yunna-bitch a little lesson of honor, but after she gived the Akatsuki to Neo and she broke with Athrun, which is really weird, since they were the last good couple of this show and they were no reason at all for them to broke. Oh yeah... Athrun needed to go with Meyrin, WTF seriously.Djibril: Just a cheap racist-vilain and way to one dimensional.Heine: He was doomed but c\'mon give this poor character a chance to shine a little bit. I don\'t mind him dying, but more like at the end.The three Extendeds: less effective that the one from Seed, they are just there for filling hole. Stellar and Shinn relationship was kinda bizzare to. One encounter and they are depply in love. I don\'t buy that. One thing that would have work: Stellar changes side with the help of Shinn and since Durandal is a master in genetic, he could have saved her.The entire Archangel crew: Just subpar.Enjoyment: It\'s though to enjoy something like that. They are just so many things that went wrong in this show. The battle were boring (stock-footage of Seed and new scenes used in the beginning to the very end), anything that wasn\'t a Gundam was a piece of crap and exploded instantly, time wasted on flashback and clip show. I think that we saw Cagalli\'s father more in Destiny as a flashback that alive in Seed and how many time that we have to see Nicol getting baseball bat to oblivion even know it has nothing to do with the actual story.Overall: To those I offend and to those that think I was to forgiven, here\'s my final comment that will please everyone: I cannot say enough good things about this show. I just hope that this team will never work on a Gundam project again, because they create a dark spot on an near perfect franchise (okay G-Saviour is the worst). If you want more of the Seed universe, there\'s various manga like Gundam Seed Astray. I cannot comment on them since I didn\'t read them, but I heard they were pretty good. There\'s also this little ONA of three episodes call Gundam Seed C.E. 73 Stargazer. It\'s very good stuff for a 45 minutes show. Seed, because there was a lot of time wasted in the first half of Seed. Destiny started with an easy cliché: hijacking of three evil-looking Gundam except the heroic white-blue-red Gundam. But even with that, it was fast paced and very fun. Then the drop of Junius Seven came and what a great idea this team production had.

An other thing that annoys me is the fact that after the war, he\'s the same guy at the end of Seed. He never changes, so what\'s the point of having him as the main character after episode 12. Fail idea there.Durandal: A great leader with the charisma of Char Aznable (Suuichi Ikeda always awesome in everything he does). I know he was gonna be the big boss at the end, but it just seemed way to forced. It\'s like, oops, now that Djibril is gone, guess we will give him everything. Here... take Requiem and NEO GENESIS and you can start your Destiny plan (wich is the most stupid plan ever). A great character waste again.Athrun: That troubles my mind also. He obviously wanted to come back to ZAFT after what Durandal told him about what he should do. When he joined the Minerva, Shinn is angry against him for being promoted as a FAITH member given the fact he had just returned from ORB after two years. But they eventually sort go along together and that was great, since it was like a mentor-apprentice friendship. But when Kira appeared, Shinn is angry against Athrun yet again and for no reason at all. Then, after Kira talked to him, Athrun started to questionning the path he chosed. Quess what? Around episode 35, he wants to escape ZAFT for going back to Kira and his amazing friends. Basically, Athrun, in that show, was a punk.Lacus: I can call her perfect-virgin-Lacus, but maybe I\'m to harsh with her. She\'s not that annoying compared to his ""lover"" Kira. Nothing really that needs to be mentionned, except one thing. If the director wanted Kira to have the focus, why not killing her. Even if I doubt they\'re in love, Kira obviously care for her. If she had died, that will have give Kira good reason to fight and discover who wanted to kill her.Lunamaria: An other great character that doesn\'t get a lot of screentime. She\'s a cool tomboy and a kind person. She\'s not the best pilot, far from it, but  she deserved more that what they give her.Cagalli: Ouf... she was a little bit annoying in Seed, but she wasn\'t someone who just talked, she was willing to take her courage and fight for what she believed. In Destiny she became a weak-whinny-cry-baby. At the end she redeemed herself a little bit by giving that Yunna-bitch a little lesson of honor, but after she gived the Akatsuki to Neo and she broke with Athrun, which is really weird, since they were the last good couple of this show and they were no reason at all for them to broke. Oh yeah... Athrun needed to go with Meyrin, WTF seriously.Djibril: Just a cheap racist-vilain and way to one dimensional.Heine: He was doomed but c\'mon give this poor character a chance to shine a little bit. I don\'t mind him dying, but more like at the end.The three Extendeds: less effective that the one from Seed, they are just there for filling hole. Stellar and Shinn relationship was kinda bizzare to. One encounter and they are depply in love. I don\'t buy that. One thing that would have work: Stellar changes side with the help of Shinn and since Durandal is a master in genetic, he could have saved her.The entire Archangel crew: Just subpar.Enjoyment: It\'s though to enjoy something like that. They are just so many things that went wrong in this show. The battle were boring (stock-footage of Seed and new scenes used in the beginning to the very end), anything that wasn\'t a Gundam was a piece of crap and exploded instantly, time wasted on flashback and clip show. I think that we saw Cagalli\'s father more in Destiny as a flashback that alive in Seed and how many time that we have to see Nicol getting baseball bat to oblivion even know it has nothing to do with the actual story.Overall: To those I offend and to those that think I was to forgiven, here\'s my final comment that will please everyone: I cannot say enough good things about this show. I just hope that this team will never work on a Gundam project again, because they create a dark spot on an near perfect franchise (okay G-Saviour is the worst). If you want more of the Seed universe, there\'s various manga like Gundam Seed Astray. I cannot comment on them since I didn\'t read them, but I heard they were pretty good. There\'s also this little ONA of three episodes call Gundam Seed C.E. 73 Stargazer. It\'s very good stuff for a 45 minutes show.', 'Gundam SEED Destiny is a direct Sequel to Gundam SEED. It\'s been rated as the worst Gundam anime ever. I highly beg to differ. It\'s not much as a sequel, but as its own anime, it\'s outstanding.STORY - 8/10To be honest, you shouldn\'t under any circumstances watch Destiny directly after finishing SEED. You\'ll see nothing but the same, and with SEED always stuck in your head, the good parts of Destiny\'s story are going to be left out. In fact; forget everything you know about Gundam SEED except for the coordinator-natural stuff, as well as the guys who played some large roles in the...first series.Once all that\'s out of the way, Destiny is a blast. It managed to maintain a fair amount of action while giving it what could be called a more ""lively"" story. Half of SEED was just a bunch of guys in a ship trying to get resupplied, Destiny did that differently, in the way that the main characters are on the offensive this time. Ok,the story was above average, to put it simply. It\'s not as terrible as many think.ART - 8The mecha designs were unique and memorable, as expected from SEED. The animation style was easy to look at and settle into, and the character designs for the new characters aren\'t 100% generic and cliche.SOUND - 10I\'ll come out and say it right now: The soundtrack was the biggest pro of Destiny. I\'ve never gotten so much enjoyment out of a Mecha OST that I did in Destiny. And it did something pretty unique here: It made the ending songs better than the opening themes while keeping the OPs excellent. Sound effects and etc is something nobody really pays attention to, so I\'m going to ignore that part. Voice Acting is in the same section.Characters - 6By far, Destiny\'s weakest aspect. Some teenager\'s family dies (because of his sister\'s cell phone (which he blamed on the federation), dedicated his life to taking vengeance for his family (Narutards should recognize that character setup) and joined the Z.A.F.T military, the SEED version of Zeon. The rest of the characters were left half-developed, and were all uninteresting from the start. The only character worthy of note was the new Chairman of Zeo- Z.A.F.T, who was one of those characters who acted like a living saint, but was really just preparing a plan that would trash people\'s lives for the greater good.Enjoyment - 10I enjoyed it a lot. I don\'t know why I enjoyed it so much, but I did. Certainly more than a lot of other people did.Overall: I was left wanting more. A lot more.

I WILL COVER THE HD REMASTER.*It's not a secret that I'm not the biggest fan of SEED. Even still, there's no doubt that the SEED series as a whole could`ve been epic. Season 1 laid the foundation for an even more dramatic and depressing Gundam series to spring up, on the level of Zeta, in more ways than one. This quote represents this perfectly. SEED Destiny in particular also made itself an interesting template that, under the right hands, would`ve...made one of the most critically acclaimed Gundam shows of the franchise. However, it failed on that massively (something the score on this review and the show`s MAL score can attest to), and instead, we ended up with one of the most commonly loathed series of the franchise, among other infamous Gundam series like Victory and G-Reco, and considering the Gundam fandom`s infamy for holding internet wars about whether SEED, Wing, 00, Original, or Zeta is the best Gundam series, on the level of Star Wars v Star Trek, that is both impressive and depressing. So, what makes this series so bad? What the hell happened to make us hate this one so much? Well, let's find out, shall we?STORY: 1/10This is the most depressing part. Keep in mind, that doesn't mean there is nothing redeemable to the story. Moments like the reunion of Athrun, Yzak, and Dearka, are powerful, and the Kira crashing the wedding scene, the arresting Yuna scene, and the killing Djibril scene are glorious. It's just a shame that those moments are SEVERELY outnumbered by moments of bad decision making, contrivances and plotholes, and plagiarism, often in moments where the series tries to be at its most dramatic.  I can't respect a story that has me shouting the obvious answers at the screen demanding that these dumbasses do something right for a goddamn change, and episodes 28 and 32 are the prime examples of this, and I`ll touch on that in the characters section.The war here is started for stupid reasons: assholes from Earth and ZAFT ravaging Earth and the PLANTs respectively via terrorism because of a stupid grudge held by Blue Cosmos and certain ZAFT goonies from the war prior. Characters start existing to die or constantly fail, others make stupid decisions that result in lots of death, and the ZAFT guys start thinking that interfering between the two sides is stupid, despite the fact that that was how the heroes in SEED ended the war, and how they'll do it here. The first and last few episodes directly rip off from SEED, like how the heroes resolve the war in the last few episodes, and how Mu La Flaga stops a giant beam from destroying the Archangel. We also have Kira and Athrun fighting in rage due to a misunderstanding, how Athrun loses a friend and immediately starts fighting Kira again afterwards, and Kira disarming someone who was about tho blast through the Archangel`s front, all of which rip off from the same scenarios that happened in SEED. Back to Mu. He died in SEED, like, deader than dead. Apparently he's back as an amnesiac villain known as Neo, and there is no decent justification for this, as this is the worst case of Studio Sunrise's trademark character revival, as they brought back someone who died in one of the more emotional moments of the previous series.It`s crap like this that makes this story impossible for me to care about. Fatal blows to cockpits of mechs fail to kill (BULLSH*T) (happened 3 times), and seemingly non-fatal injuries result in death just to make Shinn have feefees (said mockingly). The Kira v Shinn fight is the dumbest Gundam fight I've ever seen for reasons that I won't cover here; this review is long enough as it is.The ZAFT guys for some reason cannot understand what the Archangel crew is trying to do despite the fact that it is literally the same thing that they were doing in thr latter half of SEED, which is even worse considering that Athrun can`t make it out either despite being part of what happened immediately above! Episode 32 (the death of Stella) and to some extent, the Shinn x Stella subplot is a direct ripoff of the Four death and Four x Kamille subplot from Zeta respectively! ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL MOMENTS IN THIS STUPID ASS SERIES IS A GOD DAMN RIPOFF!!!Plus, the ending is so unsatisfying, that they had to remake it for us almost immediately afterwards! Plus, for some asinine reason, they give us 3 RECAP EPISODES! 3! Sure, they have increasing amounts of relevance and new footage, but 3 of these in a 50 episode series is inexcusible! It was close to a 2, but the ending was the final nail in the coffin to the destruction of the story`s credibility.CHARACTERS: 2/10Looks like we're not out of the cavalcade of cum-stained crap! Let's talk about the characters! Let's start with the returning guys. Kira is basically a meh protagonist who basically got PTSD at the finale just to give him some depth aside from the fact that he at one point has to find his friend again. He isn't as infuriating as he was in SEED, but he isn't interesting or complex either, probably because he's just a boring Gary Stu now instead of an insufferable hypocrite Gary Stu, though he is still a terrible character nonetheless. For the first 20 episodes, Athrun kept his role as the best character in SEED, until he starts assuming that Cagali isn`t even trying to do her job, acts like a bigot in the middle episodes (about as much as his ZAFT allies), and becomes wishy-washy. Lacus and the other guys are the same though, except for Mu, or rather, Neo. He is a sympathetic villain who cares about the subordinates he has that were genetically engineered for war (Auel, Sting, and Stella), even though he often relies on shady equivocations, and when captured, he slowly remembers his real past after being hounded about it by the Archangel crew. Yzak was at least more humorous and interesting than in SEED, and Dearka's basically same as always.As for Cagali, she is downgraded the worst! Now, all she does is while, spout her ideals, fail, and repeat until she finally does something to take down a douchebag (named Yuna) in episode 40. She has the weakest will of the whole series, and hat`s impressive considering the new cast. Plus, for some reason, whenever she tries to intervene, she doesn't try to disarm despite how easy and obvious it should be for her to do so, and how badly IT BITES HER AND HER ALLIES IN THE ASS WHEN A LOT OF THEM DIE AS SHE CRIES TO THEIR DEATHS DUE TO HER SHEER STUPIDITY!!! In season 1, she at least had a strong resolve, and there, she was less incompetent. Now, she sucks! Way to go, Destiny!Shinn takes the award for worst Gundam protagonist ever, and given that we have Kira Fucking Yamato, that says a lot! His family died in the previous war (when he was stated to be 12) over a year ago, and because of it, he is a total sh*t-stain who blatantly disrespects idealists and his superiors (age 16, and yes, this is a knock against the story). He acts especially horrible to Cagali, and as such, as has earned the sheer hatred of many, including myself. Lunamaria started out as the fun, quirky, and cute one, until episode 22, and she basically becomes weak. Lame. Rey was never that interesting, but at the beginning, he was a good friend to Shinn, and ends up being the mediator often, becomes a crazed devotee towards the end. Auel is some douche who goes through one breakdown 2 episodes before dying. Sting was the more reasonable one of his trio who had a cocky side, until he becomes a generic crazed loon in the same episode he dies in. Stella is psychologically broken (going insane at mention of possible death), yet surprisingly innocent, especially when around Shinn. Too bad she had to die.Heine only exists to spout some jovial dialogue and die in battle due to poor decision-making. Yuna is a pathetic cowardly loser who eggs on Cagali and is a total tool, and I`m glad Cagali arrested him. Djibril is probably the most horrible person in all of Gundam, trying to kill every single Coordinator (especially civilians) for no reason other than selfish desire for profit, and commits major atrocities against entire civilizations in episodes 32 and 43, until he gets eradicated epically in episode 43. Chairman Durandal is a man with a realistic and bleak outlook on war, but becomes the final villain of Destiny who decided to take a stupidly unrealistic approach to ending the war. What a waste. The Minerva crew members I didn't cover are meh. They don't harm much, but aren't that interesting. Meer on the other hand, IS interesting. She went through surgery in order to have a job impersonating Lacus, including singing, and personality, but is ditzy, and can get annoying at times, aside from her sad death. Funny enough, most deaths in this series are still competently tragic, but even then, this cast of characters still sucks.ART: 3/10The artstyle isn't much better than it was in SEED, but the faces and facial expressions are at least somewhat more tolerable overall. Plus, Lunamaria has some priceless facial expressions in episode 22. The CGI is as bad as ever, albeit mercifully less prevalent, and the mech designs a d fights are as solid as ever. Plus, the lasers are still great. It`s basically everything I've said about SEED, only slightly better. At least it uses orange and fiery environments better for some well done and varied mech shading. The reused animation is festively bad since not only do they reuse animation in the OPs and many battles like SEED does, but they sometimes directlhbrip stock footage from SEED, including during the OPs! Just...what the hell?!SOUND: 6/10All of the OPs in this show were great, and that is one advantage this has over SEED. OP 1 (Ignited) by T.M. Revolution is a fun OP to start off the series with. It`s kickass. OP 2 (Pride) by High and Mighty Color isn`t as good, but is catchy enough. OP 3 (Bokutachi no Yukue) by Hitomi Takahashi is definitely a great one as well. OP 4 (Wings Of Words) by Chemistry is a soothing and catchy OP, even if it has no business being the OP of a serous mecha war drama. HD OP 4 (vestige) by T.M. Revolution is a great one yo cap off this series with, due to how climactic it feels.  All f the EDS (except 3 and including the HD ones) were great and catchy, and in some cases, rather emotional too, like Life Goes on (by Mika Arisaka) and Kimi wa Boku ni Niteiru (by See-Saw). The OST isn't amazingly memorable, but can be emotional and fit the scenes really well too, with some really well used tracks (like the one used for liftoff)The dub still isn't good. The equipment got better, but the returning VAs (especially Athrun`s) didn't, and the new guys didn't feel right either. It`s not as horrid as the one for SEED, but it's not good either. I wonder why they decided to dub both this and the original, since many of the actors did not suit their roles or sound right even in suitable roles.ENJOYMENT: 4/10The action in this series is as solid as ever, and there are still some funny and even powerful moments in this series. Too bad it likes to piss me off more and make many of its episodes feel double length. Cagali and Shinn make some boneheaded decisions that make some deaths excruciatingly panful to watch due to how easily they could've been prevented. The contrivances, plotholes, and etc. were downright aggravating as well, as I mentioned in the story section. It makes it so disappointing to watch, as with even the slightest of logical tweaks, many of these moments would've been so much better, and for all other reasons above, this series gets upsetting really often.OVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 34/100This is one of the worst Gundam anime I've seen to date, and that in and of itself is a tragedy considering how epic this series could`ve been. At this point, I have nothing new to say, but I hope this makes you understand why this show receives such a bad rep. It may have also left a blemish in SEED's reputation that probably led to some guns pointed in SEED`s face. It fails as everything it tries to do, aside from having some fun mech action, which isn`t enough to carry a mech show, let alone a dramatic one that tries to show just how amoral and depressing war can be. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu. made one of the most critically acclaimed Gundam shows of the franchise.

Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu."", 'Gundam Seed is one of the most beloved Gundam series of all time. Ever since it’s a success back in 2002 it has gained a big following especially in Japan where it was most successful. The series has been praised for amazing music, engaging plot twist as well telling an intriguing story where two close friends are in the opposite side of the battlefield fighting each other. While Gundam Seed Season 1 didn’t impress me all that much with its storytelling and characters it was still a fun watch despite being average. Once I was done with Gundam Seed I decided to check out the...squeal called Gundam Seed Destiny. Now unlike the original series many people especially hardcore Gundam fans seemed to have a polarizing reaction of Seed Destiny where it’s very diverse. Camp A is the people who loved it consider it to be one of the greatest Gundam shows ever made while Camp B are the people who despise it with a burning passion. What camp am I in? Well after watching Seed Destiny twice I can say that I am camp c the people who were fine with it however despite my being in Camp C I still don’t Seed Destiny to be a good whatsoever, however, I don’t think is as bad something like ZZ Gundam and Gundam Build Divers.Story.It is the year Cosmic Era 7.3 the leader of orb Cagalli arrives at armoury one to discuss the construction of new mobile weapons with the chairman of the plants Gilbert Durandal. During the discussion, the earth alliance phantom pain special forces completely raid an armoured base and steal three new Gundams. In response to that Cagalli bodyguard, Alex Dino aka Athurn takes one of the new Zakus in attempt to fight back against the stolen Gundams. During the conflict, a brand new mobile suit named the Impulse Gundam mergers from the sky to join the fray piloted my Shin Asuka who has a massive hatred of Orb of what happened to his family during the Bloody Valentine war where they got killed. After fending them off Cagalli, Athrun, Durangel board the Zaft warship called the Minerva where continue the fight against the phantom pain in space, During all this, a group of radicals remain loyal to Patrick ideals commenced a vile plan to drop Junius Seven drop into the earth. Minerva and ZAFT tried they best to stop it and managed to break it into small pieces. Unfortunately, the small pieces that they made still caused massive damage everywhere on earth. So after the earth alliance retaliated by ditching out nuclear missiles, the second war commences between the factions only this time orb teams up with the earth alliance. Kira, Lacus and the archangel gang shows up to try to prevent the fighting. Athrun returns to Zaft to fight once more and Shin, Rey Luna and the rest of the Minerva crew must now fight against the Earth Alliance as well deal with the Archangel to survive and succeed in the new war.Since the creators of the original seed decided to take elements of the original Gundam series the creators of this decision to take story elements of Zeta Gundam. There was a quite a lot of parrels between this show and Zeta Gundam. Shin and Kamile lost they parents due to the hatred for a certain faction, Four and Stella are unstable subjects that fall in love with the protagonist of the respective series, the first battle is in a colony, veterans from the previous series return to help the new cast grow and so and so though. However, despite the show borrowing a lot story aspect from Zeta Gundam I feel like they were executed very poorly as not only Gundam Seed Destiny is a poorly directed piece of shit that is filled with terrible writing but the show seemed to not understand of what made these elements of Zeta Gundam so good in the first place as the show especially the final quarter seemed to a complete reversal of these elements to a point it’s become cringe-worthy to watch.Unfounally this is just the least of my problems of Seed Destiny there’s a hell of a lot more wrong with Seed Destiny story wise.One of the first biggest mistakes that Seed Destiny makes is how it’s very similar to its prequel. Yes, there were differences every now and then but a lot of the time I get the sense of familiarity. It’s is embarrassingly notable in the final quarter of the series which was a rehash of the final battle of Seed but downgraded thanks to the shitty ending.The flashbacks from the original seed but it’s somehow even worse as half of the episodes of the series contain least one or more flashbacks scenes and because of all the pacing is at best incompetent as hell where the show could have greatly reduced its flashback in favour of probably establish it’s plot elements correctly which this show does not do that at all.On top of this show preachy themes that for the most part barely mattered in a long as well the shows terrible directing, script and even dialogue then you got on hell of a bad show in your hands that doesn’t know what it’s doing half of the time. While the first half was at best mediocre and at worst incompetent, it’s the second half especially the final 11 episodes is where the show competently shits the fan writing and directing wise to a point it comes insufferable to watch and it actually gave me a headache…Let’s not forget about the disgusting plot armour in Seed Destiny because of you see any chararters from the original series would not die any circumstances because the plot has to screw over the new characters by making do dumb things that would likely get them killed or my personal favourite have the chararters survive explosions for no reason that is never explained in the plot whatsoever.This is all because Gundam Seed Destiny is a horribly written fanfic has no idea of how to use it’s a new cast in the plot let alone having a function that doesn’t contain character wish-fulfilment aka Kira and Lacus.2/10Characters.When it comes to the character cast for Seed Destiny I have almost nothing positive to say about them due to them being poorly managed.Let’s start with the new characters first. I will save Shin aka the so-called protagonist for last.I start with the Phantom Pain trio.Sting may be the most clam of the three but his also the blandest of the three.Auel is a crazy girl who has mother issues. That’s all I can say about himStella is a decent character overall as she has quite a bit of character development thanks to Shin. She may be a poor man’s version of Four but the end of the day I rather have her than almost any character in Seed Destiny. Too bad were at a certain point of the series something nasty happens to her that ultimately cause the downfall a certain character that I will mention in a bit.My favourite in Gundam Seed Destiny is without the question is Talia. Talia is basically Murrue done right as she’s a not only a competent captain for the Minerva where she’s is a brilliant combat strategist but she actually has guts to punish her crew members if they did something wrong. The thing that puts her in my favourite Gundam chararters list is that completely immune to Lacus Clyne Mary Sue bullshit. After that speech on Orb that Lacus gave everyone in the Minerva crew was in a panic everyone in their mother was going around that ”Oh my God there’s Lacus Clyne who the real one holy shit” while Talia just came out with a dead serious face and said ” ah guys what the hell it’s the big problem it’s not like Lacus Clyne is our commanding officer or anything” Thank you Talia for putting that stupid situation to rest.She’s easily the best thing to come out from Seed Destiny and her presence along really made the show less tedious to watch.My second favourite chararter in Seed Destiny is Meer. She is basically chosen to be the next Lacus Clyne in replace of the old one who went missing in the first Bloody Valentine War and she ended up getting corrupted by her own fame where she starts to realise that she just needed to follow her own dream and not the dream of another.Now start talking about the big 3 of the Minerva crew starting with Lunamaria.Wasted Potential is the best word to describe Lunamaria.When I first saw her I thought she will be a badass Gundam pilot that has a love interest for the protagonist. I wanted her to be great but no instead what I got is a subpar Gundam chararter who for no reason likes to fanboy to Athurn as well being irrelevant to the story. Such a shame because she should have been great.Rey, for the most part, is just there. Apart from being Shin’s voice of reason he barely anything in the overall plot as the same chararter from start to finish. He may be connected to the previous villain from the original seed but the plot element was so badly directed and uninspired that you couldn’t frankly give a shit.Finally we have Shin himself and to be honest he’s probably the favourite new chararter in the show outside of Talia and Meer. I know that’s an unpopular opinion since, after all, he was an immature douchebag through half of the series but I don’t he is bad as everyone says he least for the first half. I mean I prefer him over the likes the old chararters that return for this show aka Kira, Lacus, Cagalli etc.In the first half, we see Shin developing as a character as he not only learns to control his anger but he slowly starts to develop relationships with his crew members.Unfortunately as the series progresses my opinion of Shin takes the turn for the worst and by the final quarter of the show he devolved into unsympathetic one dimensional manic where the series completely shits on Shin chararter development from the first half.Now with the new chararters out of the way let’s talk about old characters because I have nothing positive to say about them whatsoever starting with my favourite girl from the original seed Cagalli.What the hell happened to you went from being this badass tomboy girl in the original to this borderline useless Damsel in Distress who loves to cry and whine a lot.My disappointment doesn’t end there Athurn from being a cool character in the original to this clueless idiot who doesn’t know what he’s doing halftime as he constantly likes to switch sides because of plot reasons.I also never forgive him for ditching Cagalli over Luna sister Marie who btw who barely anything in the narrative other to a fangirl of Athurn.Now we get the worst things about Seed Destiny as a whole. Kira and Lacus. I didn’t care for them all the much in the original seed but I thought were meh chararters in the original however in Seed Destiny Kira and Lacus are nothing but shallow and preachy mary sue idiots. Not only these two were annoying as hell which they wried preachy dialogues bur overtime theses two slowly to take overthrow the protagonist after episode 39 Lacus and especially Kira seemed to the main chararter staus while Shin and the rest of the Minerva crew seemed to devolve into a villain role…Because of these two idiots, I despise Kira and Lacus in Gundam Seed Destiny.Overall the chararters in Gundam Seed Destiny were badly managed and poorly executed.2/10Visuals.When it comes to the visuals of Seed Destiny is almost identical to the prequel but downgraded.The art may look a bit cleaner and sharp compared to the original seed buts all I can say about it.The character designs haven’t really improved at all as most of the characters facial wise look identical to each other when you take off the hair and eye colour.The mecha designs in Gundam Seed Destiny let’s just say uninspired as many of the Gundam seed destiny seemed to either taking straight from the U.C timeline aka the Zakus or shamelessly just adding a few features to preexisting mobile suit from original seed and calling them new mobile suits. Cough Strike Freedom and The Saviour.Don’t get me started with the train-wreck that is the Destiny Gundam good god this is second worse Gundam I have ever seen only losing to Gundam 00 Diver from Gundam Build Divers. Not only Destiny was inspired by 6 other mobile suits from past Gundam series but its portrayal in the story is hot garbage as it was piloted by an angsty pilot Shin Asuka. Also, let’s not talk about how Shin tried to use palma fiocina hands to catch beam savers in the second last episode. That shit was so infuriatingly dumb to watch it gave me physical pain…The only Gundam design that I actually liked from Seed Destiny is the Infinite Justice because not it’s was very original in terms of design but portrayal in Seed Destiny was amazing. The Infinite Justice was so good that I consider it one of my favourite mechs from the Gundam franchise.Outside of the Gundam designs, the ship design for the Minerva is one of my favourite ships in Gundam because not only it was a very well designed shit that is filled with life and identity but the interactions in the ship were so much better than the White Base of the cosmic era aka the Archangel. Also, the security of the Minerva is so much better than the Arcangel.Now lets to the actual animation which is by far the second worst thing about this show right behind the god awful story.If you thought the likes of Gundam Wing, Macross 7, Sailor Moon as well it’s prequel series was bad with stock footage. Oh man, you’re are in a real treat when you watch Seed Destiny.I personally don’t mind if the show uses recycled footage from previous episodes. But no. Oh no no no.They actually it to a whole new level where they take footage from the prequel and slap it to this show with no changes whatsoever. THAT IS FREAKING LAZY!!!It’s so bad they had to recycled footage for some of the god damm openings sequences.It’s like the staff of Seed Destiny blew the budget so can get highly talented voice actors. If you’re planning to watch Seed Destiny make sure to bring a group of friends, beers and make you have a drinking game where you take a shot for every recycled footage in the show inducing when the show has a new opening sequence. If you can do that then you are going to have a great drinking session while watching this shit feast of a Gundam show.As for the overall formula is it’s now at its all-time worst as most of the fights the Gundam just destroy the enemies suits likes flies and because of that not only that most of the battles are tedious to watch they are also not fun at all.Overall the visuals were very disappointing when compared to the original and the animation is without a doubt one of the worst I have ever experienced not just for a Gundam but in a mecha show period.3.5/10Sound.Thankfully the soundtrack is still the best part of Seed Destiny. I really loved all the tracks that play in the show especially the interest songs that play in certain episodes.All the opening and ending themes are still good as ever minus Wing Of Words aka the 4th opening.Now for sub vs dub.The sub is still good as ever as both the new and returning Seiyuus did a solid job with the roles they were given.The dub of Seed Destiny was average but it’s didn’t really stand out all that much compared to the subbed.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall I can safely say that Gundam Seed Destiny is not only a bad Gundam show but it’s just a plan bad anime in general.The plot was awfully written, most of the characters were utter shit and the visuals, for the most part, were lacklustre. The only good things about Seed Destiny are the music, voice acting and the few characters that are in it. Everything else was a mess that was filled with poor directing.While I don’t think that Gundam Seed Destiny is the worst Gundam series thanks to the existence of ZZ Gundam and Build Divers it’s still a pretty terrible Gundam show you should avoid unless you are a fan of the original Gundam Seed.Final Score 3/10 squeal called Gundam Seed Destiny. Now unlike the original series many people especially hardcore Gundam fans seemed to have a polarizing reaction of Seed Destiny where it’s very diverse. Camp A is the people who loved it consider it to be one of the greatest Gundam shows ever made while Camp B are the people who despise it with a burning passion. What camp am I in? Well after watching Seed Destiny twice I can say that I am camp c the people who were fine with it however despite my being in Camp C I still don’t Seed Destiny to be a good whatsoever, however, I don’t think is as bad something like ZZ Gundam and Gundam Build Divers.Story.It is the year Cosmic Era 7.3 the leader of orb Cagalli arrives at armoury one to discuss the construction of new mobile weapons with the chairman of the plants Gilbert Durandal.

Yet I think it did very well in making an exciting extension story and the characters\' interactions make the series very interesting.It again tackles the issue of war-its effects and its very existence. And the strong dialogue make way for philosophical clashes and the continuous conflict of duty and humanity. The characters were pretty much torn in between many things, so not only the action and battles make way for suspense but definitely the drama too. Most of the time, mecha actions are enjoyable and excellent.It has many positive attributes but its flaws outweighs its goodness or vice versa. In short, many fans found it disappointing: The story was strong at first, but it was degraded by incoherence and drag- the weak characters greatly contribute (will be explained later).The story that was supposed to be two sides with good ideals fighting for a good cause amid some really evil guys turned out to be a ""fan war"" where the more loved characters are the ones glorified. The sides were once equal and then suddenly the loved ones are made goody-goody while the other is being made ""evil."" Then the worst part is the dragging anti-climatic lines (or endless flashbacks) of characters where they justify why they fight and why they oppose the other. Its purpose is to explain what they think- but as a critic, too much destroys the character of the show itself, add hypocrisy and were just made to really emphasize the supposed to be ""good guys"" of the show.Art (9/10)Surely the animation of this sequel is impressive especially to the fans of Seed. It has higher quality and more consistency. It did not fail in imaging a lot of memorable and dramatic scenes..The machines here are so much cooler and it has less reused action scenes. Still, like Seed, there are times where characters look like each other.Sound (10/10)GSD\'s sounds are in my top list; for me, its music is one of the best in anime, almost seemingly comparable to Cowboy Bebop in terms non repetitiveness. The sounds are so mecha and transports you to a different dimension while in dramatic scenes the music creates the perfect mood. All its opening and ending songs suit the series at all aspects. Also, it variates its songs and image music so well that the melody stays in your head though it creates different moods. Most of my favorite soundtracks came from this anime.Character (6/10)For me GSD is one of the series that disappoints a lot of viewers. It failed to portray its philosophical themes because of its weakness in its characters.The character of the show itself (as explained earlier) becomes weaker after the middle- it is degraded by fan service and ""god-wisdom"" lines. It has the most unnecessary flashbacks I have seen in my anime watching life,flashback episodes, flashbacks from Seed and itself. Because of that, it looks so ""trying hard"" to be deep and psychological.The NEW characters are clearly introduced at the beginning and the viewers expect their development and role. But GSD failed miserably at this: the main character lacks strength and growth which is very necessary for a drama plot. Most of the secondary characters don\'t pretty much add up to the overall drama and many find them insignificant. Of course, there are very interesting and lovable characters (like Stellar and Dullindal) and it seems that they were the ones that are saving GSD from doom.I must also note that the connection of the main protagonist, Shinn, and Stellar is probably the best asset of the series and is a very good psychological drama story.The RETURNING characters are pretty much developed already but their conflict with the new ones is interesting. They are supposed to be only part of history, but the writers made them the makers of history because of their popularity. Many fans will expect to see their loved characteristics again but GSD failed those fans by either adding angst or perfecting them to the point that they are annoyingly unrealistic. And lastly, if the viewers are not familiar with them they will ask : When did they become the main characters?Moreover, new mobile suits just sprout out of nowhere just to create a ""cooler model""Enjoyment (7/10)For Seed fans it is quite enjoyable but disappointing.This sequel was made to make the audience anticipate the appearance of the Seed characters and how they will affect the new characters\' lives, and it did succeed it a way. It may quench the thirst of hungry Gundam Seed enthusiasts but may make them hate the sequel for tampering with their favorite characters happy lives.Originality is also an issue, for by reading about Zeta Gundam I was disappointed by the ""copying and making it a lot better.""Personally I really love Stellar and I just can\'t forget her and this series is a little bit more romantic and political than Seed.OVERALL: 7 part of the story?What will be the new conflict since much of it was resolved already?There are many questions that was left from the prequel and many more arises from GSD. Yet I think it did very well in making an exciting extension story and the characters\' interactions make the series very interesting.It again tackles the issue of war-its effects and its very existence. And the strong dialogue make way for philosophical clashes and the continuous conflict of duty and humanity. The characters were pretty much torn in between many things, so not only the action and battles make way for suspense but definitely the drama too. Most of the time, mecha actions are enjoyable and excellent.It has many positive attributes but its flaws outweighs its goodness or vice versa. In short, many fans found it disappointing: The story was strong at first, but it was degraded by incoherence and drag- the weak characters greatly contribute (will be explained later).The story that was supposed to be two sides with good ideals fighting for a good cause amid some really evil guys turned out to be a ""fan war"" where the more loved characters are the ones glorified. The sides were once equal and then suddenly the loved ones are made goody-goody while the other is being made ""evil."" Then the worst part is the dragging anti-climatic lines (or endless flashbacks) of characters where they justify why they fight and why they oppose the other. Its purpose is to explain what they think- but as a critic, too much destroys the character of the show itself, add hypocrisy and were just made to really emphasize the supposed to be ""good guys"" of the show.Art (9/10)Surely the animation of this sequel is impressive especially to the fans of Seed. It has higher quality and more consistency. It did not fail in imaging a lot of memorable and dramatic scenes..The machines here are so much cooler and it has less reused action scenes. Still, like Seed, there are times where characters look like each other.Sound (10/10)GSD\'s sounds are in my top list; for me, its music is one of the best in anime, almost seemingly comparable to Cowboy Bebop in terms non repetitiveness. The sounds are so mecha and transports you to a different dimension while in dramatic scenes the music creates the perfect mood. All its opening and ending songs suit the series at all aspects. Also, it variates its songs and image music so well that the melody stays in your head though it creates different moods. Most of my favorite soundtracks came from this anime.Character (6/10)For me GSD is one of the series that disappoints a lot of viewers. It failed to portray its philosophical themes because of its weakness in its characters.The character of the show itself (as explained earlier) becomes weaker after the middle- it is degraded by fan service and ""god-wisdom"" lines. It has the most unnecessary flashbacks I have seen in my anime watching life,flashback episodes, flashbacks from Seed and itself. Because of that, it looks so ""trying hard"" to be deep and psychological.The NEW characters are clearly introduced at the beginning and the viewers expect their development and role. But GSD failed miserably at this: the main character lacks strength and growth which is very necessary for a drama plot. Most of the secondary characters don\'t pretty much add up to the overall drama and many find them insignificant. Of course, there are very interesting and lovable characters (like Stellar and Dullindal) and it seems that they were the ones that are saving GSD from doom.I must also note that the connection of the main protagonist, Shinn, and Stellar is probably the best asset of the series and is a very good psychological drama story.The RETURNING characters are pretty much developed already but their conflict with the new ones is interesting. They are supposed to be only part of history, but the writers made them the makers of history because of their popularity. Many fans will expect to see their loved characteristics again but GSD failed those fans by either adding angst or perfecting them to the point that they are annoyingly unrealistic. And lastly, if the viewers are not familiar with them they will ask : When did they become the main characters?Moreover, new mobile suits just sprout out of nowhere just to create a ""cooler model""Enjoyment (7/10)For Seed fans it is quite enjoyable but disappointing.This sequel was made to make the audience anticipate the appearance of the Seed characters and how they will affect the new characters\' lives, and it did succeed it a way. It may quench the thirst of hungry Gundam Seed enthusiasts but may make them hate the sequel for tampering with their favorite characters happy lives.Originality is also an issue, for by reading about Zeta Gundam I was disappointed by the ""copying and making it a lot better.""Personally I really love Stellar and I just can\'t forget her and this series is a little bit more romantic and political than Seed.OVERALL: 7', ""Gundam Seed Destiny is sequel to highly popular Gundam Seed and takes place in same universe.Story:GSD story is basically same as its older brother. Again Cordinators and Naturals have war though the reasons are little different from Seed. Story was almost direct copy from Seed and it takes my points down, although I still liked it because CE universe has so good athmospehere and lot of potential. If you are not fan of Seed story you probably don't like Destiny story either. On the positive note in my opinion Destiny had better pacing than Seed. Not so slow start. Although this may be influenced...trough that I watched this straight after seed so I was settled with universe and with most of the characters.Art:Art is truly phenomional. Gundams looked again cool like in Seed and everything was well animated. No complainsSound:This is easily best part in this series. Best anime OST ever in my opinion. All opening and ending songs were really well fitted in the series and insert music was really amazing. I almost recommend to watch this series for its music even if you don't like any other thing  in the series.Characters:I had really mixed feelings about this series characters. I of course liked all old characters and even some new ones were great (like dullindal and meer) but then again I almost hated some like Shinn and Stellar. Altough because I hated shinn I wanted to see him ketting his ass kicked so it was in a way good for the series. Still I will give this one point lower than seed because most of the new characters were shallow and couple of them were annoying.Enjoyment:In spite of all negative sides in this series compared to Seed I still enjoyed this series a lot. It had very good action scenes and even some likable drama. First half of the series was again worse than later one like in seed but especially the last 10 episodes were great again. I would have complained about the ending but luckily Final plus ova gave me better ending.Overall:Even though this series didn't rose at the same level as Seed I still liked it a lot and now I am hoping that they some time in distant future will make that movie. =D (probably won't =( ) trough that I watched this straight after seed so I was settled with universe and with most of the characters.Art:Art is truly phenomional.

However, there does exist a handful of people who think it\'s a very under-rated anime... and it just so happens that I\'m one of them. In fact, I\'m actually ASTOUNDED by how under-rated this show is, so here\'s my long winded take on ""Why Gundam Seed Destiny Is At Least As Good As Gundam Seed"", in which I shall attempt to bore anyone with opposing views into submission with the sheer weight of my wall of text :DI can think of several reasons...why this sequel proved to be so unpopular. One of the main ones is that, despite the superficial similarities, ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" is very much a different kettle of fish to its predecessor. A lot of people who enjoyed the action packed, exhilarating nature of ""Gundam Seed"" no doubt came away from this more subtle, politics heavy sequel disappointed that they didn\'t get more of the same. A friend of mine made the statement that if you take the ""Gundam"" out of title ""Gundam Seed Destiny"", it\'d probably suddenly become a lot more well received, and I\'m inclined to agree with that. One of the primary things you\'d look out for in a Gundam series (and this is something ""Gundam Seed"" does very well) - explosive mecha battles - are done rather shoddily in ""Gundam Seed Destiny"". The action leaves a lot to be desired - it\'s mostly a rehash of what we\'ve already seen a million times already in the 50 episodes of ""Gundam Seed"", except not as good; nearly every battle boringly ends with someone going berserk and annihilating everyone else on the battlefield, and there\'s a shocking amount of reused animation, as though it\'s made on about a quarter of the budget of ""Gundam Seed"", which would be very strange, considering the commercial success of that show. What all this amounts to is that, with a few notable exceptions, the battles in ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" are mostly snorefests.What ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" lacks in aesthetic values however, it makes up with something arguably more important - substance, because it\'s an anime that excels in areas of story and character development. The story, it has to be said, does not get off to a great start, with the whole copy cat Gundam stealing plot opening feeling a bit too similar to what happened in ""Gundam Seed"" (as well as about 1321 other Gundam stories) for comfort. Perhaps it\'s trying to convey some kind of ""history is repeating itself"" message, but the whole thing feels stale rather than thought provoking. Once the first few episodes are done, the series really starts to shine as the plot thickens and the strands of political intrigue are slowly woven together.In comparison to its predecessor, there is a significant shift in the focus of the story here. People who are expecting the story to continue to feature heavily on Kira and Athrun will be disappointed (and no doubt many of them were, as Kira is reduced to almost cameo appearances). The focus of this sequel is spread across quite several different characters, with none of them getting enough screen time to be justifiable labelled as *the* main character. The one that comes closest would probably be Shinn, and Shinn is one heck of a big talking point of ""Gundam Seed Destiny"", as he is both one of the most popular reasons for hating this series, and, in my opinion, by far the best character in both series combined (a claim that\'s probably nearly as controversial as the claim that ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" is at least as good as ""Gundam Seed"").The reason Shinn is so unpopular probably has something to do with the fact that he\'s a teeth grindingly annoying character. While many would argue that Kira is also annoying because he cried so much while in his role as a main character in ""Gundam Seed"", that\'s nothing compared to Shinn. Because, ultimately, Kira is still taken from the ""hero"" character mould, and mostly does a good job of following his moral compass. Shinn isn\'t like that. Shinn is a cocky, rebelling, misled brat. Like a similarly named character from ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", Shinn possesses a natural talent for pissing viewers off. However, unlike that other character, I don\'t find Shinn so extreme that I have difficulty understanding him. In fact, it\'s exactly because his personality and character progression are so effortlessly natural as well as interesting that I rate him as one of the finest anti-heros around. For instance, he does do a lot of angsty whining, but considering his personal loss, it\'d be quite odd if he\'s some happy-go-lucky chap instead. On top of all of that, he\'s a character with intense emotions, but he\'s no good at hiding them, and this gets played upon as he is caught up in all the intricate political power play. He has a lot of redeeming features, such as a strong sense of justice and a desire to use his power to protect the weak, but even these end up being used to manipulate him. This wouldn\'t be so bad if he wasn\'t so talented as a Gundam pilot, and it doesn\'t help that his cockiness goes off the charts as his skill increased, blinding him to reason. His relationship with Stella is particularly fascinating even though Stella herself is annoying and one dimensional, with the whole crappy love story smells suspiciously like a shoe-in that happened simply because cliche demanded it. What\'s interesting about this relationship is the effect of it on Shinn as he is driven to extremes, consumed by a burning desire to protect what he couldn\'t protect before. Throw this in along with his fiery temperament and misguided feelings of disillusionment and betrayal for someone he looks up to, and you end up with a very multi layered and explosive powder keg of a character, even if he is very dislikable. I\'ll admit that I don\'t like him either, but I do recognise that he\'s a a fantastic character as everything about him ""fits"" and makes perfect sense. And in fact his annoyingness does end up giving rise to some of the most exhilarating battles in ""Gundam Seed Destiny"", due to the fact that I just wanted someone to kick his ass so badly lol.In addition to the most central character being an anti-hero, ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" also has an anti-villain counter part. I like the fact that he has a lot of subtlety and charm. Though he may not quite be on the same level as the awesome villains from ""Berserk"" and ""Gankutsuoh"", he\'s at least cut from a similar cloth. When all is revealed, it can be argued that, rather than being evil, the ""villain"" has simply walked down the wrong path in his desires to achieve what he perceives to be the greater good. His frequent musings is very much at the heart of the main theme of ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" which, incidentally, suits its title much better than ""Gundam Seed"" - ""Gundam Seed"" barely devoting any time explaining the whole ""Seed"" thing whereas this sequel does a pretty serious exploration of its theme revolving around destiny, asking questions such as whether we would actually be better off with our life already laid out for us.A lot of characters from ""Gundam Seed"" makes a return in ""Gundam Seed Destiny"". Most of them have changed for the better. In particular, Athrun seems to have acquired quite a dignified aura. Kira\'s time on screen has been drastically cut down, but this has actually given him an enigmatic air, like he\'s some kind of masked crusader for justice, which definitely makes him more interesting as far as I\'m concerned. Both Athrun and Kira have a greater feeling of maturity about them, which makes sense considering all they had to go through.I do have some complaints about the characters though. There are some parts about the characters\' progression didn\'t make sense. For example, Rey\'s change at the end of the show feels totally out of the blue. I don\'t see how he can deviate from something he\'s committed to for so long just because someone said a few words to him (words that I even didn\'t feel was that persuasive or stirring to begin with). Also, I don\'t really like those youth pilots like Stella who were pumped full of drugs. I think I\'m supposed to feel sympathy for them, but I found them irritating instead as the anime tried too hard to make them ""edgy"" for the sake of melodrama. Speaking of melodrama, it\'s actually pretty well done in ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" for the most part. I remember a scene between Stella and Shinn that was particularly memorable. Admittedly, it was a blatent rip off of one of the best cut scenes in ""Final Fantasy VII"", but since it\'s a very worked rip off, I didn\'t mind.Despite me rating ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" very highly, I must admit that I found watching it somewhat hard going towards the end. It was probably a mistake to watch it so soon after ""Gundam Seed"". With the two series both suffering from the franchise\'s obsession with making TV series that are about 50 episodes long, watching them back to back not surprisingly caused a bit of a burn out in me. The original series already felt a bit dragged out, and the feeling is even more prevalent here. Maybe it simply feels this way because this series is built on an already overstretched first series, but honestly, does it really take a whooping 100 episodes to tell this story?!There are other things that ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" inherited from ""Gundam Seed"" and the Gundam franchise in general that contributed to my fatigue with watching it. Most of these elements are either stuff that are inherited badly, or stuff that I wasn\'t keen on to begin with. Aside from the action which I already mentioned, there are the distinctive character designs (which I never particularly liked); the miraculous ability of some characters to survive through seemingly impossible situations (with no follow up explanation as to HOW they managed it); and the obligatory man in mask cliche etc. There\'s even an attempt to re-create something comparable to the enchanting eye-catch from ""Gundam Seed""... an attempt that failed as it came off looking like some cheesey ad for a Barbie & Ken doll set instead. Thankfully, one thing that ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" has inherited that\'s actually good is the epic music. It is every bit as good as the music from ""Gundam Seed"", and the huge OST that spans across quite a few CD\'s is still one of my favourites to date.So there you have it, whether you\'ll enjoy ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" will depend heavily on how open you are to the changes found in this rather unorthodox Gundam series. For those who don\'t crave the polished action found in ""Gundam Seed"" and who enjoy some subtle politics and solid character development, you might just find ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" to be a shining gem beneath all its surface roughness. why this sequel proved to be so unpopular. One of the main ones is that, despite the superficial similarities, ""Gundam Seed Destiny"" is very much a different kettle of fish to its predecessor.

In it we meet again, so beloved by us earlier, but have grown up characters, and new.Characters, and mecha are the same as we left them in the first season. But as time passed. Our friends have matured. Although, not all, as turned out to be something taken out of the lesson of their former errors. Every word, every action — before the eyes of that same Gundam, just changed the appearance of new characters and the idea that I was sick Chairman. We see events through the eyes of others, on the other...side. And now, with the fall of fragments of the colony Junius 7 on Earth begins a new battle for the characters, a new war. Some may sigh, but provide no Gundam battles impossible. It is impossible not to fight, while living in the world, and especially in war. And returning to the roots of one is not encouraging. Again, continuing the battle will resume again the policy will spit on people, rivers stained red, and the music will be muted groans of the dying and losing everything in the fire of the most expensive. Again, seeing no one wants suffering. And who prefer something like that?Only those who profit from this, who makes a name for himself. They talk about a world without a warrior for justice, for some incredible plans sverhideyah, projects that can idealize the human race, the future — to write on a blank sheet of destiny. And these people believe. They want to believe. For us, the audience, the idea of   the plan the Chairman «Destiny» just another idea to enslave the entire world. So those who would believe it, who? Fools? There world is filled with billions of fools? No, I guess. We were not in a situation like they are even. We were not in place of those desperate people that are not able to fight for the salvation of the words which the Chairman and Lacus Clyne, that the image, clean and beautiful. People do not live in order to fight and cry. As Kagalli said, «Life — is not just a battle». But we have to fight. Fight to one day all can live happily ever after. We must fight for their future, their future, being able to endure all the hardships and difficulties. And it is easy to do if you are not alone. When you're surrounded by friends when you are hoping hundreds of people, when someone sacrifices their lives for, even if it sounds pathetic, but the future, how can you try to escape from the battle, how hard is not it? So, for example, Athrun again lost. Not wanting to continue the war and fleeing from the past, he disappeared into the Orbe. And then he just felt useless, unable to do anything. He returned to the same doubts that plagued him in the first season.In Athrun have the power, wisdom, understanding, but he again began to look for an answer, for what need to fight, for whom and why. One of the characters Gundam SEED Destiny said: «Why are we fighting for?.. When we start to think about it — it will mean that we lost». Athrun lost himself, his past.Everyone knows that at any moment death can resume. Nobody wants that. To live, expecting at any moment from heaven may fall upon the stones — it is almost impossible. I do not want to fight, you do not want to be afraid. I want peace, but what is it? Kira, Lacus, Kagalli, Athrun — they are too experienced to treat all without trepidation, fear, despair, and not wanting to admit a single mistake. Suddenly it will become a cause for a new battle. Kagalli was ready to sacrifice everything for his country. Kira wanted a world without war, where no one will have to endure what he endured, and many other participants in the battles. For this he was ready to fight for the sake of those who are dear to him... A Athrun... After escaping from the past, he was lost in the present with no hope for the future. The feeling of helplessness weighed on him, and Chairman the words were so believable...But, of course, the entire generation of past battles would like to be deceived by stories of a world without wars. Particularly susceptible to this, those who saw the horror of battle with my own eyes and in that moment he could not do anything. Having lost everything, how terrible the idea that no matter what you do not pass, that the world is too cruel, and all around are wrong. Only you, as it were, seen it, only you lost and wept over the dead bodies of his parents and little sister. And such a person continues to confirm the validity of Chairman and cheering words, even without knowing its purpose and thus they mock and insult people whose ideals are somehow different from their own. And that Shinn — the protagonist Gundam SEED Destiny.... side. And now, with the fall of fragments of the colony Junius 7 on Earth begins a new battle for the characters, a new war. Some may sigh, but provide no Gundam battles impossible. It is impossible not to fight, while living in the world, and especially in war. And returning to the roots of one is not encouraging.

One of the characters Gundam SEED Destiny said: «Why are we fighting for?.. When we start to think about it — it will mean that we lost». Athrun lost himself, his past.Everyone knows that at any moment death can resume. Nobody wants that. To live, expecting at any moment from heaven may fall upon the stones — it is almost impossible. I do not want to fight, you do not want to be afraid. I want peace, but what is it? Kira, Lacus, Kagalli, Athrun — they are too experienced to treat all without trepidation, fear, despair, and not wanting to admit a single mistake. Suddenly it will become a cause for a new battle. Kagalli was ready to sacrifice everything for his country. Kira wanted a world without war, where no one will have to endure what he endured, and many other participants in the battles. For this he was ready to fight for the sake of those who are dear to him... A Athrun... After escaping from the past, he was lost in the present with no hope for the future. The feeling of helplessness weighed on him, and Chairman the words were so believable...But, of course, the entire generation of past battles would like to be deceived by stories of a world without wars. Particularly susceptible to this, those who saw the horror of battle with my own eyes and in that moment he could not do anything. Having lost everything, how terrible the idea that no matter what you do not pass, that the world is too cruel, and all around are wrong. Only you, as it were, seen it, only you lost and wept over the dead bodies of his parents and little sister. And such a person continues to confirm the validity of Chairman and cheering words, even without knowing its purpose and thus they mock and insult people whose ideals are somehow different from their own. And that Shinn — the protagonist Gundam SEED Destiny...."", ""GSD tells us a humanistic truth that one's fate is not predetermined but rather, it's in the individual to create his future.directed by mitsuo fukuda, GSD is the sequel to GS. With a sequel comes new characters and new mobile suits balancing mecha action with the plot development.character artwork was above average to good at some point, you can easily spot differences when the characters turn at some angles although this is only a minor. mobile suits can be commended for those intricate parts and structures. the only majow flaw one can easily comment was the repetitive mobile suit action scene you see from one...episode to another.GSD is a fine addition to the ever-growing and popular gundam saga. i must say that my heart really aches to see the drama and despair that war brings to the lives of every individual, despite being fictional, especially to the characters. this series greatly conveys that there are no wins in a war but a lot of loses and a hope for a peaceful future.. episode to another.GSD is a fine addition to the ever-growing and popular gundam saga. i must say that my heart really aches to see the drama and despair that war brings to the lives of every individual, despite being fictional, especially to the characters. this series greatly conveys that there are no wins in a war but a lot of loses and a hope for a peaceful future.."", ""As the name suggests, Gundam Seed Destiny is a sequel to the popular Gundam Seed. Now Gundam Seed was the first Gundam series that I ever watched, so I was happy to find out that there was a sequel for it. Sadly, the sequel disappoints greatly with regards to the plot and characters.Story: 4The plot revolves an anti-coordinator group known as the Blue Cosmos/ Logos (Think KKK) that happen to be in charge of the Earth Alliance forces (Who thought that would be a good idea?). Due to a series of incidents that were caused by this group, the Earth Alliance ends up going to...war with Zaft. At this point it's difficult to separate Seed and Destiny anymore since almost everything has been rehashed; Earth and Zaft go to war over certain incidents, there are 3 druggies who end up being competent pilots, the Minerva looks almost like a clone of the Archangel, Strike has been given a face lift and given a new name, a destructive weapon capable of destroying part of Earth and  hell even the captains of the ships look alike.Now I wouldn't mind them taking out the parts that made Seed good, but blatantly copying everything is just stupid and unenjoyable.Art: 5The amount of stock footage used is staggering. Granted, this was also a problem with Seed but in almost every fight, stock footage is reused at least twice. Apart from that, the animations are not particularly eye catching but they serve their purpose.Sound: 8Seed had really good music, and Destiny didn't disappoint on this. In fact, I found myself enjoying certain songs from Destiny more than Seed.Characters: 3Here is the crux of the problem. In Seed we had the POV of students thrust into a war and them learning to adapt and deal with the horrors of war. In Destiny however, almost all the main characters seem to be John Does.Shinn - Shinn's back story is a typical sobstory that makes zero sense when we stop to actually think about it. He's angry at a country for the death of his family because they were too stupid to evacuate early and were running into a battlefield? There are limits to how stupid a character's backstory is. Also, there seems to be zero development for him. He still acts as an annoying prick throughout the entire series.Kira - Kira was an interesting and realistic character in Seed who had to deal with multiple issues such as the loss of Fray(sp?) and Todd, going against his ideals to fight and fighting against his best friend. In Destiny he is frequently referred to by viewers as Jesus Yamato because he acts exactly like how Jesus would. He is always taking the moral high ground (No killing, stop fighting) and has zero variation at all.Athrun - Out of all the MCs, Athrun was the most realistic one to watch. His conflicting emotions from Seed carried over to Destiny as he has had to make choices between his allegiance to his homeland or to his friends. His relationship with Cagalli was just annoying to watch because it could have been solved if only they had communicated.Overall: 5Perhaps Destiny was spoiled because of my expectations, but as a sequel Destiny falls flat. If it was a stand alone perhaps the characters could be excused for what they were, but taking what made those characters interesting in Seed and twisting it around to make them extremely boring John Does mean that it just isn't a worthy sequel to Seed. war with Zaft.

These had the best story telling, along with characters and mecha that showed that you didn\'t need all the huge explosions just for a grand stand to be epic. Also for the record I have a burning hatred for this particular series and this may contain spoilers that I can\'t review this without saying so please bear with me.Story:If you have watched Gundam SEED you should already know the back story for this, seeing as it\'s a direct sequel to Gundam...SEED. and at the beginning it actually is watchable. The main character at first looks to be the old anti-hero of Gundam SEED, Athrun Zala, But he then is proven to be there for nostalgia\'s sake making way for the new guy piloting the new Gundam, Shinn Asuka. Now this shows great story and me and all the people I watch this with agree that this is the high point of the series. But the story comes crashing down when all of a sudden Shinn loses his spot light to, as my friends refer to him, ""Jesus"" Yamato, or Kira ""McBeamSpam."" Yes the hero of Gudam SEED, halfway through the anime mind you, shoves the main character out of his role and stands there looking like he was just. ARGH!!! This is why Zeta and ZZ are the best sequels ever, because they switch the main character from the previous series for a new person, who in all rights is his own form of epicness. So yeah, back to the story, it\'s a complete train wreck after meeting back up with Kira with a stupid ending. I seriously had to finish the series on a dare and i ended up beating my head against a wall.Art:All things aside the designs are great. The Gundams themselves are nice to look at and fight the way they do in SEED. The characters have the Infinite Ryvius/S-cry-ed look which they were doing at the time. I personally think this style works for some animes but ruins it for others. It work for this one I guess seeing as all the bad parts of the anime are in the story an no character development.Sound:I can\'t remember the sound that well but it couldn\'t have been that bad. That is literally all i can think to put hear.Character:We finally hit this point. My biggest rant in this whole review next to the story or the enjoyment (probably). For all it\'s faults I have only one character I like, Shinn. He was a great character. He was the closest character in this to not being an Infinite Ryvius clone. He wasn\'t looking for the approval of anyone. He broke orders and had no tie-downs like parents or family. The only people close to him are either mecha pilots, or the crew of the battleship. Then we go to Kira, Mr. Needs-All-The-Spotlight-Of-Everything-He\'s-In. I\'ve hated him with a passion. He tries to use the Amuro Ray reason for fighting like protecting his friends. His only real difference from Amuro is that he has a girlfriend in the end, also that he never dies. Also, Newtypes are better than Coordinator. Coordinators are basically Cyber Newtypes but are treated as Newtypes. That is my last line because if i go on anymore this will go into a rant about 00 season 2 and I said this would be one on SEED Destiny.Enjoyment:Watch this anime through once. Then see if you\'ll enjoy it. Most people who enjoy this anime have never seen the original Gundams and have nothing to compare this to. Most, if not all, who hate this anime have seen at least all the 80\'s Gundams and know that this was a mediocre work at best trying to be a Gundam. This brought with it no new sayings or feelings beside rage and this sucks to the hardcore Gundam fans.Overall:I hat this anime, but it is something you have to decide. P.S. don\'t spam me with s**** about how this was a great anime. I own a Katana and know how to use it. Trust me I can lose my patience with people very quickly.

To speak of it simply this is a show you would buy on DVD just so you can have the pleasure of stomping it into a million pieces then watch it burn in a fire.there is nothing to speak of in terms of characters and story. Going straight into one of the worst things they could have done to Gundam as a franchise are the flashy war machines which seem to work on magic and pixy dust. In any of the older gundams everything felt...mechanical and at some points in the show they show the inner workings. (the 8th MS team being a good example for when Shiro was doing a field repair on his RX-79\'s feet)Gundams are not meant to fly, the UC universe addresses this with suits that transform into planes and flying platforms purpose built to act as a carrier. In Wing they have...well massive wings and a ridiculous amount of thruster nozzles mounted on the flying suits. They also address the power issue by making each mobile suit carry it\'s own nuclear reactor. This is not the case here.Now uber pwnage machines are not an issue with me, the only problem is how much. In any other mecha show and the rest of the gundam series, a super powerful machine has draw backs and are usually very difficult to operate. in some cases they are downright unreliable. In many cases as well the ""prototype"" uber special unit which our main character has is quickly dwarfed by something the antagonists build to counter it. When we see the gundams in Seed Destiny it\'s simply unfair to everyone else in the world, the disparity in power is simply too great and the main characters as a result never seem to be in any real danger which would motivate them to act as they do. If we were to throw Shiro Amada, and Kamil into a MS fighting ring against Kira and Athrun sporting the same standardized suits it is fairly obvious which side would win. While team 1 would quickly decide on a course of action and act upon it, team 2 would spend several episodes whining about how they don\'t want to be involved in this conflict. Once they get their faces pounded in and they are at the end of their rope, team 2 will enter ""seed mode"" in desperation for their survival and the well being of their bestest friends. However at this point since they are all using the same suits, would not be able to perform any miracle maneuvers and lose.character development is very little if at all. The sound track is ok and the op and ed music is pretty good. The animation is limited and weak but that can be said for most shows of it\'s time. the art is decent however i do not enjoy the pretty boy with long thin arms and legs styles much in any series. The action sequences were cool for a while, but then it seems like the same moves are recycled over and over where a character charges into the fray, locks onto a gazillion targets really quickly while  glancing across their display screen, and subsequently blowing up everything he just locked on to.a terrible terrible show you should simply not watch if you have any form of respect for mecha anime of any kind. Go watch any other gundam, hell go watch Macross thats actually good if you can get over the idea of music solving galactic problems. mechanical and at some points in the show they show the inner workings.

The toys are usually the main money-making machine.  But the (animated) stories behind it are usually what sends said franchise to either ""legendary status"" or it\'s own funeral.Seed Destiny, which is more like a badly-written repeat to Seed than a sequel, nearly BURIED it for Bancolding$ (Bandai Namco Holdings / $unrise) in terms of anything Gundam.

Expect most of the characters from the 1st season to be included with some new addition. Seed Destiny introduces a new protagonist to the story named Shin. Of course Kira and Athrun still plays a major role to the story. But in comparison to the 1st season, the story became a little bit of dull on the 2nd season. The story is straight forward and the plot is something you would expect. It feels like the Seed Destiny was forced to be made just to please...the fans. However, I do like how the characters developed. There are some changes made in regards to the love interests and the relationship between characters. I pay less attention to this kind of stuff. But I a lot of people are affected by this.What I like best about the Seed Destiny are the battle scenes and the new gundams. Each fight is full of intensity and excitement. It takes the gundam fight to a whole new level. There are a lot of new cool gundams such as the Akatsuki, Destiny, Legend, Infinite Justice, and a lot more. But my favorite gundam of all time is the Strike Freedom. My favorite part of the show is where the Strike Freedom made it's first appearance and wiped out an army of mobile suits in just a few seconds. It's a lot more powerful than the Freedom. Everything has been fully upgraded, from the mobility up to the weapon system. I consider the Strike Freedom as the most powerful gundam in history. As for the other gundam, you have to see for yourself on what their capable of. Aside from the battle scenes and gundams, another great thing about the 2nd season is the music. The background music and sound effects on each scene fits perfectly, especially during dramatic moments. The opening and ending songs are good. But not as good as the songs from the 1st season. These are just some of the good qualities on what the Seed Destiny has to offer.Overall, I like the Gundam Seed Destiny. It's one of the best gundam series I've ever watched. I admit it's not that perfect. Like any other series, the Seed Destiny has it's own strong and weak points. The story isn't great compared to the first season. But the fight scenes are definitely one of the greatest. I love all of the gundams and I've grown attached to the characters. That is why I was so affected on how things turn out for each character. Having a 2nd season is really worth it, since the Seed Destiny ends the series with a grand finale. If you haven't watch Gundam Seed Destiny, then I highly recommend you try it out. As a gundam fan, I gurantee you'll love it. It's one of those series that you don't want to miss. This concludes my anime review on Gundam Seed Destiny.

You get Gundam Seed Destiny my friends.While Gundam Seed is not that great of a show, it's sequel Seed Destiny is just as bad if not worse for three main reason, character focus, plot focus, and character development.Character focus - The first main problem with Seed Destiny is the character focus.  The series can not determine who it should focus on more Shinn, or Athrun and Kira.  To give a prime example on how character...focus should be done, lets take a look at the series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.  In the show Char and Amuro from the original show appear however they appear in more mentor roles for Kamille instead of trying to hog all the spot light, not to say that there were times that the show focused more on them.  However this was kept to smaller amounts of time.  This show however can't make up it's mind on who they should focus on more.  While yes it is good to see Athrun and Kira again, we don't need to spend episode after episode of them doing their own thing or having the sole focus on them.Plot focus- Another major problem is plot focus.  One of the major problems with Seed was it's dependency on flashbacks and clip shows.  Sadly this does not get fixed, but gets worse with Destiny.  While flashbacks can be helpful for shows, every episode does not need a flashback, nor does a series need to see clip shows all the time.  If Destiny would have focused more on the plot and less on flashbacks the plot would have been more consistent and would have been better.Character development - The last major problem with Destiny is the character development.  While some characters do get development in this series, it becomes few and far between overall.  Most of the characters stay the same from the first time you meet them, or have some changes but overall don't change a lot.Overall Destiny feels like a lot of wasted potential.  The show had the ability to be a great sequel to Seed, but instead wasted it on flashbacks, and inconsistent character focus. focus should be done, lets take a look at the series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.

I find both series very different, which also makes Destiny a success. If both were similar, it's really hard to expand. People who are expecting a same kind of genre/presentation from Seed will probably be disappointed, or at least shocked.Story (8/10):The way the story is presented was really mind-boggling. For the moment, you think things are this way, the next moment you are confused whether is it really the way it looks. I liked also how the dialogues and philosophical issues really make you think and reflect,...without being too morbid/psychotic. It was so exciting that I was literally watching more and more episodes. I think this may be the fastest I've ever watched an anime.Art (6/10):The art style is the same as Seed's. I like Seed's artwork, so I'll explain why I gave destiny a 6/10. Destiny had a whole new range of new characters, not to mention the old characters, and because of that I think some of the characters were poorly designed, or even look re-used. The mobile suits were also hardly distinct, and did not leave as much of an impression as Seed's mecha. Inspite of that, there were a few good character/gundam designs. I especially liked the Hawke sisters.Sound (8/10)The BGM blended pretty subtly with the series, which was nice. The OP/ED of Destiny was really good in my opinion. The way they integrate the ED with the last few seconds of the anime really set the mood to make you want to watch another episode. The See-Saw endings were the best and most appropriate for the entire series. And changing the OP/ED every 12-14 episodes retained the freshness of the songs.Character (9/10)The strongest point of Destiny. My favourite part of the series were the episodes when the characters had a destined/special encounter with each other face to face (not robot to robot). I think these special conversations make a huge difference in the whole show (to me at least) and makes it more interesting. There were a few characters that really touched me as a viewer, and I thought it they were very adorable. Generally, the new cast were good, and the developments of the old cast were improved too.Enjoyment (8/10)I thoroughly enjoyed Destiny. It's definitely the better series I've watched in a while. For those who want maximum enjoyment, instead of watching episode 50 (last episode), watch the OVA Final Plus instead. It's essentially a revamped last episode that has a much better ending.Overall (8/10)I gave Destiny an 8 because 8 to me is really good. It's a quality series and a proper ending to the entire series. without being too morbid/psychotic. It was so exciting that I was literally watching more and more episodes.

Its the same as Code Geass and Bleeach if they had a baby, only not as good! I am not sure where they hid the instruction manual for this thing. Let me tell you about this confused show!First off its just like Code Geass because it starts off as if theres some back story your supposed to know! There were characters and events everywhere I didn't understand, but basically it's the story of revenge from a kid who's mad at other kids for killing his family in a...war. It's not much special and you know the villain from the start, even though they flash back to stuff I never seen and other parts over and over again. How did these people even get these robots? They just want to sell Happy Meal action figures!Art is pretty crap, I'm sorry but Im true. All characters have the same face all the time and its way too colors. Compare it to Bleach's interesting art derection and you have nothing. It may be better than Code Geass, though, because some characters look like they eat meals.The music in this show is great and openings are fantastic. Its on scale with great live action epic shows like Star Wars and The Lord in The Rings as well as Chicken Run. I am kidding, but the first two.The characters are just terrible and often reference things I never understood or saw. Some characters are in love even though they're enemies or clones! Then they pretend like they died or something! I don't get it, nobody does!Over all, I can't recommend this series to anyone because nobody will know what's going on like me. Stick with Bleach, or if you want something just as stupid but better, look on Code Geass. Thank you! war.

Thank you!"", 'Pissing in the windFirst off: SPOILERSGundam SEED was a bit of a big deal when it first aired. Ratings were high and model kits were flying off shelves. While I’m not the biggest fan of SEED, I’ll even say that it’s pretty one note and annoying at times, but I can appreciate what it did for the franchise and how it helped push Gundam back into the forefront after several years of lagging ratings and mixed critical reception. But we’re not here to talk about SEED. We’re here to talk about its sequel: SEED Destiny. Airing just 12 months after the original SEED finished...its run (which should be a pretty big indicator about how things were going to play out), Destiny did well ratings wise, though nowhere near as good as SEED. Bandai/Sunrise clearly thought they had to strike while the pan was still hot and rushed into production as fast as humanly possible and the result is 50 episodes of… well, you’ll see.Plot: Just like how SEED was a modernised update of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Destiny is a modernised version of Zeta Gundam. Kind of. I’d like to say that was the case but unfortunately Destiny is basically a repeat of SEED except now focusing on ZAFT on the outbreak of a new war. Young coordinator Shinn Asuka joins ZAFT after his sister and family were killed during the battle for ORB depicted in SEED and ends up thrown into the middle of the conflict, piloting the Impulse Gundam (and eventually the Destiny). Athrun ends up rejoining ZAFT because reasons while Kira, Lacus and the Archangel Crew watch from the sidelines and generally cause a nuisance. Destiny starts off fairly well in all honesty. It’s the anniversary of the Earth-PLANT war and ZAFT are flexing off their new Gundams that they will totally use for peace purposes. A couple of Alliance druggies rock up and steal them, a colony gets dropped on earth and everything goes to shit. A bunch of fights and melodrama happens and then eventually things come to a head with another big battle in space featuring a colony laser about to blow up Earth and a big clash between all the Gundams. If you’ve seen SEED, you know the drill. In fact the ending climax is identical to that show, even featuring recycled footage from SEED, which really just makes the whole thing feel painfully ironic. While the show has a decent start (shoddy character development not withstanding), things take a sudden and sharp decline right about the time where Shinn manages to shoot down the Freedom. At this point the show descends into complete mindnumbing insanity as Kira returns to take over the role of MC. There’s a shopping trip at one point, another godforsaken clip show, two entire episodes focused on a pointless side character and then a big horrible climax that just might be the single worst ending to a Gundam series ever. But we’ll get to that. Overall, Destiny has a decent plot for the first 36 or so episodes. It reuses a lot of plot beats from SEED but it’s still an intriguing watch. Then around episode 39 it combusts on itself and becomes borderline unwatchable.First half: B-Last 11 episodes: FCharacters: Ho boy…SEED established a rather interesting cast of characters. They were flawed people who despite their issues with themselves and each other, mostly strove to do the right thing (or at the very least what they thought was right). Some of them did come off as preachy and irritating, but given the situation they were in, it was really the best choice to go considering how comically evil the Alliance and ZAFT were. Destiny takes these character beats and either cranks them up to 11 or does a complete 180. The returning cast are barely recognisable from their original selves. Kira is now an almighty god who is never wrong, never fails and is always the voice of reason. His pacifism has mutated from being fairly justifiable and understandable to being absurdly over the top. Everyone must cease their fighting right this second or he’ll disable all their suits. The status Quo of uneasy peace must be upheld; regardless of the objective evilness of the Alliance (it’s odd that the Archangel crew view Chairman Durandal as a much more serious threat, compared to the literal super racist new world order that is manufacturing wars back on Earth. You’d think with the group’s extreme anti war sentiment, they would be the main target but they’re basically ignored completely as soon as Kira returns to the spotlight). Athrun repeats his entire character arc from SEED, that being a confused young man torn between his morals and his homeland. You’d think he’d sort his alliances out, especially considering that’s what he did in SEED, but he’s back to being an apprehensive and confused dope who doesn’t know what he’s fighting for. Lacus is as sickeningly perfect as ever, to the point at the finale she becomes the goddamned chairwoman of the PLANTS (and now she’s got a body double running around). And Cagalli, oh sweet sweet Cagalli, what have they done to you? Who was once an independent, smart and brash young woman who thinks for herself and doesn’t take anyone’s shit is reduced to a snivelling, meek little girl who serves purely as a political pawn and breaks down in tears whenever anything goes south. Her treatment was so bad that apparently her VA, Naomi Shindō, refused to return to the role for years. Mwu La Flaga; easily the best character in SEED next to the absolute madman Rau, is inexplicably back from the dead despite being visibly decapitated in SEED, now brainwashed by the Alliance and turned into a Char clone who commits a load of war crimes but comes back around again and is accepted with open arms by the Archangel Crew. Good fucking lord.Then there’s the new cast. In the role of “main character”, we have Shinn Asuka. He’s loud, he’s angry, he’s angsty, he’s a dickhead and I love him. Yeah, Shinn is really REALLY divisive in the fandom but in all honesty, his shitstirring nature and the fact he can, and will, tear into the hypocritical returning cast make him a total blast to watch. Shinn was, presumably, made to be the CE’s Kamille. An angry young man who comes around and learns the importance of protecting people while suffering through a terrible conflict. The show even starts off building up Shinn’s character to a rather cliche (by Gundam standards) but understandable point where he’ll shed his emotional baggage and see things clearly. That moment never comes. As Kira wrestles his way back into the spotlight, Shinn is cast as a villain in the show’s final act, continuing to be blinded by fury all the way up until the final episode where he’s soundly defeated by Athrun (who switched sides again) and ends up crying his eyes out on the moon next to his destroyed Gundam while the archangel crew finish the battle without taking a single scratch. Wonderful.Lunamaria Hawke serves as Shinn’s lady friend. She’s nice, cute and friendly though she hardly gets developed much, apart from egregious fanservice shots and the fact she can’t shoot for shit. There’s also Rey, another of Shinn’s pals who is so clearly evil that you can see the reveal from space. Surprise surprise, he’s a clone of Rau from SEED because they had to keep copying ideas from the predecessor. Other than that he’s pretty neat. Gilbert Durandal is the chairman for ZAFT, a charismatic and charming man who is honestly fairly level headed and reasonable throughout the series compared to the diabolically over the top evil of the Alliance, yet he’s made into a villain in the final act because he’s actually a super space dictator who wants to control all life in the universe and god knows, we need another colony laser finale. There’s also Stellar, Shinn’s other love interest and one of the Alliance druggies who steals the Gundams in the first few episodes. She’s this show’s Four Murasame, except with zero development outside of loving Shinn and being totally insane and her death only serves to push Shinn deeper into his fury spiral. The new cast are fine, I like them even, especially Shinn and Durandal.Ranking: B- for the New CastF for the OldAnimation: Since Destiny shared the same animation team as its predecessor, it looks the same as Seed, though it’s worth noting things stay consistently on model for most of the show (which is a massive surprise considering how hellish production was). This isn’t like Seed where Kira’s facial structure changes for 35 episodes and then shifts back again. Then again this may be a result of me watching the HD remaster but things still look fine. While I’m not a fan of the somewhat garish and overly colourful look of the show, it does give the series a distinctive look and that’s fine. Hisashi Hirai is back as character designer which means everyone has the same face but with different hair, but whatever. He has a recognisable style and you can absolutely tell its him whenever he does artwork. Overall it’s nice, not what I would choose but it’s fine.Ranking: B-Music: Toshihiko Sahashi returns on composing duties and does a fucking fantastic job as per usual. His compositions are bar none the best part of Destiny (and all of the CE now that I think about it). The opening themes are also, once again, amazing with T.M Revolution returning to provide the first opening, the extremely catchy and rocking ‘Ignited’. The HD remaster sadly replaces the final opening ‘Winds of Words’ by Chemistry with another tune by him ‘Vestige’, which is a massive shame considering its an utterly beautiful song, but people whined that it didn’t fit the tone so it got switched out, which sucks but whatever. It’s on streaming at least.AStructure: Destiny has some weird pacing and plot beats. The first batch of episodes with the colony hitting earth are fantastic and extremely entertaining to watch. The show then goes through a bit of a routine for the next 20 or so, mainly focusing on a series of increasingly large scale battles before it comes to a head with the Destroy Gundam arc, a very enjoyable watch which sees Shinn manage to take down the Freedom through sheer force of will, research and playing mind games on Kira. While the fight between the two is plagued with stock footage, it’s a legitimately fantastic and thrilling watch and definitely the absolute peak of the series, maybe even all of the CE. Then it all goes bad when Kira somehow survives a point blank nuclear explosion but whatever, I’m probably asking too much out of this mess to simply want a coherent plot.SEED’s main issue, the horrific overuse of stock footage and flashbacks, return full force and in fact its even worse, in fact it may be the absolute worst case in all of Gundam, rivalling Wing and SEED in the number of reused frames. I wouldn’t be exaggerating if I told you maybe 60% of Destiny was stock footage and flashbacks. Holy mother of God, the FLASHBACKS. THEY’RE EVERYWHERE. There’s flashbacks to scenes that happen earlier in the same episode! There’s entire episodes that consist of flashbacks within flashbacks. It’s like fucking Inception! Apparently the original TV version is even worse with like 10 clip shows or something ridiculous. We’ve already seen this shit a million times I KNOW SHINN IS TORN UP ABOUT HIS SISTER STOP SHOWING THE SAME FOOTAGE OF HER DEATH JESUS CHRIST.Rating: I don’t fucking know manFinal thoughts:Jesus let’s just get this over with. Destiny is a total mess. There’s parts I liked, parts that confused me and parts that absolutely pissed me the fuck off. I could forgive the ridiculous amount of stock footage and flashbacks, I could forgive the recycled plot beats from SEED, I could forgive all that, If they just told a good story. But they don’t. They spend 37 episodes building up a character who never properly completes his character arc. They spend longer utterly destroying the characters of SEED. They spend the entire godforsaken run throwing out every single shred of goodwill and hope SEED had built up and treating the audience like total morons. AGE may have be boring and NT may be totally fucking stupid but Destiny feels like an almost deliberate attempt of sabotage. And the worst part, the absolute worst part, is that its ultimately pointless. Everything basically returns to the exact same way it did at the end of SEED. This isn’t like Zeta where the events of the show massively shape how the next two decades of UC story play out, this is nothing. The status quo of uneasy peace is upheld. The archangel crew win, again. ZAFT and the Alliance are left crippled and with egg on their faces. There’s a movie coming out sometime in the next whenever, so maybe Destiny’s events will be built upon and expanded, but will they really? Can we trust Sunrise to not just redo the plot of SEED again except this time on the big screen? God help us all and remember, SHINN IS WIN.Pros: the fantastic music, Shinn, solid Gundam designs (except the Akatsuki, holy shit), decent action scenes, seeing Yzak and Dearka again is always a treat.Cons: atrocious character development, the slap in the face finale, extreme stock footage, reused plot beats, absurd plot twists, mind numbing dialogue (especially in the last stretch), a shocking amount of filler, useless characters (looking at you, Meer)Overall rating: D+ or 3/10 its run (which should be a pretty big indicator about how things were going to play out), Destiny did well ratings wise, though nowhere near as good as SEED. Bandai/Sunrise clearly thought they had to strike while the pan was still hot and rushed into production as fast as humanly possible and the result is 50 episodes of… well, you’ll see.Plot: Just like how SEED was a modernised update of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Destiny is a modernised version of Zeta Gundam.

They spend 37 episodes building up a character who never properly completes his character arc. They spend longer utterly destroying the characters of SEED. They spend the entire godforsaken run throwing out every single shred of goodwill and hope SEED had built up and treating the audience like total morons. AGE may have be boring and NT may be totally fucking stupid but Destiny feels like an almost deliberate attempt of sabotage. And the worst part, the absolute worst part, is that its ultimately pointless. Everything basically returns to the exact same way it did at the end of SEED. This isn’t like Zeta where the events of the show massively shape how the next two decades of UC story play out, this is nothing. The status quo of uneasy peace is upheld. The archangel crew win, again. ZAFT and the Alliance are left crippled and with egg on their faces. There’s a movie coming out sometime in the next whenever, so maybe Destiny’s events will be built upon and expanded, but will they really? Can we trust Sunrise to not just redo the plot of SEED again except this time on the big screen? God help us all and remember, SHINN IS WIN.Pros: the fantastic music, Shinn, solid Gundam designs (except the Akatsuki, holy shit), decent action scenes, seeing Yzak and Dearka again is always a treat.Cons: atrocious character development, the slap in the face finale, extreme stock footage, reused plot beats, absurd plot twists, mind numbing dialogue (especially in the last stretch), a shocking amount of filler, useless characters (looking at you, Meer)Overall rating: D+ or 3/10', ""]one short comment :Oh please....Stop copying star wars mixed with dorama(or telenovela , precisely) story .

The music is very epic; character really match with real life. I mean it makes sense that 16 years old student, who suddently becomes pilot has to whine alot after seen all these bloody and loss of lives. It s true that the series is nothing new adding to it; but the plot and appearance ain't bad. The reason people tend to hate it is because it is kinda repetitive to other gundam. This series tend to have more romance and...lots way better mecha fight. if you like a mecha fight and lots of romancce, then this is the one for u. lots way better mecha fight. if you like a mecha fight and lots of romancce, then this is the one for u."", 'Gundam seed destiny was the best Gundam series overall good Character especially the new ones I saw Gundam seed destiny first. Every time i watch this it Gives me strong impression on me.The stoyline was good I like how the switched the Main character back to Kira Yamato. Character development was petty good. I liked Music in the Battle scenes I think people who seen Gundam seed will enjoy Gundam seed destiny. ', 'In my opinion, I\'m being VERY lenient when it comes to this anime. I actually felt a little INSULTED after watching it all. So now, I have to pretend that this sequel never happened . . . that Gundam Seed ENDED WITH GUNDAM SEED!!!What I Liked: Hmm. . . . The fact that they offered us some HOPE when it came to the characters\' fate.What I DIDN\'T Like: Pretty much everything. Shinn, for example, was just another way of the writers saying, ""Yeah, we\'ve ran out of ideas for our main characters, so we\'re going to throw in Generic Emo Kid Number One.""...Now, I have nothing against Shinn\'s background, but I\'m just saying this type of ripoff doesn\'t belong in the franchise. Every popular anime has a main character with the same sob story. This show didn\'t even NEED Shinn Asuka. In fact, I\'m still trying to figure out what the crap he was doing there. . . .All of the characters contradicted themselves. They went from being some of my favorite anime characters to some of the most annoying. And I hate saying this considering I LOVED the original show and how the people related to each other. But it\'s like that all flew out the window. It tore my heart out to see some stuff happen, like the writer was doing this on purpose.Now, I recommend this show only if you haven\'t seen the first once. I can see someone liking this show if you don\'t know the characters\' background as well.Overall, I give this ""sequel"" a 6/10, just because it wouldn\'t be so bad if I hadn\'t gotten so attatched to the characters. My enjoyment was practically zilch, considering it felt more like torture. Now, I have nothing against Shinn\'s background, but I\'m just saying this type of ripoff doesn\'t belong in the franchise.

War is the underlying factor that Gundam is based on and it will forever recur.Gundam SEED Destiny is good if you're a more serious person, I've noticed that those who prefer humor in their anime tend to be unable to watch Gundam SEED or SEED Destiny because of its lack of humor. I'll admit to being addicted to it, I watched SEED Destiny in 2 days. The original Gundam SEED...was watched after Destiny.Overall, in my opinion a great anime, and if anyone ever thinks about it, very easy for you to refer to when you're writing an English essay or something with a central theme of belonging or persecution given its setting. was watched after Destiny.Overall, in my opinion a great anime, and if anyone ever thinks about it, very easy for you to refer to when you're writing an English essay or something with a central theme of belonging or persecution given its setting."", 'I LOVED THIS BUT I HATED SHINN. The first Seed was absolutely amazing. Destiny was very close to it. If you liked Seed then i highly recommend you watch this as well. The only thing i hated about this is the new pilot they introduce Shinn Asuka is the most retarded character in the whole anime. You grew to fall in love with Athrun and Kira in the Gundam Seed. It picks up 2 years after the end of the Great War and in the first parts of the new Season it focuses on Cagali and Athrun ""Alex Dino"". It\'s story is amazing as Gundam...Seed was but if you hate pointless crying there is 10x more and Cagali probably cries about 400 times in the first 20 episodes. Other than that they have this idiot, Shinn Auska who thinks that he is the only person who has lost people in the war an is a total little girl about it. When one of the people that wreaked havoc in Western Eurasia and destroyed 3 cities Kira killed her. And Shinn is all like OMG you killed her i loved her. But his mission was to destroy the DESTROYER and the pilot after it killed THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE and Shinn acts like its all Kira\'s fault and hates him for it. I\'m sorry but honestly i hope Shinn Asuka is killed at the end of this anime because he isSMALL SPOILER NOT VERY BIGWhen Zaft is ordered to Destroy the Freedom and the Archangel in episode 34Kira does not try to kill Shinn just to disable his Mobile Suit but Shinn tries his hardest to kill Kira for stopping a monster who was killing innocent people.

Also it does complete the story better and i thought more action was involved in this one. ', ""I really did enjoy it up until the Berlin, but from there it went bad. Kira becomes the main focus again, instead of the kid we're supposed to know of. This series is RIDDLED with flashbacks all over the place. Zeta worked better even when Amuro appeared you knew it was about Kammile, not Amuro, this one though you can't tell if Kira is supposed to be the main character or supporting.I liked the Strike Freedom but even that alone could not redeem this horrible series. This is basically, erasing what happened at the end of seed and calling it the best thing ever. "", 'In life, there are examples to follow and there are examples to avoid. Gundam Seed Destiny (GSD) is definitely an example of how not to produce an animated weekly television series.The premise isn\'t bad in and of itself: What if, as the emo hero from series 1, you destroy the family of a completely innocent person and turn him into an anti-hero?That\'s fine, that\'s well and good, but this is Gundam. Gundam regularly deals with things as big as diplomacy and intrigue between powerful alliances in addition to the personal stories of the individuals caught up in conflict involving giant robots. The problem with this...show is, it didn\'t do a particularly good job of writing a large-scale conflict convincingly. Rather, it handed everyone but ZAFT The Stoopid Ball (TM) and they blundered into a new conflict despite all the lives slaughtered in the previous one. I know humanity, particularly the bigoted folks, aren\'t particularly good at learning from mistakes, but seriously?But that\'s not the only reason I\'m hammering this show particularly hard. Oh no, it gets better. So at a cursory glance, you\'d think this show is looking to Zeta Gundam as its model, just as series 1 of the Cosmic Era looked to the first Gundam series. So Shinn is the hero of the series, right? Well, you\'d be dead wrong. Just after the first cour, the hero from series 1 dusts off his Gundam and proceeds to deliver his patented Beam Spam of Justice as a sort-of freedom fighter. Here the militaries react rather realistically for once-- they both treat him and his faction as hostile instead of having an instant lobotomy and sitting there shocked that this guy would only destroy their weapons systems.So the series 2 protag, having his thunder well and truly stolen and his love interest Four, I mean, Stella, killed, loses his marbles and goes on a killing spree, and it was all downhill from there. Yes, Shinn became one of the main villains of the series largely for revenge, and it was more cringeworthy to watch and hear him whine to the end than to watch Anakin in the Star Wars prequels.Actually, I don\'t blame the characters, I blame the people in charge of the story: the series director and the scenario writers. Re-introducing Kira into the conflict without a sufficiently coherent plan was a little like jumping the center divider on a busy highway and flooring it in the wrong direction. Bold, sure, but boldly slamming into an oncoming semi truck just makes you look insane, stupid, suicidal, or some combination of these. Now, I understand why they brought him back: the scene where he rescues his ""family"" from spec ops carrying out Stupid Ballz orders (you know, killing civilians, the usual war crime stuff) is quite good. The problem, however, is that the show didn\'t know what the hell to do with him and the Archangel once they started their one-ship-and-one-Gundam circus.Because no one, including the director, had a clear or believable answer, the remaining 3 cours were either a slow-motion train wreck or a scramble to try to hit plot points by a certain schedule, and you know they were failing hard because there were, I believe, 3 recap clip shows. Normally you\'d see 1 recap episode in a good 4-cour anime (and no, A-1, you don\'t do it in a 2-cour series); 2 wouldn\'t be terribly unusual, but 3 or more is a sign that the production is really struggling. I wouldn\'t be surprised if high-level production crew like the episode directors or line producers weren\'t happy with how the show was going. I know I and many other viewers at the time were going, ""What the hell is going on in Sunrise??"" By the final cour, the plot twists were so ridiculous (""Ohai I wuz vaporized in series 1, but I\'m alive!"" ""Ohai, I\'m a clone!""), I was calling this the most ridiculous Gundam since Double Zeta or G Gundam. AGE was better planned and executed, though I\'m sure fans of this show will disagree.And considering the star-studded voice cast and the theme songs sung by hit artists of the day, it\'s simply a crying shame to see all that talent wasted on a show whose sole entertainment value was seeing how hard it would fail and how many times they would recycle the same exact animation sequences in the fight scenes. Except the first OP. I could never understand why TM Revolution is so popular when he looks and sounds like a screaming drag queen when he sings his own songs in concert (when he sings normally, he\'s actually fantastic); Nishikawa voiced a high-ranking officer in the show and was promptly written out because Reasons.

damage to him when he see he's family died right before his eyesand we see how he react so annoying and obsessed of justice and prevent the nonsense war and he didn't want others to have same fate has

:  Although most Gundam Seed fans seem to worship at the temple of Kira Yamamoto , I found myself hating him not only in GS but in gsd , there no character development with him he has no personality, in GS all he did was get stronger with more battle and whine ,and in gsd all he did...was fight and sprout his idealistic crap . not sure if this is the right word for this but he very generic , super

I honestly see little point in this season existing, but it at least wasn't boring. There are a lot of genuinely good ideas here, but their execution is lacking, which makes it disappointing even off of its own merits. I would like to note that I watched the HD remaster.I would also like to note that I was lucky enough to watch the fan edit that combined the old English dub with the newer HD-remaster. This English dub was very good and, like the standard definition English dub of Gundam Seed, I preferred it over the...Japanese voices. If you can watch the show with theis dub, then I recommend you give it a try, assuming you're already familiar with the old dub from Gundam Seed, because this is done by the same people.There are a lot of issues with Seed Destiny, the most noticeable problem is the absurd amount of animation reuse. The reuse extends even to animation from the first season and only gets more and more annoying as the season goes on, it actively made me roll my eyes regularly. The animation causes most battles to feel identical because of this, I swear there are some battles that mostly consist of reused animation re-edited into a different scene, which is just pathetic. This show will also use flashback animations as much as possible which I found pretty obnoxious, it feels like the anime staff were trying to do anything but animate the fucking show.The series also has an unbalanced cast of characters, it introduces too many characters and takes far too long to develop them if they even get any development at all. One of the main characters, Shinn, is pretty insufferable most of the time. Much of his ideals are interesting, but his personality makes him anything but likeable. It also feels like Shinn had to be an extremely pathetic person for the plot to even happen in the first place, if he wasn't an obnoxious asshole this season might've been mercifully short. One character in particular was introduced only to die an episode later for dramatic effect, but they use his death to force drama between characters that already overcame this exact same fucking drama in the first season. I found things like this to be insulting to watch as a fan of Gundam Seed, this utterly lacks the tightly written characters and story that show had.There aren't many things I like about this season, as most interesting things eventually become uninteresting before they finish. I will say that I like the inclusion of chairman Durandal as a character, he is probably the most interesting character in this season. I also think I like the shift in focus to Athrun as the main character, instead of Kira, the last season's main character.Similar to Gundam Seed, a lot of effort was put into the recap episodes, they edit the recap into the story to the point that it makes sense that they would mention the old stuff while adding new stuff on top of it. This comes as a double edged sword, because it makes the recap episodes not as boring, but also means you can't skip them entirely because there is some new content in those episodes that you will miss if you do. One of the main characters,chairman  Durandal, is given a lot of development during a recap episode, which I imagine many people would've missed by skipping the episode.Honestly, I've seen worse, but Gundam Seed Destiny is still a huge mess. I'm mostly just disappointed because of how great Seed was. It might be worth a watch if you like Seed but don't expect it to be good, I struggle to recommend this in good faith. Japanese voices.

If it's not original, that's ok, however it should be captivating and explore the themes before to a greater depth....What I watched instead was a recycled pov from the zaft side, which was good, up until the protagonist of the series suddenly switches to kira and athrun and it became seed all over again. Why bother making a sequel if it's going to be the same as the sequel? If the point was to state history repeats itself it's already apparent with the release of all the other AU series and most apparent in the UC series. Even before seed came along the themes were borrowed from UC.Art: 7/10 it was above average for it's time but this isn't very important to me.Sound 8/10 besides the ridiculous chemistry opening song, everything was pretty good or very good incl insert songs, bgm, and sound effects.Character: 1/10 Shinn gets development until the plot suddently recasts him as an antagonist. Characters just felt like cheap ripoffs of the originals they were based off of shinn - kamille, athrun - char, kira - amuro, stella - four. Being the cheap ripoffs they are, they don't have the same likeability as the originals with the exception of lunamaria - fa since they were both supporting minor characters it felt more or less the same. The art and sound makes up for the lack of depth of most of the characters.Enjoyment: 3/10 I really dislike it when newer AU shows just take a UC technology or a previous AU technology change it a little, and rename it, this is only ok in comedic series. You can call it tributes all you want but I just see it as ripping it off from the original. Stolen technologies including something that is similar to shining finger, the MEPE after image effect, psycommu, funnels, VSBR, psycho gundam,  cyber newtype, zeta gundam.Conclusion: 3/10 heavy weighting on story and character.If this is your first gundam series, or one of the first ones you have seen, it will seem ok and a pretty good series  and you should watch it since it will be mildly entertaining since the flaws won't be as apparent. There are some good parts of the plot . If you have seen many before, and don't like series that ripoff of other series and intend to watch this series as a serious series of gundam then I do not recommend this one if you don't have time. If you have plenty of time watch it by all means just so you have watched a gundam series and know what it is about.

Yes, I\'m talking about people like WackyModder84 et al. To be honest, I think people like him have good points here and there, freedom of expression and all. It\'s just that I believe this series deserves more justice than what Western and non-Japanese fans are giving it.Story: It\'s not perfect. In fact it\'s heavily flawed, especially towards the late middle and until the end. The fact that you need to watch SEED first to even understand some of the things going on here is...already saying something about this series. But for all its flaws, it was pretty good. For one, I could understand what the creators and writers were going through, fan flak on one end and cancer on the other. Thus I gave it the fair rating. But once you do manage to get the sequence of it all, it actually has a pretty good plot. Not great, just worthy enough. For me, it took around 3 or 4 rewatches of this series just to get what went on, etc. So, if you\'re going to give this series  story a chance, proceed with extreme caution, as there will be Western Gundam fans bashing this series (just waiting to flame the prowling fanboy or fangirl with negative or offensive comments on forums and websites), and watch SEED first.Art: This is one of the series stronger points. For the most part, I loved, and still love the mech designs. In fact, I can recall falling in love with more than 1 of the Mobile Suits from this and SEED, especially the Murasame. The characters themselves however suffer from a case of having only 7 or so faces, though for the most part its only partially noticeable thanks to the characters having different eye and hair colors, styles, etc. The problem for most people, including myself, would be the stock footage that\'s predominant every now and then. And that\'s why it gets a fair rating from me. Though, thankfully, when the HD Remaster version came out last year, at least some of these problems were fixed.Sound: This is arguably its strongest area. The intro songs ""Ignited"" and ""Pride"" remain some of my favorite opening themes to date. The ending themes are no slouch either once you get to hear them. My only real problem in this category would be the theme used in the 4th opening of the HD Remaster version,  ""Vestige"". It\'s a good theme, yes, just not suitable for an opening theme.Character: Arguably one of the weaker points here, especially with regards to Shinn. While he does get the most development out of any other character, all or most of it was negative. Though, arguably, his character was one of the more realistic cases I\'ve seen out there. Seriously, how would you feel if you were in his shoes? Other problems I had were how the later episodes dealt with perspective flip, as well as how it dealt with other characters which had potential, though in fairness Gundam shows tend to love randomly killing off people, so its kind of a mixed bag. Back on the topic of perspective flip, it was actually okay in my opinion, if you take into account of the reveal in some of the earlier episodes and/or rewatch and analyze like I have. As with story, proceed with extreme caution.Enjoyment: For all its flaws, I still find it watchable. It\'s kind of a guilty pleasure if you take into account the flame war and hate comments this show has received in the past. Probably because I first watched this series back when I was still in elementary and high school, meaning I have kind of a nostalgia filter. Others might think differently. I would only recommend this series if you have watched SEED.Overall: I\'d give this series a 7/10. While I loved the MS designs and the OST, the flaws are still what hold this one back from me recommending this over other Gundam shows. It\'s not horrible, the fact that it did REALLY well in Japan is saying something.

In a nutshell, Seed Destiny is a good closure of the events you saw on Gundam Seed, thus, I strongly recommend it but be prepared for some bad decision in terms of the protagonist. I recommend you see my review of Seed first, so you understand many of my points of view. Ikimasu!Story: The story of Seed Destiny has a similar background of Seed because it is a follow-up. Thus, you will have no problem following and will get comfortable fast. Although the military and...political settings are similar, Seed Destiny has a major plot twist. Of course, I won`t tell you, but there is a catch, and it is a great one. Even though I enjoyed the plot, the fights, and the military aspects, which, by their turns, are even more on point than on Seed, there is one issue that was the cause of my score is 6: there is too much redundancy in many speeches and dialogs. Does this sound a weak argument for you? Well, it isn't. It gets repetitive to a bore. In addition, some shonen aspects that Seed had it right, Seed Destiny does not. For example, the drama in Seed was mostly understandable and you can go along with it. But in Seed Destiny, some shonen aspects are just to exaggerated. Too...Much. Another negative point is that you will see too many flashbacks. I am not a fan of flashbacks, they affect the story to a fault if not done right, and sometimes, Seed Destiny sins in this aspect. Either way, as a say, the plot is great, the fights are great, and the plot twist is pretty good. Seed Destiny closes the story in a satisfactory way. Finally, I must say that the nice thing about Seed and Seed Destiny, is that here you will know that their goal is not only the political and military aspects but the bad side of science too. And as a scientist myself, I like to see some people argue about it in a mature way (not everything are rainbows).Art and Sound: The art is slightly better than Seed, but not by a good margin. So it is not that good. The sound, for me, was also downgraded. Seed had some epic OST,  but Seed Destiny has no memorable soundtrack.Character: Oh boy, here comes the mixed feelings. The reason I gave a 7 (Good) here, is because of the recurrent characters, such as Kira, Athrun, Murrue, Gladys, Rey, and some other secondary characters that were well done and someone that I can`t say without spoiling. Kira and Athrun are way more mature now, so the writers took into consideration that they are veterans, this was a great call. The antagonist is also AMAZING. Thus, its because they were so well developed that is why I was able to leave a 7. The reason I couldn't raise the score was a result of some factors. First was the horrendous degradation Cagalli had. She was not that great on Seed, but on Seed Destiny, she is a moron, with a slight development in the end. She was a girl of action, now she is a slug. The other is the existence of Meer Campbell (yet, I do see that Meer is like a critic to the Japanese Idol industry). You will see it. And now for number two, Stella. She is one of the most ridiculous characters in the Gundam franchise. She has everything on the profane list: badly written, you lack empathy for her, annoying actions, annoying voice, annoying peculiarities. Man, you name it. Stella is just unbearable, and the series TRY to sell her to you, so you care for her, but it fails miserably. I am a person who knows a lot about writing since I am one myself, in addition to being a researcher. So I can say that I try to ALWAYS look beyond my opinions on these characters, or what I would do, or what are my preferences. But Stella is just way too ridiculous and is a negative point for the series (for me, Stella is, by far, the worse Gundam character ever made). And for the main course, you have Shinn, the new protagonist. Shinn is an angry mot****f******. However, in the beginning, up to episode 30, you get him. He is a classic angry shonen character that you know will change for the better. He screws up, but says some facts straight on people's faces sometimes, which is great. Then, after episode 30, Shinn CHANGED in the most HORRENDOUS and F****** ANNOYING way possible. He became my NUMBER 1 most annoying Gundam pilot, and I saw a lot of Gundam. Before him, the most annoying protagonist for me was Banagher Links, from Unicorn (see my review if you want), but Shinn took his place with high honors. I can`t describe how ridiculous Shinn is. I have absolutely NO IDEA why the writers chose that path. Banagher is a bad protagonist, but he makes sense in his script. He has a path and tries to follow. Shinn is egocentric, angry, hypocrite, arrogant, prideful, hypocrite, impolite, undisciplined, hypocrite, and many other bad personality traits. If was for Shinn, my score would be 1 here. But thanks to Kira, Athrun, and others I could give it a 7. If you saw my review of Gundam Seed, you saw that I mentioned that Seed is a remake of the original for the younger generation. Well, Seed Destiny is a remake of Zeta Gundam. Kira inherited Amuro`s good side, while Shinn inherited every other s****y trait that Kamille had in the beginning, but different from Kamille, Shinn only shows some growth in the end.Mechas: Well, as a Gunpla builder, I have to talk about the mechas. They are superb, in here Seed Destiny was on point. Impulse has a unique mechanical and strategic gimmick, which is extremely original, not repeated anywhere else. Other MS, such as Destroy, was also very distinguished on Seed Destiny. Some Gundam is similar to others, like Abyss, which is basic AquaDeathScythe, and Chaos, your standard Gundam-with-big-cannons. However, Gaia`s gimmicks are original for ground tactics. I have a problem with Destiny Gundam, because they made him just like Freedom basically, taking away his importance. Freedom is still my favorite from Seed and Seed Destiny, but damn, Gundam Akatsuki is absolutely beautiful. Akatsuki is the remake of Hyaku-Shiki, from Zeta.Overall, Seed Destiny should be watched, because it has an excellent conclusion to Seed`s plots. Most characters are well developed, especially the recurrent ones. The mechas are amazing and the antagonist is one of my favorites from the Gundamverse. However, be prepared for extra flashbacks, redundant speeches, and ... Stella..... and worse of all.... be prepared for Shinn Asuka...... Still, people, don`t miss because of two characters. It still has a great plot, military environment, nice talk about the bad side of science, other good characters, and good closure. political settings are similar, Seed Destiny has a major plot twist. Of course, I won`t tell you, but there is a catch, and it is a great one. Even though I enjoyed the plot, the fights, and the military aspects, which, by their turns, are even more on point than on Seed, there is one issue that was the cause of my score is 6: there is too much redundancy in many speeches and dialogs. Does this sound a weak argument for you? Well, it isn't. It gets repetitive to a bore. In addition, some shonen aspects that Seed had it right, Seed Destiny does not. For example, the drama in Seed was mostly understandable and you can go along with it. But in Seed Destiny, some shonen aspects are just to exaggerated. Too...Much. Another negative point is that you will see too many flashbacks. I am not a fan of flashbacks, they affect the story to a fault if not done right, and sometimes, Seed Destiny sins in this aspect. Either way, as a say, the plot is great, the fights are great, and the plot twist is pretty good. Seed Destiny closes the story in a satisfactory way. Finally, I must say that the nice thing about Seed and Seed Destiny, is that here you will know that their goal is not only the political and military aspects but the bad side of science too. And as a scientist myself, I like to see some people argue about it in a mature way (not everything are rainbows).Art and Sound: The art is slightly better than Seed, but not by a good margin. So it is not that good. The sound, for me, was also downgraded. Seed had some epic OST,  but Seed Destiny has no memorable soundtrack.Character: Oh boy, here comes the mixed feelings. The reason I gave a 7 (Good) here, is because of the recurrent characters, such as Kira, Athrun, Murrue, Gladys, Rey, and some other secondary characters that were well done and someone that I can`t say without spoiling. Kira and Athrun are way more mature now, so the writers took into consideration that they are veterans, this was a great call. The antagonist is also AMAZING. Thus, its because they were so well developed that is why I was able to leave a 7. The reason I couldn't raise the score was a result of some factors. First was the horrendous degradation Cagalli had. She was not that great on Seed, but on Seed Destiny, she is a moron, with a slight development in the end. She was a girl of action, now she is a slug. The other is the existence of Meer Campbell (yet, I do see that Meer is like a critic to the Japanese Idol industry). You will see it. And now for number two, Stella. She is one of the most ridiculous characters in the Gundam franchise. She has everything on the profane list: badly written, you lack empathy for her, annoying actions, annoying voice, annoying peculiarities. Man, you name it. Stella is just unbearable, and the series TRY to sell her to you, so you care for her, but it fails miserably. I am a person who knows a lot about writing since I am one myself, in addition to being a researcher. So I can say that I try to ALWAYS look beyond my opinions on these characters, or what I would do, or what are my preferences. But Stella is just way too ridiculous and is a negative point for the series (for me, Stella is, by far, the worse Gundam character ever made). And for the main course, you have Shinn, the new protagonist. Shinn is an angry mot****f******. However, in the beginning, up to episode 30, you get him. He is a classic angry shonen character that you know will change for the better. He screws up, but says some facts straight on people's faces sometimes, which is great. Then, after episode 30, Shinn CHANGED in the most HORRENDOUS and F****** ANNOYING way possible. He became my NUMBER 1 most annoying Gundam pilot, and I saw a lot of Gundam. Before him, the most annoying protagonist for me was Banagher Links, from Unicorn (see my review if you want), but Shinn took his place with high honors. I can`t describe how ridiculous Shinn is. I have absolutely NO IDEA why the writers chose that path. Banagher is a bad protagonist, but he makes sense in his script. He has a path and tries to follow. Shinn is egocentric, angry, hypocrite, arrogant, prideful, hypocrite, impolite, undisciplined, hypocrite, and many other bad personality traits. If was for Shinn, my score would be 1 here. But thanks to Kira, Athrun, and others I could give it a 7. If you saw my review of Gundam Seed, you saw that I mentioned that Seed is a remake of the original for the younger generation. Well, Seed Destiny is a remake of Zeta Gundam. Kira inherited Amuro`s good side, while Shinn inherited every other s****y trait that Kamille had in the beginning, but different from Kamille, Shinn only shows some growth in the end.Mechas: Well, as a Gunpla builder, I have to talk about the mechas. They are superb, in here Seed Destiny was on point. Impulse has a unique mechanical and strategic gimmick, which is extremely original, not repeated anywhere else. Other MS, such as Destroy, was also very distinguished on Seed Destiny. Some Gundam is similar to others, like Abyss, which is basic AquaDeathScythe, and Chaos, your standard Gundam-with-big-cannons. However, Gaia`s gimmicks are original for ground tactics. I have a problem with Destiny Gundam, because they made him just like Freedom basically, taking away his importance. Freedom is still my favorite from Seed and Seed Destiny, but damn, Gundam Akatsuki is absolutely beautiful. Akatsuki is the remake of Hyaku-Shiki, from Zeta.Overall, Seed Destiny should be watched, because it has an excellent conclusion to Seed`s plots. Most characters are well developed, especially the recurrent ones. The mechas are amazing and the antagonist is one of my favorites from the Gundamverse. However, be prepared for extra flashbacks, redundant speeches, and ... Stella..... and worse of all.... be prepared for Shinn Asuka...... Still, people, don`t miss because of two characters.

I will politely disagree. This anime is as good, if not better, than Gundam Seed. The story didn't really taper off and although sequels have a hard time making the story original, this one pulled it off. There were enough references to the past to make Gundam Seed fans interested in it, but enough new characters to keep the plot fresh. If you watched Gundam Seed and really enjoyed it, I think you should watch Gundam Seed Destiny.If you haven't watched...Gundam Seed, then before you watch this you should probably watch that first cause this might get a little confusing.On a side note, I loved the music in this anime. Both the instrumentals and the vocals, it was great. The placement of the music in the anime was great also, obviously not OP and EP's. If you like music in the middle of your anime, this has a couple that makes it good.

But are they really looking deep into the story, or are they jsu watching it from the surface? One mistake people have always made when watching Destiny is especting this series to be like Zeta. Guess what, it\'s not Zeta. Be glad, because everyone have done enough complaining about Seed being like 0079, and we don\'t need more complaints about Destiny being too much like Zeta. One more fault is thinking the title is representing the main gundam of...this series, and thinking that character would be the ""main"" focus, but that isn\'t so. Seed and Destiny are probably the only Gundam series where the title pretty much have nothing to do with the main character\'s suit.To start off, this series isn\'t something where you watch onnce and would understand everything. You would probably have to watch it atbleast 2 to 3 times. In order to try not to spoil anythjng, the general outline is that it has been 2 year after Seed, and that the world has gone back into a state of war, where Naturals and Coordinators are fighting against each other again. This would follow the involvement of the new casts, and returning casts in this war.For art, there isn\'t much to say since it\'s pretty much the same artist that drew for Seed. But I have to say, the animation/battles could be better, but the remaster somewhat raised to score for it.Next is the music. This is one of the best points of thus series, like it was for Seed. Till this day, I feel that EVERY ost/songs used were the best, unlike other series. There\'s like no words to express jow much I loved the music in this.Moving on are the characters. This time, we aren\'t give a protagonist like Kira, or pass Gundam protagonist. In fact we are fiving a protagonist that has anger issues, and can easily anmoy the viewers. Anyways, I\'m sure you know that this character\'s name is Shinn Asuka. He has lost his whole family during the previous war, amd has decided to join ZAFT. People think that the writers would give Shinn a positive development, but are mistaken for that. In fact, he is given a negative development. Believe it or not, that is character development. Apparently everyone thinks the only type of character development is positive development. To get back on rrack, this negative development really sets Shinn to be an anti-hero like tge writers wanted him to be. They intended Shinn to lose at the end from the very beginning. People really need to accept this, and that he is a tragic hero too. Shinn went from a guy who has lost his family, to an even more of a tragic guy losing Stella who he sees as his replacment for his sister. But this is what gives him his resolve to change the world. That is why he followed the destiny plan, believing that the world will change and that no one will suffer like he did. That\'s not called being a labdog, like you hear people say he is.Athrun, as you have heard people say, have gone through the ae character arc, but that isn\'t so. They clearly stated in the beginning of the series that he still haven\'t found an answer. But at the same time, a war was breaking out, amd he wanted to do something, In which Durandal gave him a purpose, which became an answer for his question back in Seed. That is why he returned to ZAFT.Kira, believe it or not, has character development, unlike what others have said. He, at the beginning, felt that he has to do something I  which he did, but he spends the series wondering if what he has been doing this time is the correct thing to do, amd what he really should be doing. By the end of the series with his confrontation with Durandal(one of the best scenes of the series. It gets you thinking) he has arrived on an answer.Rey, I would have to say that they could expand on him more, but I still like his character. Many has said he was turned a 180 of his xgaracter at the ens, but it isn\'t so. He has spend his whole time fighting for Durandal, changing the world so people won\'t suffer from the short telemorose like he is going through. He also believes that there is not meaning to his life other than helping Durandal, and doesn\'t seethe consequences in Durandal\'s plan and seeing no hope in the current world. Kira is the one that chabges him. He was able to see how important life really is and how important freedom is. That\'s why he went against Durandal. He has finalky come to value his life. That he wants a tomorrow, unlike how there isn\'t a tomorrow in Durandal\'s world.The final major character is Durandal. Despite peolme saying he becane a villian all of a sudden that is not true. The biggest hint would be in episode 29. Many see him as a villian, but really he isn\'t. Like many he wants to change the wormd for the better, but uses the wrong way to do it.Overall, the series is not as bad as people make it out to be. This series is probably one of the series with impressive themes. That\'s also another highlight of this series. It\'s also fun to figure out the themes within this series, which you would not figure out all of them through only watching it once. this series, and thinking that character would be the ""main"" focus, but that isn\'t so.

Luckily if the movie ever gets released it may change the opinion of the world, who knows. ', 'Mobile suit gundam seed destiny is the direct sequal to the (in my opinion) very good mobile suit gundam seed. The latter was about dynamic characters dealing racism, war, realizing things about themselves, and giant robots! Seed desinty is about ... characters... and giant robots!STORY 4/10The story is pretty damn bad if I say so myself. Theres not a whole lot to talk about without getting into spoilers, but I can give you a brief synopsis: everyone is happy that the war is over, so countries are enjoying peace. One day some bad stuff happens, people die, people get mad, Athrum gets laid and giant...robots! I honestly don’t remeber the bulk of the story. Its not all bad, in fact I do remember some of the more competent, intesne, well-written scenes. One of my favorite things about OG seed were the themes about racism, war and society. Although there is much less commentary than gundam seed, the ones present in Destiny I found to be very well done. The politics, reasoning and philosophy behind war are explored and it creates some very interesting scenes in a pretty large pool of average. Id also say that the story drags on like a bitch! If this show was shorter than 50 episodes, then we would have a more straight-forward, coherent and focused story, because it often gets side-tracked. Plot points are introduced and are either forgotten about or resolved oddly quick. The central conflict becomes a mute point later on - assuming there was a central conflict to begin with.CHARACTERS 6/10A mixed bag. Seeing as though this is an etirely new series, there’s bound to be new characters, but seeing as though this is a continuation to another series, there would be recurring characters. Throughout the series I felt like the 2 casts of characters were fighting for screen time. My absolute favorite part of gundam seed were the characters. Very well developed, dynamic and interesting. Athrum and Kira’s arcs made the show as good as it was. Needless to say I was stoaked to see them return, but I was not stoked to see them done horribly. For starters Athrum’s character completely resets, making all development in gundam seed null and void. Also, since these charatcers already went through very good arcs in the previous show, they can’t grow any more. A charatcer arc means they start out as something and grow to become the opposite. If the story were to continue after the charatcer has his/her arc, then we’d just start where we began! Athrum grows backwards, Kira doesn’t grow at all, Lacus is replaced by some whore who calls herself Lacus, and Cagalli is depressingly less badass than she was in seed.So how are the new characters? This is where the good things in the show start appearing. Not all of the new characters are done very well (one of them is the aforementioned whore), but the ones that are make this show worth it at times. Shinn, Stella and Durandal are probably the best parts of this show. Right off the bat, Shinn had an intriguing backstory, clear motives, a goal one can get behind, and to top it off he completely changes in a good way. Although the story wasn’t bery good or memorable, I do remember and appreciate the finale, not because its the most recent thing I watched, but because Shinn’s arc made it happen and made it as good as it was. I’m aware that not a lot of people like Shinn, because he is not a good replacement for Kira. That I can agree with, but I also say that its a good thing. If all Destiny ever did was copy the good parts of seed, then we’d have entirely different problems. I’m glad that most of the new characters go in different directions than I expected.ANIMATION 6/10Overall, I bashed on the animation in Seed. The characters looked ugly, every action scene had 5 minutes of recycled footage and the openings were 100% garbage. This show was made a few years later, so you’d think there was time to improve, right? I will say that the character designs have improved, no one looks like weird ape babies anymore. But every thing else, not so much. The action scenes do have less recycled footage on average, but less miscellaneous shots being reused are replaced by an uncomfortably long transformation sequence, that when paired with the launch sequence that starts every battle, adds up to about 5 minutes, which isn’t that different from seed when you think about it. The openings have some how gotten worse. The songs are not bad, but the shots and animatons during the opening are once again bad. Very bad. In all 4 openings there is a drop that leads into the chorus, and in 3 of these openings, the same exact shot plays during this drop, followed by the same action shots, and the same closing shot and its all just Ugh!!SOUND 6/10As said before the songs used in the openings are not bad. Much like a lot of other anime, the soundtrack within the epiodes never stood out or were memorable, but not every soundtrack has to sound like “the dark side of the moon,” so its ok. The dub is very bad. The gundam seed dub wasn’t that great either, or at least, not until the last quarter or so when adrew francis came into play and somehow the voice cast magically dscovered how to make themselves sound like humans. Destiny never has this. The dub sucks from beginnign to end. Durandal has a good voice and Shinn delivers a very touching monologue, done pretty well in english, but thats not enough. Watch it subbed please, that voice cast was really good.OVERALL 6/10This didn’t need to be made. There were no interesting plot points, commentary or character arcs that weren’t done better than seed before it. Everything, except for maybe the action and animation, was done better in seed. This show has left me with such a hollow experience, that I really just stopped caring altogether towards the end. Come episode 37 or somewhere around there, I cared so little I was contemplating dropping it. But the potential for greatness, good new characters, cool action scenes and occasional great episodes kept me watching it. In the end, I don’t regret watching it, but if I didn’t watch it, nothing in my life would’ve changed. In fact I would now have a free 25 hours I couldve spent watching something else. robots!

It’s a sequel to a reimaging, yet one of many alternative stories of the original. So here’s what I liked. i liked the fact there was action in nearly every episode, and that’s what i watched it for; hot mech on mech action. And it was gorgeous, though I watched the HD remaster. I liked the character progression in Athrun and I liked some of the songs.My issues start with the amount of scenes used over and over and over again. How much screen time does the Impulse Gundam's transformation get? Every...single action performed by a mobile suit is animated once and reused, over the span of 50 episodes it’s tiresome. Also all the characters come off as one dimensional, like their point of view of the plot is the only thought in their head. And that’s a problem for a series that seems like 29 episodes of plot and story stretched out to 50. Very little time is allowed for exploring this world or it’s characters. Also the big mysteries and twists come as no surprise. In fact they’re sadly predictable. The whole series is a series of action sequences lazily written together. It’s almost as if the entire point of this series were to sell toys.But ultimately, what I truly didn’t like about this series is there are better versions of this out there. It hurt this series that I’d seen Thunderbolt, 00, Unicorn, G-Reco, IMB, MSG, Zeta, ZZ, The Origin & 08th MS Squad between watching SEED & Destiny. And all of those save ZZ & G-Reco are better than both SEED & Destiny. But is that fair of me? Yes because I watched the HD remaster. I liked it but there are at least eight better versions of the same thing out there. single action performed by a mobile suit is animated once and reused, over the span of 50 episodes it’s tiresome.

This is the core theme and namesake of the show that Gundam Seed Destiny is trying to tell. Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to quite get the message across amidst the many other concurrent themes and ideas that gets swept along the series -- this I mostly blame Bandai, as they severely limited the budget/cost cut for the series for the sakes of corporate profit (see below).Seed Destiny is a divisive and controversial anime, probably one of the most ever for a Gundam series, and the reason for that is probably...because of it's potential. No one gets seriously mad about a bad anime. They simply stop watching and move on. It is when a show that builds up a lot of potential and manages to waste it, that people often get very angry.But first, let's start with the good before we go onto the not-so-good.Good:The first 10 episodes / start of Seed Destiny is amazing and demonstrates superb story writing. Within episode 1, Seed Destiny manages to set its tone, introduces its core characters, establish its theme and show the antagonist's (Shin and Gil) thoughts and motivations all in one go. Its exciting, fast-paced, and raw. We literally see Shin's entire family obliterated in episode 1 in one of the most gory and war-raw scene in Gundam history. There are casualties in war. We often don't think about them as all we see as viewers are the epic gundam fights happening on screen, but it's there, in the unshown background, and Shin's family was the perfect example.Shin's family is given only brief seconds of cameo time, and yet, it is heart-wrenching to watch Shin play over and over again his dead sister's voicemail, using her pink phone as the only item left of her in the living world.Bad:Characters never get fully developed despite the anime being 50 episodes long. As such, viewers are left feeling alienated from Shin as the antagonist/anti-hero. With each passing episode, Shin sinks deeper and deeper into the horrific nature of Gil's schemes, and yet we as viewers do not sympathise with him, because of the rushed and lazy storytelling that becomes gradually more central to Seed Destiny's nature.I attribute much of what went wrong with Seed Destiny to Bandai who had probably severely limited the budget for production -- clearly evident through their abundant reusing of animation (e.g., Zakus pulling out their axe from shield, Impulse slashing twice with beam sabre following a unit, even characters talking animation like Shin shouting whilst cutting down an enemy, etc.). This blatant reuse of animation, hefty long flashbacks (to save animation budget), etc. all contribute to the downfall of what initially started off as a promising Gundam series.In the end, this culminates into one of the worst Gundam endings ever, where the reuse of animation, hefty long flasbacks, etc. ascend to a crescendo at its apex, and the viewers are left angry, shaking, and feeling very rightly so 'ripped off'. Despite this, I give Seed Destiny a good rating here because of its clear potential that was evident throughout the start of the series and the themes/motifs that never really managed to get to the finish line, but were built so strongly that I could just close my eyes and imagine the finish line in my head. because of it's potential. No one gets seriously mad about a bad anime. They simply stop watching and move on. It is when a show that builds up a lot of potential and manages to waste it, that people often get very angry.But first, let's start with the good before we go onto the not-so-good.Good:The first 10 episodes / start of Seed Destiny is amazing and demonstrates superb story writing.

The first season was so perfect to me and I loved it from beginning to end. However, 'Destiny' had some problems which the first season didn't have. The main character Shinn Asuka was soooo annoying how he just purposely try to pick a fight with literally everyone, and his character didn't even improve up to the last episode, or he probably did but it wasn't enough for me to even begin to like him. Whatever your past is, you can always choose to do better and...not take it out on others. Anyway, for what it's worth, I still loved this because it has Kira Yamato and Freedom in it. The first season, I can watch over and over, but this, I would really need to be motivated, or if I want to see Kira being awesome, so yeah... I still consider this an enjoyable watch in the end. not take it out on others. Anyway, for what it's worth, I still loved this because it has Kira Yamato and Freedom in it.

His attitude and feelings while we could try to relate to them they fell short. He was just annoying and really took away from what could have been a fantastic sequel.Still there are some great fighting series and Kira kicks ass and shinn loses (as his whinny ass should). Kira fighting early on in the first couple epsidoes was great and at the end of the...series when he finally pulls out the strike freedom he kills it and it makes the series much more fun to watch. But honestly at this point if you aren\'t fed up with shinn you didnt watch the series fully through series when he finally pulls out the strike freedom he kills it and it makes the series much more fun to watch. But honestly at this point if you aren\'t fed up with shinn you didnt watch the series fully through', ""Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny really started something on the Saga... In my opinion, is the first Gundam that really showed the true feelings of the characters in relation with war. Besides, the script is just awesome, the music... is wow! TM Revolution did a great job!!The story is fantastic and you can really feel the character's emotions through all the series.If someone is a fan of the Gundam series, this is definitely a MUST SEE! "", 'This show starts off amazingly, and the plot really throws you head first into things. The new characters are interesting and I was initially excited to see them fight, learn and grow. Unfortunately, the show had other plans. The show almost seems like its in a constant tug of war between two different shows, ""The Minerva show"" and ""The Archaengel Show"". Maybe this was the intention but it just doesn\'t work. The archangel really doesn\'t show up until halfway through and this is primarily why the first half of the show is when its at its best. The Minerva crew going around, kicking ass and...taking names. When they actually got to have the spotlight of the show.The second half of this show and the ending is genuinely bad. It feels like the writers truly hate Shin because they seem terrified to allow him to be the main character. Half the show is just about the adventures of Kira and his gang. This show wants me so badly to think that Durandal is a bad guy and Kira and his group can do no wrong when, time after time, he keeps getting proven correct. Literally, in the first episode, Cagalli gets mad at him for building up the military, and they get attacked by the blue cosmos, proving him right. It\'s never even clearly explained what the destiny plan was or why it was bad. The only indication you get that he is evil is that he tries to kill Lacus and has some ties with Rau, which no one would even know about. The archangel literally protects Djibril (the actual villain of the show, mind you, and pretty much the only reason this war is happening) and accidentally allows for the destruction of a few plants and the deaths of millions, and the ""heroes"" barely acknowledge this when it happens. Besides that, good characters from seed get bastardized to hell; Cagalli goes from strong, capable, and independent to whiny, impotent, and unable to control the country she\'s supposed to be leading; Kira goes from a complex and flawed character who\'s forced into a war against his will to a Mr. Perfect Mary Sue who can do no wrong and can somehow survive the impossible. Lacus was never that compelling to me, but she\'s even worse here, pretty much just acting as a Kira yes-man or showing up to say some fake-profound nothingburger speech.As time goes on the fights start getting less interesting because the mobile suits just become way too overpowered. Its just Kira shooting everyone without receiving a scratch. It got to the point where I was actively rooting against the archaengel and kira.Also, I was mad that very little was done with Athrun and Cagalli\'s relationship, since they are easily the best couple in this series (way better than Kira and Lacus). All in all, I was disappointed with how this went. The show in its first half was so good, but it manages to ruin it the more you go on. taking names.

There is no true plot in the series other than to follow Rock Lee's humurous life as everyone has been turned into chibis. There is not meant to be any serious action whatsoever.Nonetheless, watching the series is very entertaining and in my opinion, hilarious. The opening and endings are both very adorable and fun to listen to. The little stories that are in each episode can range from the theme of love to the importance of friendship. They have even poke...fun at the anime from time to time.I believe that if you are a true fan of the Naruto franchise and you are looking for a good laugh, you should try to watch this series. Keep in mind, however, there are some people who watch the show and do not find it funny at all. So try it out and see how you feel about it.

Keep in mind, however, there are some people who watch the show and do not find it funny at all. So try it out and see how you feel about it. That's all. :)"", 'This show was what I looked forward to every Tuesday.Do you like Naruto? Do you like Naruto Shippuden? (pretty much the same thing, but whatever) Because I like both, and this show was the highlight to my Tuesday whenever I got home from school.The show just finished yesterday, and honestly, I was gonna cry myself a river because I was so sad it was ending.Lucky for you, as long as you know the characters in Naruto, you can pick up the show in any episode you want and you would still be able to follow what was going on. It has no definite plot line,...just a show centered around Team Guy and a bunch of short stories.The first 5/6 of the show is the best thing ever. Neji cross dresses all the time, which is amazing to watch if you\'re a Neji fan and I laughed so hard every time he did because come on, it\'s Neji for crying out loud! He used to be so serious about his fate and now where is he? Cross dressing. Yes. Tenten has her fan and delivering punchlines all the time to everything stupid Lee does. I was laughing so hard in the first episode when Lee was doing the stupidest training ever, body weaving around this wooden post and sneaking around in a bridge position. It wasn\'t even that funny, but it just made me laugh so hard. You see Naruto and Lee fighting very often over Sakura, and they make the stupidest jokes, meet Akatsuki, Sasuke, Jiraiya, Ichiraku ramen guy, Gaara, the Raikage and, lots of Orochimaru.Orochimaru appears a lot in the show, with some other stupid plan to destroy Konoha or just Lee and his friends. Of course, they never go as planned as he always fails and Kabuto wondering why Orochimaru had such a stupid idea in the first place. It\'s like the bad antagonist that always loses in such an easy manner because the plan wasn\'t even going to work in the first place. Orochimaru DOES kind of win a battle once, though. Like I said earlier, only 5/6 of the show was okay, because the producers began having difficulty and just putting in more and more Orochimaru episodes, as you could tell they were running out of ideas. The last few episodes were okay, though.This show is really good for learning about characters. Characters that pass away or don\'t really appear in the main story are still here and I love that they came back to do an episode or two. You really get to know everyone\'s personalities, their daily routines, how they react towards each other on a daily basis and relations between each other. This isn\'t easily portrayed in the main story because it needs to go along with the plot line and fights and whatnot, so this show was awesome.I particularly love how easy-going Neji is, I learned Lee is crazy although he trains like a madman, Tenten is really well shown as we never hear anything about her in the main story, other than how she fights (Chuunin exams). Naruto is slightly as crazy as Lee, Sai is being emotionless, clueless and funny as always, Sakura being chased by Naruto and Lee (every still has no idea why and why everyone likes her).If you wanna hear about Hinata, you learn that Hinata is actually super crazy and she follows Naruto around so much like a creep and a stalker, but you\'ll find it hilarious because it\'s Hinata! Neji is super infatuated in a father-like situation where he\'s always worried about Hinata and how she likes Naruto, and when Neji calls ""Hinata-sama!"", you will die by the tone in his voice. Way too funny. Quite a few episodes are centered around Hinata\'s love for Naruto and you see their interactions in many episodes, to which Hinata turns bright red and on rare occasions, gets a nosebleed.Girls, if you like Sasuke, like me, (Sasuke-kun! ^.^) the few episodes near the end have Sasuke in it, posing, as a girl, sexy jutsu, with Neji and Lee. Too funny, laughed so hard, Sasuke being adorable as usual. He appears in the first half of the last episode and really, I just loved the Sasuke screentime. Lee\'s team encounters Sasuke\'s team Taka in one episode.So again, if you love Naruto or Naruto Shippuden, this show is a must-watch if you have free time or just wanna watch for a good laugh. I highly recommend it! just a show centered around Team Guy and a bunch of short stories.The first 5/6 of the show is the best thing ever.

It has, without a doubt, become of my favorite shows.

Different in that Rock Lee and crew(neji/tenten) are the main characters of this show, and instead of following the story, it's all about making jokes, gags, and crazy random stuff. Well me, being somewhat familiar with Naruto, I love it, and I don't know a show that would be better suited for this kind of thing.Art-8-----------I love animes that break the mold of what anime should look like(panty and stocking, tekkonkinkreet, and more i'm sure). This, while not being completely original, makes chibi art it's own,...and I find it fun to watch, beautiful, and extremely hilarious.

Naruto SD is a comical prin off from the Popular series Naruto Shippuden, but instead of Naruto being the main character Rock Lee is.

I just thought it kinda slow-pasted and a little boring at times.The art was amazing. very fitting for the anime. Character designs worked well because it was very lighthearted...and also the studio made the most important scenes have the prettiest colors.To include in this, I loved the music as well. The music is so different from most anime openings I listened to. The voice actors made the voices sound really good to.Now the characters were somewhat relatable, and because of that I loved the characters a lot.

We have a standard middle school club setting and barely any plot development to speak of; the show is simply about the everyday events the characters experience in their lives, and their interactions with each other. No more, no less. But with characters as interesting and likable as these, and some good...laughs to go with them, that\'s really all you need to still deliver a very funny and entertaining anime.The story mainly takes place inside a quite typical middle school art club room. What are not quite so typical though are its members. Uchimaki Subaru may be a very talented artist, but contrary to what you\'d maybe expect, he\'s not very interested in drawing apples, statues or landscapes. The only thing he\'s interested in drawing... is waifus. Perfect. Uchimaki is like a tongue-in-cheek representation of what people like to joke around that the average anime viewer is like. He\'s very devoted and serious when it comes to his waifu drawings, he claims to not be interested in 3D girls at all since they\'re impractical and ""incomparable to 2D greatness"", and he even gets into trouble with his schoolwork because he\'s too busy watching 30 episodes of seasonal anime every week. I\'m sure a lot of the viewers can relate to at least some of those things, and the ways Konobi sort of breaks the fourth wall time and time again is part of what makes it so amusing to watch.At the same time though, Uchimaki\'s world views are much to the dismay of his fellow club member Usami Mizuki, who doesn\'t have any interest in anime at all and thus finds his drawings to be in rather questionable taste. But at the same time she also finds out that he is a very kind and easily approachable guy on a personal level, and she just couldn\'t help but fall in love with him over time as a result... however since Uchimaki is only interested in his waifus rather than noisy 3D girls, she\'s in a pretty tough spot. A spot which Konobi also makes great use of to be a consistent source of really great comedy. Especially since Usami\'s feelings are clear as day to literally everyone other than Uchimaki, and they never stop making fun of her for it.Then there\'s the resident oddball duo consisting of Imari Maria and Collette (family name unknown). Maria is the only one whom Uchimaki can converse openly with about his interests, as she\'s the only other character in the show who\'s also into anime and manga. In a certain way she\'s even more hopeless because she\'s seemingly gotten quite a bit of chuuni fever from it as a result. Though unlike your typical chuuni girl, Maria doesn\'t really play her character straight but rather it\'s more like an occasional chuuni act she just pulls out because she thinks it\'s fun. She doesn\'t appear to be too delusional on the inside, but for some reason likes to act like she is. Collette on the other hand... where do I even start; this girl is borderline incomprehensible. Everything she does seems completely random and not properly thought through, like a little kid with way too big of an imagination. She also wants to be a super hero, so naturally seeing Maria\'s confident chuuni act was like finding the person she always wanted to be herself, and thus she wastes no time at all in asking to become her apprentice. And so we end up in a situation where a pretend-chuuni girl tries her best to teach an underclassman how to become a real one. You don\'t see that every day. There\'s also the (nameless) president of the art club in there but there\'s not a whole lot to say about him because his shtick is basically just to fall asleep wherever and whenever possible, and never actually contribute anything useful to the club.It\'s a very simplistic show at heart, mainly consisting of shorter skits (about 5-10 minutes each) and not much actual plot progression. But honestly it doesn\'t have to be anything more than it already is. Just seeing these characters live their daily lives and interacting with each other during it is more than enough to provide a solid anime, simply because of how likable all of them are and how good the comedy is. There are a lot of meta cultural references taking jabs at modern anime fans (all in good fun of course) as well as a lot of more traditional romcom elements that are used quite tastefully. I should probably mention though that any romance fans out there might be disappointed in hearing that there is almost no romantic progression between Uchimaki and Usami at all in this anime, but you only need to watch a few minutes of it to figure that out on your own. It was never going to happen because that\'s not actually what Konobi is about. It\'s an infatuation used solely for the sake of comedic effect, not feels. Poor Usami.It may be a very ""standard"" anime as a whole, with a common setting, normal animation quality and soundtrack usage, and no real plot progression to speak of. But the only thing an anime of this nature really needs in order to blossom is likable characters and generally good comedy, and that is exactly where Konobi\'s strengths lie.

I\'m a huge Chunibyou fan, and seeing the art was similar was pleasing.Story: 6It doesn\'t take much to draw a lot of Chuunibyou comparisons based on archetypes and character design.  However, even though there\'s a girl with Chuni in Kono B, it\'s story is its own and no where as serious or life-defining, but instead is much more about a girl with a crush on a guy who only digs anime chicks.It\'s very much ""adventure of the day"", with no intermixing...plot elements to bind the story, other than a girl crushing on a guy who likes waifus.In some anime, there is basically 0 plot development. This is one of them. Where you start is where you end. If you like that sort of thing, where no one gets too heavy and it\'s all in good fun, you might be a fan.I prefer a bit more of an unfolding story.Art: 10I love the Chuuni art style, and this copies it perfectly. In fact, a few of the characters could just be pallet swaps, to be honest. Still, this is my favorite type of color saturation / animation / art style. If you like softer and more colorful, this will do it for you. The last episodes animation is amazing.Sound. 7The opening score is kind of average. The end score is good but with weird visuals. The VA\'s are all great fits.Character. 6The teacher is cute. The boy is different. The main girl is crushing on the main boy. No one so far has any surprises or value other than whats on the surface. The more anime I watch, the more I prefer characters who are more than a trope. This so far is the shows only real shortcoming.-The president, a sleepy character who loves naps-Subaru, a love-oblivious kid who dislikes ""3-d"" women and spends his time drawing waifu.- Mizuki, a generic-on-purpose protagonist who loves Subaru, but is ignored by him.-Collete, a french student left behind by her parents. She\'s ""the weird one."" and basically Dekomori with a haircut.A little later on, a new cast member appears, who shares many interests with Subaru, which annoys the crap out of Mizuki. She\'s also got 8th Grade Syndrome, refers to the ""Black Flame Dragon"", and is basically a bridge of concept between this show and Chuunibyou.Sensei Yumeha is also a thing, but she\'s relegated to oppai fan-service.Enjoyment. 8It\'s a good ""smiling"" kind of a show and one you can enjoy. You -know- how most episodes will end, but it\'s nice to watch it happen and generally the things they try to make cute, are in fact very cute and it\'s pretty funny. I genuinely laugh about once or twice an episode.Overall. 7.4(Note, I weigh story and characters as double scores.)Art Class is an anime worth watching for some and will be incredibly frustrating for others.  The art is great even if the substance is thin, it\'s tropes we like watching over and over. It tries really hard to draw from other works, and ends up feeling like a weak copy.It\'s a good production value kind of show, but it\'s very predictable and really nothing new from any other anime that\'s slice of life with an unrequited romance.Pros and Cons++: If you like the Chuunibyou art, you\'ll like this art.+: Good for slice of life without a huge cast.+: If you like low-drama.+: Is generally pretty funny.- - : If you want something thought provoking, like Chuunibyou.- - -: If you are tired of tropes.- -: 0 plot progression. plot elements to bind the story, other than a girl crushing on a guy who likes waifus.In some anime, there is basically 0 plot development.

The difference is that shows described by the former are usually on the negative side, whereas shows described by the latter can still be a good watch; Konobi is the latter.Produced by studio feel (who’ve brought the likes of OreGairu and Kiss x Sis) comes “This Art Club has a Problem!”, a hilarious, lighthearted rom-com with emphasis on “com”; Seriously, this show is funny. Definitely one of the greatest strengths of this show is...that it knows how every other rom-com plays out and instead of trying to simply be another one, it adds a couple pivotal twists to the setup and focuses more on the comedy aspect, making this show a unique and refreshing rom-com yet still allowing itself to be held back by the limitations of its genre-type.Konobi follows the story of a cute middle schooler, Mizuki, and the exploits that follow as she pursues her die hard crush on Uchimaki Subaru. This is where the first pivotal twist comes into play. Subaru is a certified otaku, the only girls he’s interested in are what he calls, “2D girls”; yes, Subaru has 17+ waifus. No joke. The second twist is not so much a twist but a unique way of keeping things fresh, it’s the setting: an art club. The only reason Subaru is in the Art Club of his middle school is so that he has the means to paint his 2D waifus day after day. Now imagine the struggles that Mizuki is accompanied by when she tries to pursue her crush on a man who’s only interest is in anime and manga girls. It can only be hilarious, right? This twist to the genre and premise sets up a plethora of extremely funny gags that surprisingly, aren’t a hit and miss.The reason the gags aren’t a hit and miss because unlike many other comedy-centric shows, it doesn’t rely on slapstick/chibi humour or what I like to call, “reaction humour”; reaction humour is a show’s attempt to make the viewer laugh by having its characters react to something absurd in an overblown and eccentric fashion. The reason reaction humour is almost always a hit and miss is because since it’s unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, it literally either hits your funny bone or misses it. While Konobi does have humour like this, it is never solely reliant on it. Rather, Konobi constructs its gags around a specific physical or abstract object (e.g. ruining someone’s painting and covering it up), and the humour is pulled from the anticipation of how the characters will eventually interact, react, and deal with the object. The humour is not wholly “predictable”, but on some level you build an anticipation in your mind about the end result, and when the show either matches or subverts your expectation it’s funny regardless. The hilarity that ensues throughout the show is never consistently funny, there will always be a couple gags that may very well not entertain you, but for the most part the show’s humour is well above average in terms of consistency of quality. Whenever you have a show with an overabundance of jokes it is a given that some may turn out being predictable and occasionally seem lackluster.The romance element of the show is heavily downplayed, and rightfully so. Its consistent comedic and lighthearted nature wouldn’t dare allow for serious and touching scenes of romance. Every time it seems as if Mizuki is about to move from a platonic relationship with Subaru to a romantic one, it’s always just another setup to prey on and make light of Mizuki’s naive and earnest pursual of Subaru. Many of the show’s episodes are divided into 2 parts, with each part following the exploits of another character or another subplot; this division sometimes makes the show feel episodic but the events that happen always impact the characters and their surroundings, so there is a sense of continuity throughout the story. This division of episodes into comedic shorts greatly compliments the pacing as well, things never unnecessarily drag out and the viewer won’t ever feel bored through repetition.The characters are just… there, they all have their own contrasting personalities but they can still just be summed up in one liners, for the most part. This is perfectly fine, considering that the show never tries to be a super realistic revolutionary romance story, it’s just a gag show, so as long as the characters are likeable and funny, for all practical purposes they can be considered “good” characters.Studio Feel are really upping their animation game; this show has dazzling visuals. Just the first episode alone has this breathtaking scene where Subaru is drawing Mizuki in the art club room, with shimmering sunset light beaming through the window, enveloping the entirety of the comfy art room in a warm, cozy colour palette that is just captivating to gaze at. With subtle, meticulous and distinct dust particles drifting through the air in a carefree manner as well, studio Feel brought this show to life. With Konobi added to their resume and OreGairu Season 2’s scrupulous character animations, they’re well on their way to approaching Kyoto Animation level beauty.The voice acting is pretty standard as far as anime goes, but one thing that should be noted is that Ozawa Ari, the voice actor of our protagonist Mizuki, also voiced Sakura from the equally hilarious show Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Coincidentally enough, both shows are actually fairly similar in terms of plot, so if you liked Gekkan Shoujo I cannot recommend Konobi enough. The soundtrack for the most part is again, pretty standard, but there are a couple tracks that are surprisingly distinct and potent. They add a sense of emotion to all the scenes and make the whole experience just a little bit more enjoyable overall.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite the show not being anything spectacular, it is fairly memorable. I was entertained a lot, I laughed a lot, I found Mizuki cute a lot, and amongst other things I was able to leave this show satisfied with and happy overall. The gorgeous visuals, the surprisingly potent soundtrack and then strong voice acting left a reasonable impression on me as well.Overall: 5.5/10Again, the show does nothing spectacular, but with a couple amusing twists to the rom-com setup it allows for a solid and entertaining watch throughout. I’d recommend this to anyone into who likes both romance and comedy, but usually prefers the latter over the former. For similar titles, again, I’d recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.I hope this review was informative and helpful. that it knows how every other rom-com plays out and instead of trying to simply be another one, it adds a couple pivotal twists to the setup and focuses more on the comedy aspect, making this show a unique and refreshing rom-com yet still allowing itself to be held back by the limitations of its genre-type.Konobi follows the story of a cute middle schooler, Mizuki, and the exploits that follow as she pursues her die hard crush on Uchimaki Subaru. This is where the first pivotal twist comes into play. Subaru is a certified otaku, the only girls he’s interested in are what he calls, “2D girls”; yes, Subaru has 17+ waifus. No joke. The second twist is not so much a twist but a unique way of keeping things fresh, it’s the setting: an art club. The only reason Subaru is in the Art Club of his middle school is so that he has the means to paint his 2D waifus day after day. Now imagine the struggles that Mizuki is accompanied by when she tries to pursue her crush on a man who’s only interest is in anime and manga girls. It can only be hilarious, right? This twist to the genre and premise sets up a plethora of extremely funny gags that surprisingly, aren’t a hit and miss.The reason the gags aren’t a hit and miss because unlike many other comedy-centric shows, it doesn’t rely on slapstick/chibi humour or what I like to call, “reaction humour”; reaction humour is a show’s attempt to make the viewer laugh by having its characters react to something absurd in an overblown and eccentric fashion. The reason reaction humour is almost always a hit and miss is because since it’s unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, it literally either hits your funny bone or misses it. While Konobi does have humour like this, it is never solely reliant on it. Rather, Konobi constructs its gags around a specific physical or abstract object (e.g. ruining someone’s painting and covering it up), and the humour is pulled from the anticipation of how the characters will eventually interact, react, and deal with the object. The humour is not wholly “predictable”, but on some level you build an anticipation in your mind about the end result, and when the show either matches or subverts your expectation it’s funny regardless. The hilarity that ensues throughout the show is never consistently funny, there will always be a couple gags that may very well not entertain you, but for the most part the show’s humour is well above average in terms of consistency of quality. Whenever you have a show with an overabundance of jokes it is a given that some may turn out being predictable and occasionally seem lackluster.The romance element of the show is heavily downplayed, and rightfully so. Its consistent comedic and lighthearted nature wouldn’t dare allow for serious and touching scenes of romance. Every time it seems as if Mizuki is about to move from a platonic relationship with Subaru to a romantic one, it’s always just another setup to prey on and make light of Mizuki’s naive and earnest pursual of Subaru. Many of the show’s episodes are divided into 2 parts, with each part following the exploits of another character or another subplot; this division sometimes makes the show feel episodic but the events that happen always impact the characters and their surroundings, so there is a sense of continuity throughout the story. This division of episodes into comedic shorts greatly compliments the pacing as well, things never unnecessarily drag out and the viewer won’t ever feel bored through repetition.The characters are just… there, they all have their own contrasting personalities but they can still just be summed up in one liners, for the most part. This is perfectly fine, considering that the show never tries to be a super realistic revolutionary romance story, it’s just a gag show, so as long as the characters are likeable and funny, for all practical purposes they can be considered “good” characters.Studio Feel are really upping their animation game; this show has dazzling visuals. Just the first episode alone has this breathtaking scene where Subaru is drawing Mizuki in the art club room, with shimmering sunset light beaming through the window, enveloping the entirety of the comfy art room in a warm, cozy colour palette that is just captivating to gaze at. With subtle, meticulous and distinct dust particles drifting through the air in a carefree manner as well, studio Feel brought this show to life. With Konobi added to their resume and OreGairu Season 2’s scrupulous character animations, they’re well on their way to approaching Kyoto Animation level beauty.The voice acting is pretty standard as far as anime goes, but one thing that should be noted is that Ozawa Ari, the voice actor of our protagonist Mizuki, also voiced Sakura from the equally hilarious show Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Coincidentally enough, both shows are actually fairly similar in terms of plot, so if you liked Gekkan Shoujo I cannot recommend Konobi enough. The soundtrack for the most part is again, pretty standard, but there are a couple tracks that are surprisingly distinct and potent. They add a sense of emotion to all the scenes and make the whole experience just a little bit more enjoyable overall.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite the show not being anything spectacular, it is fairly memorable. I was entertained a lot, I laughed a lot, I found Mizuki cute a lot, and amongst other things I was able to leave this show satisfied with and happy overall. The gorgeous visuals, the surprisingly potent soundtrack and then strong voice acting left a reasonable impression on me as well.Overall: 5.5/10Again, the show does nothing spectacular, but with a couple amusing twists to the rom-com setup it allows for a solid and entertaining watch throughout.

So LA pose a question...is it funny?.Well before LA can answer that, LA needs to get to the technical first.In terms of characters, we got an eccentric bunch of characters, yes even the main girl Mizuki Usami voiced by Ari Ozawa who draws apples all the time and has a crush on the 2D anime waifu ""artist"" Subaru Uchimaki voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi, we also have Collette voiced by Sumire Uesaka...the underclassman and member of the art club who is the trickster chunni type, President voiced by Kentarou Tone, the ever sleepy and sleeping president of the art club and Yumeko Tachibana voiced by Nana Mizuki the new advisor of the art club. If there was a character that was LA\'s favourite it actually goes to the Nao Touyama character of Maria Imari, an eccentric chunni who knows she is a chunni but still is one and a sorta of love rival to Mizuki halfway through the anime. Maria for what a ""new character"" introduced halfway through, she quickly and smoothly integrates int the cast and has GREAT chemistry with Usami and Uchimaki.  Really since Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a character-situational comedy, the character stands to reason be the focus and brings out the comedy as well.Well on speaking of comedy, the comedy in Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is at best character-driven and because of it can be really subjective as to if you like it\'s humor or not. Do you like off-handed gags that brings out a characters motivation but as compensation have some of the gags be nothing but one off or have over exaggerated reactions, is the humor you\'re looking for more of a Chekhov\'s gun material where previous gags builds up to a bigger and better gag down the line, then this is the kind of comedy that you\'re in for. LA won\'t say that this comedy is FOR EVERYONE and laugh out loud, the anime\'s comedy at best got a couple of chuckles here and there from the characters reaction faces alone. Now LA won\'t say that Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!\'s comedy doesn\'t meet ALL of the criteria LA just said as the comedy have some smaller detailed comedic moments (like background off-handed situations to running gags from way previous episodes making surprising comeback comedic one-offs later) as well as Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!\'s best strengths is it\'s character chemistry with the main cast of the art club, really due to the characters chemistry with one another and bouncing off comedic moments and reacting in kind really makes the comedy shine for the better, thus LA can really overlook it\'s running gags as that is only the foundation for the comedic moments to work off of.Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! also has some sentimentality moments mainly with characters like Yumeko Tachibana trying to bring the art club together during the cultural festival, Moeka voiced by Aimi Tanaka with President in one episode and Usami for your romantic sentimentality in which YOU KNOW where it\'s going. The sentimentality is what counts even if straight after the heart-warming moment leads straight into a comedic one-liner etc.The only BIG issue with this is that since these eccentric characters have at best some lingering running gags to them (Mizuki\'s crush and tsundere act and apples, Subaru\'s cluelessness and 2D-waifu gags and Yumeko being a ditz and misunderstanding the situation to Collette and Maria\'s chunni misunderstandings). But LA already explained above how the repetitive running gags can be overlooked on how the situational comedy builds and work with the running gags instead of making it stale.In terms of animation by Studio feel. overall was presented with a nice and decent consistency as well as the poppy and vibrant character designs, even in the most comedic moments, they do resort of ""anime emoji faces"" but LA kinda sees that as kinda the point. Nonetheless the animation\'s overall ok consistency and atmospheric backgrounding makes the animation ok.In terms of voice acting, well for a rather manzai-form of comedy, most of the voice actors either are the ""boke"" (the moron) like Uchimaki, Collette and if you wanna add her Yumeko-sensei or tsukommi (wise guy) the most obvious one Usami and LA will give liberties to President as this as well. Maria is more or less BOTH of these all due to her chunni-personality being ramped up and her situational moments can BACKFIRE on her. Nonetheless from this LA\'s favourite voice actors goes to Ari Ozawa and Nao Touyama because of this. What LA found more a ""playing against the type"" character was Nana Mizuki as the shy-ditzy Yumeko-sensei as she usually voices the more ""badass with a tragic backstory"" type of character...it was just something LA noticed is why LA brought it up.Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! isn\'t quite the best comedy anime this season, it\'s at best slightly above average at best depending on the running gags or newer gags that were brought up. So LA posed a question to you at the start of this review, is this anime funny?...well if character chemistry, well-timed comedic skits and likable and eccentric characters does it for ya, then quite easily Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a good comedy to watch from Summer 2016, LA won\'t say it\'s the ""best"" as it depends on taste for comedy, comedy is subjective after all, but if you want a pure situational comedy from Summer 2016, then Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! is a perfect choice. the underclassman and member of the art club who is the trickster chunni type, President voiced by Kentarou Tone, the ever sleepy and sleeping president of the art club and Yumeko Tachibana voiced by Nana Mizuki the new advisor of the art club.

It's not too cheezy or too dramatic, the perfect mix for a romcom.At first glance, it may look like another moeblob comedy. Well, I can tell you with a straight face that it's not.

You may think it's a shoujo series, but it shows traits that even shounen comedy series would display, meaning it's made for both boys and girls.Another thing that I liked was the art style. As stated before,...it's all cute and adorable. But upon closer inspection, you can see how detailed the background props and animation was. In terms of art, this series tops any anime of this season. Of course, that's expected since the show is about an art club.To summarize, it was a great experience watching this anime.

I am going to tell you about the many bad things about this show and how i believe that this show doesn\'t deserve anything beyond a 5 overall.STORY: 2This show has absolutely no plot progression to speak of, it has the essence of a comedy skit anime but it tries to have the story line of a linear romcom. The show fumbles over how to progress with Subaru\'s artistic ability by showing him entering one art competition, and that\'s it. There isn\'t really anything else to say about...his unique part in the story. The story also shows Mizuki and her problems involving her love for Subaru, but like every other girl, she fails miserably. the only difference is that she actually lost to a damn anime girl. and that\'s the end of her part in all of this.

Nothing was weird or out of place and all of the voices were well done too.CHARACTER: 2 - No Character PersonalityThe only saving grace of any of these characters is that they are cute. especially Collette, other than that, they all fall into some sort of ultra generic trope. I also couldn\'t stand Mizuki\'s constant babbling and crying over how much of a clueless dumbass trope character Subaru is.Enjoyment: 1 - NonePersonally, i didn\'t derive any enjoyment out of this show. I actually consider myself to be a pretty mindless watcher.

The story revolves around the art club members but mainly focuses on Usa and Uchimaki. Throughout the show, we get to see Usami-chan's experience in having to deal with Uchimaki-kun's addiction, and don't worry, this story isn't that dark. This sets up a handful of hilarious scenes and minor plot twists that might squeeze out some air from your nostrils. The story doesn't do anything in particular with the school setting that would've changed the story drastically if it didn't take...place at school. The romance is sprinkled in here and there, but any real romantic developments are usually shot down with a one-liner from Cole-chan or anyone from the supporting cast.

(dat copy and paste doe) is just one of the many ordinary series that are just out there to make us laugh, and to enjoy the shit loan out of moe. It\'s basically a daily lives of high school student type of series, where you got this club that not so many people are interested in. And the students within the club ended up doing stuff that\'s fun, and carefree (in term of their freedom to choose what to do, what sorts of activities) despite just being a fucking ""art club"". And the centralization of focus are solely...concentrated on those clubs activities, and some external setting with its support/minor character in the story, to expand their gag for each episodes. And so far, this anime has been pretty entertaining, mainly, the fucking moe. Plus, there\'s this romance between our MC (who\'s dense af, just like any other Harem MC out fucking there....) and... I guess, the heroine of the story, Usami Mizuki. And so far, everything that\'s happening in this anime, or from what i see, is very generic. Although the things that\'re not so generic and cliche, or just too typical of an anime of this kind to do are.... comedy that this series are showing you. Well it\'s not really all that different from other of those typical ones.And if you\'re expecting a good story out of this, then let me tell you this. It\'s a fucking slice of life anime, you don\'t expect a story out of it. You should prolly expect cuteness, gag, chill and relax environment, etc. because that\'s just the priority in most of any slice of life shows. Although I haven\'t finished watching the anime just yet. I could clearly predicted that our MC and our Heroine will never get together and they will ended up stagnating their relationship, ending nowhere, and restart from the very fucking beginning. This shits happens alot in these kind of romance anime where they teases you with some romantic scene, but something tend to happen in order to not have the intended things (developing love, getting their love through the MC or something) to happen. Or else that would just be the end of the story. Or possibly, not the end, but the end of the overall gag of the series that revolves around Usami Mizuki\'s interaction of embarrassment; in order to gradually win our MC over and make love, or began their romance maybe.But overalll, this anime was pretty generic in term of setting, story, romance gag, dense MC, characters, the overly weird and illogical thoughts of a character to do a particular things, or actions that aimed to be cute (Take Collette for instance, or the female supervisor of the art club) and so on. But nonetheless, this anime is so god damn CUTE (or moe...) AF. But because i have seen several of these types of anime before, my enjoyment of the series are also being affected by that as well. However, it\'s still a funny anime to watch. Not for the story in particular, and maybe for the romance that would unlikely happen between our MC and heroine. But the moe gag should keep you on your seat, while watching the anime. Coz that\'s like the only thing about these kind of series that make anything out of their content amusing, or enjoyable to watch. Even though i did sometime skip some parts just because it\'s pretty repetitive, and boring at times. It\'s still an ok series to watch. Give it a go. concentrated on those clubs activities, and some external setting with its support/minor character in the story, to expand their gag for each episodes. And so far, this anime has been pretty entertaining, mainly, the fucking moe. Plus, there\'s this romance between our MC (who\'s dense af, just like any other Harem MC out fucking there....) and... I guess, the heroine of the story, Usami Mizuki. And so far, everything that\'s happening in this anime, or from what i see, is very generic. Although the things that\'re not so generic and cliche, or just too typical of an anime of this kind to do are.... comedy that this series are showing you. Well it\'s not really all that different from other of those typical ones.And if you\'re expecting a good story out of this, then let me tell you this. It\'s a fucking slice of life anime, you don\'t expect a story out of it. You should prolly expect cuteness, gag, chill and relax environment, etc. because that\'s just the priority in most of any slice of life shows. Although I haven\'t finished watching the anime just yet. I could clearly predicted that our MC and our Heroine will never get together and they will ended up stagnating their relationship, ending nowhere, and restart from the very fucking beginning. This shits happens alot in these kind of romance anime where they teases you with some romantic scene, but something tend to happen in order to not have the intended things (developing love, getting their love through the MC or something) to happen. Or else that would just be the end of the story. Or possibly, not the end, but the end of the overall gag of the series that revolves around Usami Mizuki\'s interaction of embarrassment; in order to gradually win our MC over and make love, or began their romance maybe.But overalll, this anime was pretty generic in term of setting, story, romance gag, dense MC, characters, the overly weird and illogical thoughts of a character to do a particular things, or actions that aimed to be cute (Take Collette for instance, or the female supervisor of the art club) and so on. But nonetheless, this anime is so god damn CUTE (or moe...) AF. But because i have seen several of these types of anime before, my enjoyment of the series are also being affected by that as well. However, it\'s still a funny anime to watch. Not for the story in particular, and maybe for the romance that would unlikely happen between our MC and heroine. But the moe gag should keep you on your seat, while watching the anime. Coz that\'s like the only thing about these kind of series that make anything out of their content amusing, or enjoyable to watch. Even though i did sometime skip some parts just because it\'s pretty repetitive, and boring at times. It\'s still an ok series to watch. Give it a go.', 'High school anime are a dime a dozen.  Whether it\'d be moe-related, a bunch of students in a club or whatnot doing stuff, or maybe even the dramatic story detailing a person\'s life, high school is the most overused setting for any given anime.  So, how do you make such an anime?  Well, throw in a couple of oddballs in a seemingly normal club and you\'ll get a basic setup for your standard average anime of this type.  Konobi is just another piece in the long art gallery of high school anime where it doesn\'t really give us anything new, but...damn is it entertaining.Story: Our story follows Usami Mizuki and her exploits in the art club.  After having its new member by the name of Uchimaki Subaru, she begins developing a crush on the boy and his superior art skills, only to find out that his only motivation for even participating is the fact that he wants a place in order to create the ""Perfect Waifu.""  Followed with their energetic and naive kouhai and their extremely lazy senpai, the title of ""The Art Club has a Problem"" is...pretty self-explanatory here.Being honest here, Konobi is really nothing special.  Lovestory sideplot that goes nowhere, episodic stories that more or less return the series\'s status quo every week with every new episode, cliche situations, everything is pretty standard and so tropey that there\'s really no way to actually describe other than generic.  They\'re all plotlines that\'ve been done before and as someone who\'s seen these stories before, they were all predictable and not really worth the time to ogle over in anticipation as to what would happen next.  So, what\'s really the intrigue here with Konobi?Well, in simple terms, it would be the way these situations are portrayed.  They\'re all pretty standard, yes, but the series plays with the straight man/funny man dynamic where practically everyone but Usami, our main protagonist, plays the strange/interesting person role while she throws out her own retorts.  Some of the character interactions are somewhat entertaining I admit, and the characters breathe a slightly different light into these generally bland and boring story concepts, thus giving them a slight different appearance to them, enough to be technically different, even if not really at its base level.So in the end, what is Konobi?  Konobi is a series that slathers a new coat of paint on what would be considered as boring and tired storylines, thus giving the show a different perspective with its straight/funny man style comedy as well as utilizing the art club gimmick heavily so that it doesn\'t just feel like a bunch of characters doing something that doesn\'t even relate to the title or synopsis of the series.  (Lookin\' at you, K-on.)  It\'s entertaining, but at the same time, but doesn\'t have enough to make the story interesting enough to be amazing or anything.Overview:+ Mildly entertaining+ New coat of paint on old tropes+ Uses the series\'s gimmick often-  Still more or less the same generic tropes-  Romantic subplot got tiringCharacters:  Slice of life needs interesting characters.  If there aren\'t interesting characters, than you have failed in making an good slice of life anime that separates itself from the hordes of clones with a different name to them.First there\'s Usami Mizuki, our main protagonist.  Mizuki...isn\'t actually all that interesting.  Her entire schtick in the series is to have a crush on Subaru while also hating him for his waifu loving tendencies and his overall detachment with the real world.  (Boy like that\'s not overdone.)  She\'s also got a bust complex, has low tolerance for random bullsh*t that happens around her, the usual.  While not really all that interesting in terms of character, her role in the series as the straight man comes into play a lot in the series usually retorting Subaru or the laziness of the club president.  As a result, she\'s usually the one creating the air of comedy or strange situation as the catalyst to a lot of events.  But aside from that, she really has nothing to actually explain her character.Then there\'s Uchimaki Subaru, the other main protagonist.  As mentioned before, his reason for even being a part of this series is because he wants to be able to draw the \'perfect waifu\'.  As an otaku-type character with detachment from the \'real world\' and focusing solely on fictional women and their traits that make them cute, Subaru...really isn\'t all that interesting either.  Really, the main characters are probably the least interesting characters in this entire series.  His antics get Mizuki mad, and then creates the majority of conflict within the series whether they\'d be major or not.  Most of the runtime is devoted to Mizuki\'s crush on Subaru and really, with uninspiring characters, there\'s really nothing to actually talk about with them in particular.Now for the more fun ones.  The art club president (whose name escapes me), Colette, Isami, and various other side characters like Moeka make up the rest of the cast and aid in making this show actually seem worthwhile and interesting to watch.  You have the lazy moocher, the bombastic and energetic confused naive kouhai, the chuuni, and the 5 year old who wanders away from her parents so much that she needs to literally be tied to her mother to make sure she doesn\'t get lost.  Without these characters, Konobi would\'ve been bland and boring, and the kinds of color that they add to the series made it all more worthwhile.  Hell, they had an entire episode near the end of the series devoted to pretty much just the 5 year old and the club president, and goddamn is it probably the best episode in this entire series.Overview:+ Interesting side characters-  Kind of boring main charactersArt: Well, if a show about the art club doesn\'t have good art, it\'s a crime, right?  Well, I suppose it would be, but Konobi really doesn\'t suffer much in terms of art for a hilarious twist of irony.  (sadly)  Though to be fair, the show\'s naturally bright and colorful atmosphere and style does suit the light-hearted art-related series about character interactions and the spring of young love.  Of course, while the art does look good, it\'s not that stellar in the way that I would give it a high rating (like every other one of feel\'s work), but hey, it\'s better than crappy animation.One easter egg that I would like to address is the fact that all of Subaru\'s artworks in the series (since well, he does need to make art due to the theme of the series) are references to other girls in other series\'.  So if you see a drawing that seems familiar, chances are it\'s probably a reference.Overview:+ Fun references+/- Good, but average artstyleSound:  Sound...isn\'t really that much of a plus in Konobi.  The OP ""Starting Now"" is probably the most noticeable and memorable of all of the tracks due to its rock sound and kind of addicting chorus, but aside from that, the rest of the tracks really aren\'t up to its standard.The voice acting is also kind of average, so I wouldn\'t put much faith into this series being the best in the sound department.Overview:+ Pretty memorable OP-  Average in all other aspectsPersonal Enjoyment:  So what is Konobi?  What did I think of it?  Well, in simple terms, it was enjoyable.  It had enough to it to make me want to watch episode after episode despite its seemingly ordinary story setup and I genuinely liked some of the characters that they had, even if they were only side characters.  Of course, there was always room for improvement, but this was probably the best that you could probably make with a series of this genre.Did I like this series?Yes I did.  I especially liked the character \'Moeka\', the 5 year old with grown-up tastes.  She\'s cute, she was interesting, and she was definitely not one of those annoying kid characters that you would want to punch for being a crybaby.What didn\'t I like about this series?I really didn\'t appreciate how the main characters were so plain and unoriginal.  Personally, I think it\'s a mistake to make the side characters more unique and/or interesting than the main characters.  Sure the side characters got their time in the spotlight to make them shine a bit more, but when your side character focused episodes are more interesting than those that follow just the main two cast members, you\'re doing something TERRIBLY wrong here.Would I recommend this show?Konobi is special enough to be considered different from the rest of the dime a dozen high school romcom/slice of life episodic shows that plague the anime seasons year after year.  For that reason, I\'d say if you\'re looking for something like that, than this is the show that you should be watching.  If not, than don\'t bother.  There\'s nothing stellar about it aside from being mildly entertaining enough to garner enough interest to continue watching.  Aside from that, it\'s a pretty average show with not much else aside from its gimmick to hold itself afloat. damn is it entertaining.Story: Our story follows Usami Mizuki and her exploits in the art club.

The main character of the show stands out to be a 2d lover but the female character likes him tbh she tries hard to make him fall for him this situations turn out to be worth watching especially her cute blushes and comedy scenes,the background characters especially kaori and collete is too nice and to fill the mix a clumsy sensei and a crazy club prez. so from my point of view this backs upto be nicetime killer if you...are bored with the usual rom coms and the regular shounens. are bored with the usual rom coms and the regular shounens.', ""My score was a solid 7.6, which I have rounded off to an 8 without much hesitation.Konobi offers what most romcoms do, but with consistent art and characters which actually DON'T irritate one to the core.Characters: 9In romcoms, I usually dislike the female lead, because she tends to be too over the top, or 'moe' or cutesy. Or the animators do her injustices by trying to bring our her 'physical attributes', which I as a female viewer dislike.However, Konobi's Usami Mizuki is an absolute sweetheart, and you can't help but want to hug her in sympathy of her hopeless situation. She remains strong and witty,...while the whole time displaying the weaknesses of a girl in love. She is the backbone of the show.Uchimaki Subaru is adorable, and although an incredible pain in the side where Usami is concerned, I fully understand why she is so enamored by him. He's a very well-written character, showing a young 13-14 year old boy, and, apart from his 2D obsession, is your classic young middle schooler, with mood swings and backhanded comments and opinions.And it doesn't lose out on its side characters either. Apart from the other members of the club, I found Usami's friends to be absolutely endearing. They largely exist to tease her, but they do it in that gentle way friends do, and I loved having them around.So yes, characters are easily this show's strong point, as not one was irritating, down to little random Moeka on the streets.Art: 8Another thing I'd like to mention was the art. It was consistent, unlike shows where the nose is suddenly disproportionate to the face randomly in episode 7. No, throughout, the show was visually appetizing and you could see the care with which the creators animated this.Applause!Overall: 8I binge watched this over a span of a day, and my only regret is that it is over. May we see many more wonderful shows like Konobi, where characters, which are indeed the life of the show, are given justice. while the whole time displaying the weaknesses of a girl in love.

The biggest reason why I wanted to watch this rather obscure 2016 anime that no one seems to talk about is because of the main character, Usami Mizuki. When I saw her in a trailer on Anichart, for some reason I just fell in love with how adorable she looked. So of course, we come to this point.As I expected from Kono Bijutsubu Ni Wa Mondai Ga Aru, it ended up being a casual anime series, meaning that there isn't an overarching story with a lot of dramatic tension. The setting for this is an art club with...members that are a bit weird (as you might have guessed from the title). And I will give praise to this anime for actually taking some effort in focusing on attributes related to art and I can say that I did learn a thing or two from it. However, that is not to say that they did a very good job with it. The anime does not go into great detail about the aspects of art, as there is so much more than could be incorporated. But to compensate for that, the anime has the main theme of romance in play.A huge part of this anime focuses on the main character, Mizuki's constant attempts at grabbing the attention of her crush, Uchimaki Subaru. And let me just say that the fact that Mizuki is the main character of this anime itself is a huge bonus for me. She is without question my favourite character in the anime. And seeing her never ending pursuit for love was just such an adorable and enjoyable thing to watch. Say what you will about her inconfidence to Just Do It, I personally prefer it if the girls are a bit shy. So all in all, I would say that that is the best thing in the entire anime.Now to make a short comment about the side characters. While I appreciate that Mizuki is the main character, I kinda wished that the side characters were given a bit more focus. This is especially true for Mizuki's friends and Imari Maria. We hardly know anything about these characters and it would have been nice to know more about them. Although, I will say that I am really glad that the side characters are all so supportive of Mizuki in achieving her goal. It just made things so much more cheerful and I love that.Now, because this is a casual anime series, I would have to address more than just the romance. When it comes to the comedy, I can clearly say that it is not the best I have seen. Many jokes and funny scenes feel very cliche and generic. And sometimes when they try to set up a supposedly cool joke, I find them to be highly predictable (which in most cases, I was right about the outcomes) and in the end, they just turn out to be rather disappointing in my opinion. There are a few creative jokes here and there but it just didn't feel enough.The animation is done by Feel and I would have to say that it was alright but because nothing much goes on in the anime, there really isn't anything that truly stood out in my opinion. But at least it was nice that the anime has a rather cheerful colour scheme that made it nice to look at. This is art after all.And as for the theme songs. Let me first comment. Is it just a coincidence that Mizuki Nana sang the opening when we have a character named Mizuki in the anime or was that intentional? Well in any case, because she sang the opening, it was nice to listen to. Although I can definitely say that is not my favourite song by her. For the ending theme, it was an ok song but I really didn't think too much about it.In summary, while I'd definitely say that I still really enjoyed watching this anime. It felt like it went pass too quickly. It didn't really bring anything new in terms of comedy and there are so many things left that could be explored. Like I said, I really wished the side characters were given more attention. So in all honesty, I really hope that there will be a 2nd season for this anime. I have a feeling it seems very unlikely because of how little attention was given to this anime. But if Feel can focus on just the right things, a 2nd season would do this anime quite some good. Plus, I just want to see more of Mizuki anyway, so of course I would really love to see a sequel. Let's hope for the best. members that are a bit weird (as you might have guessed from the title).

Spoilers ahead!)Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! brings me back to when I was a teenager.In middle school, I enrolled in an art class. I was (and still am) not an artist, and I had no huge drive to become one. So, I mainly saw the class as a free period or at least one where I didn’t have to worry about much at all.Despite my low motivation, I learned a lot. Colors, shading, and perspective. I distinctly remember creating a two-faced jar and a rolled-up tube of toothpaste. Both were made from clay (then...painted), and both were placed on the shelf in the basement for family and guests to see.Konobi does not teach its audience anything about art on an educational level, but it certainly knows how to get its audience laughing.STORYKonobi centers on an art club filled with a handful of kooky characters. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, and President (the senior without a name) are normal students like everybody else at their middle school. However, and as the title implies, they encounter random problems on the regular, putting them in silly, everyday situations.This anime is like a multicolored can of paint. It contains one part slice-of-life, one part romance, and one part comedy. All mixed together into a colorful concoction that works on most blank canvases.The blue slice-of-life takes on a mini-story format. Each episode contains two or three small stories that target mundane situations. Losing an item, getting locked in a storage room, and trying to clean a pool are not exactly exciting, but they give the cast the opportunity to explore the simpler side of life. Almost as if each tiny arc is a new drawing that the show creates and the audience beholds.From the list above, a key factor is missing: art. Like many anime of this type, art is not the point but rather the glue that holds it all together. Yes, they make a sculpture or participate in competitions, but the bonding that they share is infinitely more important than the brush techniques they are using.It should be noted that the anime has an ever-so-slight focus on sexual material. Tachibana-sensei attempting to put on a tight maid outfit or Uchimaki pointing out that he can see Usami’s panties for the hundredth time are funny in the moment. But, in hindsight, these instances do not fit well with the anime’s friendly, everyday tone (let alone that the setting is literally a middle school).The red romance seeps into most of the gaps. Due almost entirely to Usami, her mega crush on Uchimaki drives much of the anime’s direction. From the small, endearing jig she does after getting his number or threatening President with deletion should he delete said number from her phone, most of the situations, in some form, relate back to the romantic tones.Unfortunately, “romance” may be too strong of a word, for what the anime shows is more akin to “extreme teasing” or “ultimately nothing” than the lovey-dovey gushing the audience wants.Usami more than brings the romance; it’s Uchimaki who is the problem. He does not just misunderstand Usami but rather actively turns her down. He will wave off her thoughts with a “Just kidding!” or constantly remind everyone that he only likes two-dimensional girls. His utter lack of interest ruins many of the scenes in a frustrating manner, leaving the audience to roll their eyes as Usami (inevitably) fails to get across her feelings.The yellow comedy arguably stands as the foundation of the entire anime. The jokes it delivers are not necessarily clever, but they can be subtle, rewarding its audience with small fits of laughter should they pick up on the references to earlier episodes or the actions taken by the cast. When Uchimaki points out that Tachibana is passed out on the floor again or when Usami’s arm is raised into the scene before the punchline hits, Konobi allows for simple yet effective jokes to thrive throughout its run.Subtlety isn’t its only comedic brand, but that’s both a blessing and a curse. Straightforward funnies, such as when the manga clerk puts on a smile and says to herself that she wants Usami, Imari, and Uchimaki to leave because they are causing a ruckus, are easily funny. Same goes for its visual gags: a red punch mark imprinted on Uchimaki’s cheek, President slowly losing his sanity with cleaning pop cans. And again with its on-the-spot humor such as when Usami and Uchimaki never recognize the overly competitive student who challenges Uchimaki to contests.But when the anime constantly relies on the say-it-will-not-happen-but-it-happens-anyway shtick or the he-said-something-weird-so-let-me-tell-him-it-is-weird formula, the anime devolves into a series of same-y jokes that keep the characters from being as comedically creative as the art they produce.Altogether, Konobi’s paint is not the most appealing in the world, but it forms enough fun to make it worth using on the walls of any clubroom.ANIMATIONArguably, Konobi’s best quality is the art and animation it so regularly uses.Although, to start out, it should be noted that the settings itself is plain. It’s in a school and, worse still, it primarily takes place in the same location – the art club – almost the entire time. However, what it lacks in background variety it makes up for in artistic appeal.Look back at episode three. When Collette is first introduced, and she enlists Uchimaki’s help to find her locket (“the kind that can’t fly”), she eventually stops to inspect a poster. To get Collette’s attention, he tugs on her arm. But he does so off camera, so the shot shows only Collette’s slight jostle.That honestly does not seem like much, but this nuanced movement highlights how much care the animation is given. I.e., since the art is “immobile,” many more resources are spent on the characters and their mobility. Scenes like Usami running up steps to meet Uchimaki on a bridge are noticeably fluid, and such scenes are seen at different points throughout the season.The anime also includes many reactions from the characters. Round eyes, triangular mouths, and tons of blushing elevate its comedy to an even greater degree. Often times, these reactions are coupled with colorful or more artsy backgrounds that play along with the fun and the art motif, subsequently boosting the comedy yet again.As for the characters’ designs, they are not as impressive as the animation or the colorful, comedic art. But they do have their merits.Usami’s bob-cut hairdo and bunny hair clip gives her a tomboy look while accentuating her girly behavior. Collette’s long, blonde hair contrasts well with her green eyes, her bit of hair that stands up gives her a silly, childlike look, and her short stature adds to her cuteness levels. And President’s ragged hair, loose-and-white button-up shirt, and propensity for wearing no shoes highlight his laziness to the max.CHARACTERSKonobi fails in one major regard: varying up the character scenes.The cast contains six different people. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, Imari, President, and Tachibana-sensei. Technically, more characters exist throughout the season, but these six are undoubtedly the main ones focused on.However, as the opening sentence declares, the anime does not do enough to populate its scenes with different pairings. Most notably, the whole group hardly ever do anything together. As the season progresses, Collette and President appear less and less. And Tachibana-sensei and Imari, who arrived a quarter of the way and halfway through the season respectively, barely get any screen time once their introductory episodes conclude.That’s not to say that the characters themselves do not have their relationships in place. Tachibana-sensei is harsh on Collette, President always comes very close to revealing Usami’s feelings for Uchimaki, Imari becomes Collete’s “master,” President has a thing for Tachibana-sensei, and Usami (obviously) loves Uchimaki. But, for whatever reason, Konobi does not like to experiment with other and multiple pairings, sticking instead with the ones it already has.On an individual scale, the characters have their roles and their types, allowing the slice-of-life, romance, and comedy to prosper when necessary.Usami gets extremely flustered when she deals with Uchimaki or people tease her about her feelings. But she also is not afraid to get overly violent should somebody (usually President) happen to annoy her. Her friends (especially Kaori) support her in her doomed quest, and she never gives up, even when her name is on the line.Uchimaki cares only for two-dimensional girls, believing that three-dimensional ones are a nuisance unworthy of his attention. He can also draw and paint quite well, and he has a subtle kindness to him that isn’t immediately apparent.Collette hails from America, and she is about as goofy as possible. Doing magic tricks, wearing bird heads, and believing in justice, this recent elementary-school graduate only sees the happier side to life no matter what she may be doing.President takes his sleeping seriously, making sure to use the club room’s couch (and their own funds) to his advantage to catch a wink. While he rarely participates in club activities, and he may seem unreliable, he looks out for the others whenever possible.Tachibana-sensei always has her heart in the right place. She practices her motivational phrases, awards fancy marks as positive reinforcement (even if they happen to ruin Uchimaki’s painting), and she encourages the club in their endeavors. She has a strict side, but her cute behavior (intentional or not) wins over most people that she meets.Imari is a girl who, like Uchimaki, loves manga and all-things two-dimensional. She has chuunibyou tendencies, believing that her arm contains a demonic power that she must control. Usami sees Imarii as a threat to her (Usami’s) own feelings for Uchimaki at first, but, as she gets to know more about Imari’s athleticism and ability to listen to others, it becomes apparent that Imari is less a rival and more a friend.Like the story, almost none of the characters here deal much with art. However, and sticking with themes, they each have a “problem” all their own. “Problems” which the audience can clean from their base characteristics. Usami obsesses over Uchimaki. Uchimaki pines after two-dimensional girls. Collette acts like a child. President is way too lazy. Tachibana-sensei cannot speak properly. And Imari plays out her imaginative thoughts.Since the anime is a romantic-comedy, these “problems” are never addressed as fixable ones. But that’s okay. They are what give the characters and the show in general the foundation to present its content, so one should not expect them to change much at all throughout the season.SOUNDKonobi’s musical offerings are once again like the rest of its qualities. That is, while nothing manages to be super impressive, it contains certain pieces here and there that stick out in a positive way.For instance, the tiny transition piece that plays when one scene switches to another is this quick, dropping sound that adds a bit of charm to the show. Same goes for the transition piece between the mini-stories. A simple set of piano notes that skip happily along make the switch comforting rather than jarring.The smaller sound-effects, like the rattling that Usami does when questioned about her romantic feelings for Uchimaki, continue to up the playfulness of the show and add to it even more comedy chops.Voice acting also has its moments. Sumire Uesaka as Collette achieves silliness with ease, especially when she makes her own sound-effects for teleporting-locket magic tricks. Ari Ozawa as Usami speaks cutely whenever she blushes (which happens all the time). And veteran Nana Mizuki as Tachibana-sensei uses a younger, more girly voice that fits the novice teacher well.The original soundtrack goes with lots of piano, flutes, and wooden instruments to up its lighthearted atmosphere. Stepping drums, clapping beats, and extra chimes add variety to the OST while continuing with the slice-of-life feel it aims for. Plus, the handful of insert songs, like when the club cleans the pool or as the final, closing track in episode twelve, prove Konobi’s attention to its music.The opening track relies mostly on guitar and drums for its first half, but, as the song progresses, the distorted sounds, background vocals, and fast-paced instruments craft the piece into a livelier one that starts each episode off with fun in mind. At the minimum, the chanting “Hey!” and beat itself are catchy enough to follow along with.The ending track goes a little weird. The instruments and sounds are simultaneously all over the place and organized, giving it a semi-chaotic composition that, in a way, comes off as artsy. Techno drums, faint background vocals, and off-kilter notes make this direction even more apparent. The singing itself is normal, but it contrasts with the weirdness, making said weirdness that much more noticeable.ENJOYMENTThis anime is one of those shows that just goes forgotten among the more unique, popular, or truly awful within its season. I almost never see anyone else talk about this anime in the community since it has aired – and I think that’s a shame.But I can understand why. From the analysis above, it’s pretty clear that the show does not do anything amazing, and it does not do anything horrible. It just coasts along the middle ground for nearly its entire run.On a personal level, I see a similar yet different outcome. None of the characters are memorable, but Collette’s carefree quirkiness, Usami’s immense cuteness, and Tachibana-sensei’s good spiritedness were a ton of fun throughout the season.Many of the mini-stories also had me laughing out loud. President and Uchimaki ruining Usami’s picture with red paint. Collette’s locket situation. The “treasure” they find and subsequently try to hide. These scenes and more had me in high spirits for most of its run.And, for those that know me, they know that I am huge on romance. It’s my favorite genre, after all. So, when I say that I loved the romantic moments involving Usami, I mean it. Uchimaki visiting her house to give Usami her printouts, the indirect kiss with the drinks, and when they got locked up in the storage room got me smiling wide and “Aww!”-ing hard.My favorite romance moment, though, was the classic dinner-bath-or-something-else scene. Seeing them as a married couple in Usami’s imagination, catching the reference to Usami’s apple painting hanging on the wall, and watching Usami steam up the room due to having these thoughts made for a wonderful romantic-comedy scene.I was really hoping, hoping beyond hope, that Uchimaki was playing the long con. That his constant pushback and persona was just a façade to get him closer to Usami. And that, by the end, the show would pull the reverse-reverse and make it Usami herself that he had fallen for. That would have been awesome as a joke and to give me the ultimate romance payoff.Alas, it was not meant to be. Yes, we got the ending exchange between the two where, for maybe a second, he reconsiders his thoughts on three-dimensional girls and Usami. But that was not enough in my eyes.Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! may not be on the forefront of everyone’s mind, but it stands solid nonetheless. Its subtle jokes, attention to animated detail, and a penchant for romance justify this mindset. While the characters and the content itself may ultimately be too plain, it no doubt gets higher marks than a rolled-up toothpaste project.SUMMARYStory: Fine, a colorful mixture of slice-of-life, romance, and comedy that is worthy of being on the walls of any clubroomAnimation: Good, fluid animation techniques, hilarious reactions, and some thoughtful character designs keep the visuals looking strongCharacters: Fine, Usami, Uchimaki, and the others each have their “problems” that form the foundation for the romantic-comedy direction takenSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, good OST, and good VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, while Usami and Uchimaki’s relationship goes nowhere, the characters were silly, the comedy was fun, and the romantic moments were awesomeFinal Score: 6/10 painted), and both were placed on the shelf in the basement for family and guests to see.Konobi does not teach its audience anything about art on an educational level, but it certainly knows how to get its audience laughing.STORYKonobi centers on an art club filled with a handful of kooky characters. Usami, Uchimaki, Collette, and President (the senior without a name) are normal students like everybody else at their middle school. However, and as the title implies, they encounter random problems on the regular, putting them in silly, everyday situations.This anime is like a multicolored can of paint. It contains one part slice-of-life, one part romance, and one part comedy. All mixed together into a colorful concoction that works on most blank canvases.The blue slice-of-life takes on a mini-story format. Each episode contains two or three small stories that target mundane situations. Losing an item, getting locked in a storage room, and trying to clean a pool are not exactly exciting, but they give the cast the opportunity to explore the simpler side of life. Almost as if each tiny arc is a new drawing that the show creates and the audience beholds.From the list above, a key factor is missing: art. Like many anime of this type, art is not the point but rather the glue that holds it all together. Yes, they make a sculpture or participate in competitions, but the bonding that they share is infinitely more important than the brush techniques they are using.It should be noted that the anime has an ever-so-slight focus on sexual material. Tachibana-sensei attempting to put on a tight maid outfit or Uchimaki pointing out that he can see Usami’s panties for the hundredth time are funny in the moment. But, in hindsight, these instances do not fit well with the anime’s friendly, everyday tone (let alone that the setting is literally a middle school).The red romance seeps into most of the gaps. Due almost entirely to Usami, her mega crush on Uchimaki drives much of the anime’s direction. From the small, endearing jig she does after getting his number or threatening President with deletion should he delete said number from her phone, most of the situations, in some form, relate back to the romantic tones.Unfortunately, “romance” may be too strong of a word, for what the anime shows is more akin to “extreme teasing” or “ultimately nothing” than the lovey-dovey gushing the audience wants.Usami more than brings the romance; it’s Uchimaki who is the problem.

It literally explores art club problems (as the title promises).CHARACTERS:• Usami-chan - She is mature, Tsundere, gets easily jealous, and loves Uchimaki but she denies it in public.• Uchimaki-san - He is an OTAKU! Draws 2D girls and calls them Waifu and is a very talented artist.• President - His real name wasn't mentioned in the show. He is a 3rd year student who is lazy & just sleeps in the club room.OVERALL: Theme song is catchy. It inspires me to do more art & join their art club. I still...pray every week that Uchimaki will draw something else that IS NOT a WAIFU! pray every week that Uchimaki will draw something else that IS NOT a WAIFU!"", 'Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! (This Art Club Has A Problem!)Art/Characters: Before anything else, I need to say how much I love the opening animation to this show. It shows the basic steps to drawing a character and making it come to life, and the characters are the main ones in the show. It’s a play on images! I think that is just so much fun and then it shows well how they all interact together and all of the confusion that the show promises is available to see in the opening animation. As for the art of the show as a whole...I felt that it was fresh and not too generic, as it could have easily been. It had a shine to it that is unlike anything I have really seen at all in this season. But just because it is fresh doesn’t mean there aren’t anime clichés. The twin tails girl, the awkward adviser, and one of the main characters having a messy hair style, either way it still felt good and original. As for the characters themselves, I have seen them before, but their character style isn’t overused. The main girl is hopelessly in love with main guy but the main guy doesn’t seem to notice. Uchimaki is just focused on his 2D anime wife. The club president is actually a new character I haven’t really seen, he seems to take on the role of “person most likely to nap through school”. As for Colette, her most interesting trait is that she doesn’t have dialogue until a few episodes in, but can be seen hiding in episode 1.Sound/Music: The music! The Music! THE MUSIC of this show is so catchy and so poppy and so fun and so enjoyable that I would pay to own the soundtrack. The bubbly and the synth music just go so well together that I can’t get over it. This is the type of background music that compliments the show so well, that it actually gives the show depth. The actual sound direction however, is a little lax. There was the occasional crash when something fell, or the door sliding open, but what would have really pulled me in, would be when the closeness of the camera was on the canvas, and you would be able to hear the paint brush sweep across creating a new dynamic. It would have been nice, but it didn’t happen. However, I must say that the music that replaced that sound, more than compensated and I was happy anyway.Story: This is the story of how Usami is trying to win the love of her life, Uchimaki. But he is not interested in 3D girls, and he is only focused on the wives that he paints and the ones he watches in anime. While she is trying to win him over, she is surrounded by Colette, a troublemaker that seems to only want to goof off, and the club president, who really only wants to sleep through club activities. Between, trying to win his love and being surrounded by people who don’t seem to care, Usami really just wants to use the club time to paint and express herself with what she deems as “True art”, aka. not anime girls.Personal Reflection: This is one of those shows that I saw the art, I saw the title, and instantly fell in love. I am such a sucker for club-based anime, and I am proud of that. This show, as I have said before, has amazing music and it is honestly one of the best parts of this show. But that alongside a hilarious pairing of a studious girl with an otaku boy, the show really blossoms into something special. There is even another character that comes around who wants to impress Usami and no matter what he does, he can’t seem to get it right, which I think is quite playfully fun and I actually feel a little bad for him. As I hinted before, the opening is so good and so clever when it comes to the way it ties the show together. I have often said that a good opening is better than a PV in many ways. The PV is supposed to give a taste of the art, the animation, and maybe the voice acting, but an opening is supposed to showcase what the characters are supposed to be like, and this opening is the crown jewel if I have ever seen one. As for the rest of the show, it is fantastic. It is funny, it pushes limits, and it is really smart. The one thing I didn’t like was that there didn’t seem to be much progression. I won’t spoil the ending, but I do think it is important to have progression through the entire show, but on the other hand, to not have any, and then have the final episode go to fast, can really kill a show for me, and I am glad that the show didn’t take the latter route. The show that is before you has a fresh and enjoyable art style, with clever humor, amazing music, and is only a little cliché; check it out if you love Club-based anime!Overall Score: 8.5/10 I felt that it was fresh and not too generic, as it could have easily been. It had a shine to it that is unlike anything I have really seen at all in this season. But just because it is fresh doesn’t mean there aren’t anime clichés. The twin tails girl, the awkward adviser, and one of the main characters having a messy hair style, either way it still felt good and original. As for the characters themselves, I have seen them before, but their character style isn’t overused. The main girl is hopelessly in love with main guy but the main guy doesn’t seem to notice. Uchimaki is just focused on his 2D anime wife. The club president is actually a new character I haven’t really seen, he seems to take on the role of “person most likely to nap through school”. As for Colette, her most interesting trait is that she doesn’t have dialogue until a few episodes in, but can be seen hiding in episode 1.Sound/Music: The music! The Music! THE MUSIC of this show is so catchy and so poppy and so fun and so enjoyable that I would pay to own the soundtrack. The bubbly and the synth music just go so well together that I can’t get over it. This is the type of background music that compliments the show so well, that it actually gives the show depth. The actual sound direction however, is a little lax. There was the occasional crash when something fell, or the door sliding open, but what would have really pulled me in, would be when the closeness of the camera was on the canvas, and you would be able to hear the paint brush sweep across creating a new dynamic. It would have been nice, but it didn’t happen. However, I must say that the music that replaced that sound, more than compensated and I was happy anyway.Story: This is the story of how Usami is trying to win the love of her life, Uchimaki. But he is not interested in 3D girls, and he is only focused on the wives that he paints and the ones he watches in anime. While she is trying to win him over, she is surrounded by Colette, a troublemaker that seems to only want to goof off, and the club president, who really only wants to sleep through club activities. Between, trying to win his love and being surrounded by people who don’t seem to care, Usami really just wants to use the club time to paint and express herself with what she deems as “True art”, aka. not anime girls.Personal Reflection: This is one of those shows that I saw the art, I saw the title, and instantly fell in love. I am such a sucker for club-based anime, and I am proud of that. This show, as I have said before, has amazing music and it is honestly one of the best parts of this show. But that alongside a hilarious pairing of a studious girl with an otaku boy, the show really blossoms into something special. There is even another character that comes around who wants to impress Usami and no matter what he does, he can’t seem to get it right, which I think is quite playfully fun and I actually feel a little bad for him. As I hinted before, the opening is so good and so clever when it comes to the way it ties the show together. I have often said that a good opening is better than a PV in many ways. The PV is supposed to give a taste of the art, the animation, and maybe the voice acting, but an opening is supposed to showcase what the characters are supposed to be like, and this opening is the crown jewel if I have ever seen one. As for the rest of the show, it is fantastic. It is funny, it pushes limits, and it is really smart. The one thing I didn’t like was that there didn’t seem to be much progression. I won’t spoil the ending, but I do think it is important to have progression through the entire show, but on the other hand, to not have any, and then have the final episode go to fast, can really kill a show for me, and I am glad that the show didn’t take the latter route. The show that is before you has a fresh and enjoyable art style, with clever humor, amazing music, and is only a little cliché; check it out if you love Club-based anime!Overall Score: 8.5/10', 'This was really good. This is not the worst anime in the world but it did it job. It is different from a lot of school life anime, and I liked it because of it.Story: Now for the story their is not too much to it. You have this art club full of students with all different personalities. every episode is it own different story that is it own episode. For that reason I give the story a 6, not too much to it (other than the unrequited love between the characters).Art: The art in this i fantastic, Involving around an art club...you would expect a very great art quality, and I was not disappointed. The art I give a 9.Sound: For the sound I watched it sub (which at the time of this review, it the only version available). The sub is not that bad although when is a sub ever bad. The sound I give a 7.Characters: Now I have a lot to say about the characters. First off usually in a school life anime the characters are in high school, that is not the case this time because they are in middle school students. Now this might turn some people off to this anime because the characters are going to really not be grown up yet. This really interested me going in because for most slice of life fans you are consisted in a high school environment, and not a middle school environment.  The characters I give a 10.Enjoyment/Overall: The enjoyment value I give a 7, I was enjoying this though I thought this would be easy to binge watch but it did not go through.

It uses tropes like any other anime, since that´s pretty much unavoidable, but it is a show that definitely shows it is trying it´s best in spite of a couple fatal flaws in the set up.On the good points side, the show has stunning art. If it wasn´t for the general lack of more fluid art which at the same time has bigger detail, it would have a full 10. However, this is a big nitpick, and between it´s focus on art and the general unique design...for many characters. hand to hand with some comedic focus, the show definitely creates visuals well-worth keeping your eyes on.The show looses a lot of points though (skip to the next paragraph if you haven´t watched it as this sentence may have minor spoilers) is how the central plot makes no progress. This is a big thing for light novel adaptations such as this one, but it takes almost ridiculous levels in this show.It is not the only trope the show uses badly though, as the majority of it´s characters are rather bland and the show often tries to shove relatability down our throats like it´s sour medicine...that doesn´t work. It also tends to re-use it´s comedy a bit too often, making them get old really fast, and while we do get some amazing comedy sequences on the show´s lined-up misunderstanding style, it can be enough for you to zone out and miss out on important parts.It does make a comeback on it´s side-characters, though, as the line between main and side-characters is rather blurry. The distribution of focus on this anime is rather refreshing, allowing a lot of it´s side-characters to have a proper spotlight not just making things more immersive as a slice of life, but also upgrading characters beyond plot devices. However, even here plot and characters generally don´t change, have little progress. As there is nothing to do, characters are just set to goof around and it makes the whole thing ultimately feel quite pointless.This is not just about being a slice of life show, but it goes beyond that. The fatal flaw of this show, it seems, is the premise. There is very little to really explore if you´re not willing to let go of the thing you think your character relatable to the audience, in this case, how the main character is a giant otaku. This results in an emptiness regarding any kind of story and while the show is definitely trying it´s best at coming up with fresh ideas, there is really only so much you can pull. A lot of it´s problems, bland characters, repetition of jokes, etc... are something I believe comes from this.In conclusion, ""kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru!"" is a happy show that is great to relax to, but plays safe a bit too much regarding it´s main character which empties it´s premise of what little potential it could have in the first place. Watch if you´re into art and slice of life as the show definitely knows what it is doing in that department, but don´t if you´re looking for some deeply fleshed out romance or characters. Ultimately, it´s an OK show that nonetheless would likely be better off as a short-episode anime. for many characters. hand to hand with some comedic focus, the show definitely creates visuals well-worth keeping your eyes on.The show looses a lot of points though (skip to the next paragraph if you haven´t watched it as this sentence may have minor spoilers) is how the central plot makes no progress.

(in short I should say that is)Lets start out with the story shall we.The story is kind of structured like a generic Slice of Life or Romcom (Which I feel it was both). It makes the story run a bit slow at times and sometimes throws you into interesting scenarios. But although I quite enjoyed the concept of the story and even though it ran a bit dry from time to time it still had this thing that kept me coming back for more. Just to see really what wacky things the characters would be up...to next.I\'m just going to add my Art and sound together.I found these both to be about average the art style is kind of quirky and different but nothing I\'d write a whole paragraph about so... Meh?While I found the opening theme to be one of the better ones I\'ve heard I also found that that\'s about all I remember from the soundtrack. But the emotion in the voices were great so good for them?Now time for Characters (and this is the exciting part I found)So the characters are really what made this story and the anime so great to watch. Let\'s put it this way there is kind of a Love Triangle (if you could call it that) between a main character (there are a few of them) another main characters and his ""waifu\'s"". Now this makes things a bit hard for the main character and gives her conflict that pretty much makes up the entire story. If she really can handle all of this and although you don\'t really see herself grow as a character the story is set in such a way that you\'ve seen how she got there. While that happens the other characters kind of act as the almost sitcom style comic relief.Now it\'d be hard to get into why I enjoyed it so much without giving anything away but I\'ll just say that it\'s all about the characters.Overall I found this to be quite enjoyable but due to how the story can easily run dry (especially if you try to watch large amounts in a single sitting), you may want to watch this series in smaller dosses. The comedy is pretty original with the occasional anime typical jokes thrown in there too.Thanks for reading and hope this helped you a bit to next.I\'m just going to add my Art and sound together.I found these both to be about average the art style is kind of quirky and different but nothing I\'d write a whole paragraph about so...

SO AVERAGE.It\'s not bad, it\'s just average. I knew there would be no story to speak of when going in, there almost never is any real story for shows like this, if you want story you need to go for light novels(most novels have a fairly good one since everything depends upon it) or long running manga that are more serious in nature. In the first place you can\'t expect anime to cover a lot of story with the diluted plot you get after processing it from the manga.Anyway, I didn\'t come here for any special plot or story, I watch stuff like...this to laugh and a serious story just tends to get in the way, so it\'s not a minus that there\'s none. However, I feel like I\'ve seen this anime dozens of times at least. It\'s hard to laugh, at most I get a chuckle now and then and some light-hearted smiles. Clichés are everywhere, seriously. This entire thing is pretty much just more food for the romcom starved people that love their clichés. I\'ve pretty much seen every character in this thing with another name and look in another story, often several of them in the same work, that\'s how overused this is. It\'s so damn overused. It\'s clear that the author just copy-pasted the generic stereotypes from other novels/manga/anime that ""works"" and thought ""it\'s tried and tested, failsafe, mwahahaha"", literally no effort whatsoever can have been put into making these characters and the least interesting ones are probably the two mcs.However, not only are the characters so overused and generic that you will feel like you\'ve seen them countless times before, the story setting is the same. Yet another school romcom with some oddballs and a club setting, gosh, we haven\'t seen that before, right? It doesn\'t make it better that the jokes are stale as well and you WILL have heard/seen most of them before, extremely predictable. The author is not even trying to be imaginative and new-thinking, he\'s just comfortably recycling stuff that has worked in other anime/manga in a way that will make you sincerely believe that he is just sitting there flipping through other works and ripping them off when he finds something amusing while slightly changing it in one way or another, effectively catering to people who love that stuff way too much.I didn\'t really hate it, I just thought it was somewhat boring since it felt like I had seen it all before and that the author didn\'t even try to make stuff different. It\'s hard to make something completely fresh and new, but I\'d like to at least see an effort to not adhere to EVERY character/story/joke cliché with no exception and come up with some new stuff, at least get one or two original characters.Do I think you should watch this? Quite honestly, no. Unless you love the clichés this thing offers, you will be bored to death. I recommend reading the manga instead, it will go faster and therefore it will be more interesting. Some stuff just doesn\'t adapt well into anime. This is one of those things, that is better as a manga. It will still be the same clichés and other crap, but at least it will not bore you to death with more fast paced progression. this to laugh and a serious story just tends to get in the way, so it\'s not a minus that there\'s none.

With a quirky argument about the world\'s least artistic art club. Many scenes of his comedy are based on Cliches typical of this genre.The animation is well done and the Soundtrack is also good, the background music goes well with the type of series, the opening is something sticky but it is lively in a mediocre way.The characters: Mizuki is the only one who really caused me some grace with his behavior Tsundere towards Uchimaki (who will NEVER look at it as I can see), the rest of characters (Colette, the President, the girl Chunibyo and the teacher who...Looks like a student) have nothing of charisma and are somewhat boring.The story about Mizuki trying to get Uchimaki (an obsessed Otaku) to focus on her, while attending an Art club where the only ones who draw are the two, because the rest of the members do not do it or they are lazy guided by a teacher Who looks more like a high school student moe. While a ""rival"" appears (which in the end turns out not to be) as obsessed with the anime as Uchimaki, let\'s say it could be better led and more ordered.Even so, I can not classify it as a bad series, it fulfilled my expectations according to what I expected from this anime.

For your characters you have a kind cute girl who likes the MC, there's the MC himself being your run of the mill, dense as a neutron star otaku, an air headed girl, an otaku girl who serves as a rival to the main...love interest, and the lazy senpai who does essentially nothing. Where have a seen this before? Oh yeah that's right literally everywhere. The show was fine, it was like empty calories: tastes good in the moment but in the end isn't filling at all. In all honesty this anime would have gotten an overall rating of 6 from me if the ending was at all satisfying, but it wasn't. Literally nothing happens and their relationship stays in the same place with zero character development anywhere to be found. Go ahead and watch this anime if you want to but don't be expecting a masterpiece because you will be sorely disappointed. love interest, and the lazy senpai who does essentially nothing.

It didn\'t look like it was anything too promising and didn\'t seem to bring a whole lot to the table. Just a follow the beaten-path show that you\'ll see many of every season. However due to me watching this in my Summer months when I have allot more free time to watch anime on my hands, I decided to pick it up. This Art Club Has a Problem! was much better than I expected it to be going into it, it...leaned more towards the comedy aspect than the high school romance which really made this anime different compared to other high school rom-com\'s.This Art Club Has a Problem did definitely have it\'s romantic aspects to it... There were even a few episodes where it was the main focus. However they never took ""love"" too seriously in this anime, for them this ""love"" that was happening was nothing more than a segway to the next joke. Comedy was the focus in this anime, they never let things get too serious when it came to those romantic scenes, they always used it as a transition for the next joke instead of using it to develop their love for each other. I really enjoyed that about this anime, the ""love"" that was suppose to be developing between these too was treated as a joke, for some people that might be seen as ""poor writing"" but for me I saw it as the most realistic thing that could\'ve happened...Subaru Uchimaki shows absolutely no interesting in 3D women at all through out this ENTIRE series... If a true love formed between Mizuki and Subaru I don\'t think I would\'ve been able to tolerate the anime. Think about it a guy who\'s been put into lewd scenarios with these characters and had NO reaction to it at all would not just suddenly fall in love because she walked home with him after school or because he shared an umbrella with her or something else really native to these shows. As sad as it may be for Mizuki, it\'s much better that they never tried to form a love between these two and instead focused on making the viewer laugh at her desperate attempts and the follow-up comedy...If you\'re looking for a high scool romance you\'ve come to the wrong place, well I wouldn\'t say this is necessarily NOT a high school romance but I wouldn\'t say it was a generic high school romace either, they did provide quite a bit of fan-service though... Also excellent comedy errr-mmm hmm.

The main character, Usami is a normal female person who after joining the art club, finds herself surrounded with *interesting* personalities. Being the normal person that she is, she tries to proceed with things normally or making things go normal, only to get get dragged into mayhem caused by the other characters.Story: 7There isn\'t really a story in this show. It is more of the progress of the characters becoming closer and getting used to each other. Just like how you slowly get to know your friends as you guys just met each other, it is the...same in this show, just that in this show you start off with seeing their whacky personalities. There are a few sad undertones that realises how the characters are actually people with feelings too, even if it seems as if it is all just a fictional situation.Art: 9The art is clear and bright-coloured. It has a light palette and gives the show a fun and cheerful feel, perfect for the genre it is trying to bring across: Comedy. The character expressions are decent and makes you expect funny situations one after another.Character: 9Weird personalities mashed into one club does things pretty well :)First we have Usami the main character. As I said before, a pretty normal character but that is exactly why she\'s not bad with the cast of characters as she brings across the contrast all what\'s happening with what is normal.Uchimaki Subaru is whom the show is secondarily based upon. A true blue otaku at its finest! As if it runs in his blood, Subaru is the manifestation of everything that is Otaku and sadly for Usami, only otaku. Joining the art club with the goal of creating the PERFECT WAIFU, Subaru\'s wholehearted passion ends up influencing all the activities the Art Club does. And you get to see drawings of waifus from various other shows too ;) including a trap.....With Colette\'s downright weirdly interesting antics, Club President\'s unending yearning for sleep and Imari Maria\'s super cute and cool chuuni mode <3, they somehow mesh together pretty well and make up a hilarious show.Enjoyment: 10I\'ll be honest and say the extent of enjoyment is depending on one\'s own tastes but I can definitely say that the extent to which each character exhibits their personality is damn satisfying to watch how it plays out with corresponding the other character\'s personality and counter reactions. I had a lot of fun watching KonoBi every week and I hope you will as well.Watching KonoBi is a fun way to spend your time.

In Chunnibyou\'s story is all about ""chunni"" things but in this anime is a pure comedy.Story: 7I already stated that this anime is a pure comedy, so story is not something you\'re looking for when you decide to watch this anime.This anime focused on...its comedy and sometimes they put romance in it, but romance in this anime just like ""sweets"".There are 4 members in Art Club- The president, the funny thing is his name never mentioned in the entire series, they only call him by ""president"". Despite from being a president he never do anything, all he was doing only naps.- Usami Mizuki, the heroine, who loves drawing apple and in love with Subaru but always ingored because this guy only interested with 2D.- Uchimaki Subaru, the last member of the club and the main character, a guy who loves 2D more than anyone and only drew 2D-waifu character instead of ""Art"" things.- Collete, an underclassman who is also a member of the art club, doesn\'t do anything for the club and only having fun with themArt: 9Beautiful, suited the theme, not a single ""fail"" animation found.Sound: 8I always skip the Opening but not with the Ending. The ending song is rather unique to my ear and after read the lyric translation I find out that the ending song has something to do with ""Art"".They really put an effort with their track, 8/10 would find the full version of this song.Character: 10Those guys are all pure and so honest.

Right from the first episode, I knew what I was in for. A romcom that was gonna drag on for however long it aired on a will-they-won\'t-they-confess being the base for its story. I\'ve seen plenty of romcom anime that bring their own ideas / unique characters to the table. Ones that actually go somewhere with the ships, or ones that use the fact that the romance doesn\'t progress as the base for some creative jokes (ex: GSNK).  This? This....?The romance doesn\'t progress, and it feels unbearably obligatory, as if making it go somewhere would mean the end of the show. The countless...fakeout confessions make the process that much more exhausting.Side note: Why does Usami love someone whose hobbies she basically hates? He\'s obsessed with anime, and she barely (if at all) likes it. I haven\'t finished this to find out, but I\'m betting it\'s one of those ""he was so nice that one random time"" thing. Usami, just....calm down. Let the guy draw anime fanart.It\'s kind of funny that both Sakura Chiyo and Usami Mizuki are voiced by the same seiyuu. The contrast between the self-aware and hilarious parody of the shoujo genre and the unaware shamble of shoujo tropes is made more evident because of this.The comedy never got any semblance of a laugh out of me. It feels oddly....dry?All in all, there is one, and only one thing I walked away from this liking.The opening. fakeout confessions make the process that much more exhausting.Side note: Why does Usami love someone whose hobbies she basically hates?

The story is not really punched because the genre is slice of life, we can't much expecting about story or character. But the comedy is value from this anime. I can laughed just because simple interaction from each character without anything feel absurd or a lot fan service.I much appreciate how this anime deliver the humor. The comedy is flowing natural from how the character expresion and the act of voice act is really good.  Even this anime was airing in 2016 i still enjoyable watching this on 2021. "", 'tl;dr: A solid slice of life comedy held up by an amusing cast.This anime is centered around an amusing middle school art club and people they’re associated with. Each episode is the standard 24 minutes, but most are composed of completely distinct segments, and thus it’s essentially a series of comedic shorts. This comedy is entirely carried by it’s cast. None of the characters have that much depth in and of themselves, but they’re all pretty interesting and amusing and the writing makes good use of that for a lot of amusing situations.Of the art club, only one member, Usami, is really acting like a...proper art club member should. She also generally serves as the tsukommi to the rest of the club members antics, though with her easily angered personality and her crush on fellow art club member Uchimaki, she’s the source of a good amount of comedy as well. The relationship dynamic between the two is amusing because while a great artist, Uchimaki is a total otaku who says he has absolutely no interest in 3D girls and joined the art club essentially with the goal of painting the ultimate waifu. And he doesn’t try to hide these aspects of him in the least and it constantly results in him butting heads with Usami. But despite all that, she’s still totally in love with him. And despite her being totally obvious about it to the point that pretty much everyone else has realized it, Uchimaki is too dense to notice. If the focus here was actual relationship development, then this may have been frustrating, but as it is it feels the relationship is more a source for comedy than romance, and as such it fits the anime quite well.The other art club members include: Collette, a strange and incredibly energetic girl with an obsession with heroes; and the unnamed President, who is incredibly laid back, lazy, and just sleeps all the time. Though neither of the two ever really shown actually creating any art of their own so it’s a wonder why they’re in the club in the first place. Both have a decent presence the point I think its fair to consider them main characters, but far less than Usami and Uchimaki. What I think really elevates the cast of this anime though, is it’s really good use of reoccurring side characters. There’s a very large variety to these side characters, ranging from clumsy teachers, to meddling best friends, to chuunibyou transfer students, to incompetent and forgettable rivals. Most are incredibly simple, but they’re used well in a spaced out manner to keep things interesting, with the ones that are especially interesting being used just as much as the main character’s even I’d say. There’s also pretty good use of abrupt coincidences, like the random girl randomly met on the street in one episode just happening to be the granddaughter of one of the teachers as shown later on, that should feel forced or unnatural, but due to the execution manage to feel amusing in context.The majority of the anime is just these random comedic shorts, with the only real overarching elements being the introduction of new characters from time to time. Still, with the varied cast and varied comedy it keeps things pretty enjoyable throughout. I felt the last two episodes were a bit weak however. They drop the separate segments aspect to instead have a single story per episode, each trying to have significance beyond just comedy. The 11th episode is centered around the art club as a group of friends with the standard anime style emphasis on youth and the 12th has a pretty strong emphasis on the relationship between Usami and Uchimaki. There’s still comedy, but it’s paced much slower than previous episodes in favor of serious moments that are actually intended to hit emotional beats.I don’t think these emotional beats worked all that well however. The art club and everyone around them have a pretty amusing dynamic that fun to watch, but it’s not the type of group of friends that one finds themselves getting invested in, and thus the emotional beats related to that don’t hit all that hard. The relationship between Usami and Uchimaki is similarly amusing, but not that good of a romance in and of itself, and thus that too feels like it fell pretty flat, especially as no real progress was made. I get what they’re going for in trying to have a more memorable and substantial finale, but I really feel the story really wasn’t in a place that such a thing could be pulled off. With all that said, it’s not like these two episodes were bad, just weaker than the episodes before them, and thus while the anime didn’t end on what I think is a high note, it still left off on a pretty decent note.The art and animation in the anime was pretty solid. The character designs were solid for the setting. There were a few cameos of other anime that were amusing to see, though they were a lot more subtle and minimal than anime references usually are in my experience. The eye catches between segments were pretty amusing. The OP and ED both had pretty great visuals and songs that fit the anime incredibly well. The soundtrack outside of that was decent enough but not particularly memorable. proper art club member should.

Its not really a unique show but it is pretty good for just being 12 episodes to promote the manga. I wish this anime continued for atleast one more season though. this is definetly going to be one of the animes I come back to watch every once in a while. ', 'This anime fills his objective that is make a romcom, for me was very good a wholesome story that is really simple but very enjoyable.The story is pretty simple one guy that wants to draw the perfect waifu, the friend that has a crush on her and their friends that fills the time on screen.The ost is pretty much underrated , ok its not the bst that we could find but still is much better than the average romcom pseudo harem animes.The characcters development we dont really see that here, the anime doesnt focus on that matter they show you a romcom we some characters...that have his own role everyone.A pretty good show that its my prototype for RomCom(no romantic) animes. that have his own role everyone.A pretty good show that its my prototype for RomCom(no romantic) animes.', '3/10, would be a 7/10 but ill explain why.So, this is my first review, but I have been getting better at doing them from a separate media. I hope its not too long and I can cover all the bases needed for this show.""This Art Club Has a Problem!"" or as weebish speak would say ""Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!"" Is a small romantic slice of life that takes place in... middle school.... and has the mcs of the show doing aaart!Is a small slice of life of interpersonal relationships, dont expect huge things.We got the classic run down:-One sided unrequited love-...Usami Mizuki- nice, cant really say no, just stuff from a person thats getting by. Has a hot temper, but still is a nice mc for this sortta show.-Actual weeb- Uchimaki, Subaru- with his priorities being in 2d women which he finds or draws, (oh yeah they are super duper in an art club, almost like Nagatoro) (and yes, this ends up with a one sided love, Usami has a huge crush on this fella,-We have child that just shows up and is apart of the cast - Collette - comes up with ideas and has some missfortunes along the way, somewhat is used as a punching bag.His name, I kid you not, is -President - who seems like a senior, assuming you go by American based understandings of school, he sleeps all the time, but when he\'s not sleeping he\'s chilln around eatin snacks, but he still gets the ""best at everything when he tries"" plot device.A few episodes in, we get - Imari, Maria - who is the female version of Actual weeb lad, Uchimaki, and they hit it off well.Theres a few other characters, like Moeka an ACTUAL ACTUAL child, Ayase who swaps the narrative somewhat, the two teachers, and this one kid who looks a lot like Levi from Attack on titan and really goes:""ArRRRHGG IM GONG TO WIIINN THIS ART COMPETION""-Uchimaki wins 1st place""HOW COULD YOU Of BEATEN ME! I WAS GOIGN TO WINNN!""- lol okalso a few smaller ones that appear but im not gonna mention them cuz mmmm spoilers.So, now that we have the characters down, we can talk about the story.well, theres no reaaaal overarching ideas, but simply things that appear later on, like how Collette draws on one of the art things the other few were doing.These continuity aspects are really fun, and I like how each episode has like 3 plot lines and they all combine near the end, like Solar opposites, but alas, the demographic is drastically different.Final notes:This anime came out in 2016, but to this review\'s making, no second season, nor dub. Both of which are sad if you are an anime only. But alas, from what I can assume, and a few google searches, the anime ends at Ends at Volume 6, Chapter 38 (excluding chapters: 5, 6, 9.2, 23 and 35 to 37). (Stolen from reddit, thanks [Deleted]!The Manga is still going though, volume 14 will be released in August 27, 2021. So more then half we havent seen.------------------------And now the part why I rated it so bad.I assumed going into this, that this place is high school, but no. This is a middle school, with the club members being 13-15.This, really throws a wet rug on the whole show, because if it was high school, it could of worked well, but just keep that in mind... They are not even 16..... and they do some... ""sexual fan service"".This news to me came out when I looked at show\'s wiki after the show, (I wanted to find voice actors and details I may of missed).Last last thingy note: :LCharacters are displayed well enough to be called a good slice of life, the art is nice, especially later with a project they do, 3d is around because when is it not.There are a lot of cute scenes in the show, like helping help ACTUAL ACTUAL CHILD for reasons.And the intro and outro are nice.Thats about it, go watch it if you want a small side anime! Usami Mizuki- nice, cant really say no, just stuff from a person thats getting by. Has a hot temper, but still is a nice mc for this sortta show.-Actual weeb- Uchimaki, Subaru- with his priorities being in 2d women which he finds or draws, (oh yeah they are super duper in an art club, almost like Nagatoro) (and yes, this ends up with a one sided love, Usami has a huge crush on this fella,-We have child that just shows up and is apart of the cast - Collette - comes up with ideas and has some missfortunes along the way, somewhat is used as a punching bag.His name, I kid you not, is -President - who seems like a senior, assuming you go by American based understandings of school, he sleeps all the time, but when he\'s not sleeping he\'s chilln around eatin snacks, but he still gets the ""best at everything when he tries"" plot device.A few episodes in, we get - Imari, Maria - who is the female version of Actual weeb lad, Uchimaki, and they hit it off well.Theres a few other characters, like Moeka an ACTUAL ACTUAL child, Ayase who swaps the narrative somewhat, the two teachers, and this one kid who looks a lot like Levi from Attack on titan and really goes:""ArRRRHGG IM GONG TO WIIINN THIS ART COMPETION""-Uchimaki wins 1st place""HOW COULD YOU Of BEATEN ME! I WAS GOIGN TO WINNN!""- lol okalso a few smaller ones that appear but im not gonna mention them cuz mmmm spoilers.So, now that we have the characters down, we can talk about the story.well, theres no reaaaal overarching ideas, but simply things that appear later on, like how Collette draws on one of the art things the other few were doing.These continuity aspects are really fun, and I like how each episode has like 3 plot lines and they all combine near the end, like Solar opposites, but alas, the demographic is drastically different.Final notes:This anime came out in 2016, but to this review\'s making, no second season, nor dub. Both of which are sad if you are an anime only. But alas, from what I can assume, and a few google searches, the anime ends at Ends at Volume 6, Chapter 38 (excluding chapters: 5, 6, 9.2, 23 and 35 to 37). (Stolen from reddit, thanks [Deleted]!The Manga is still going though, volume 14 will be released in August 27, 2021.

Common anime involve complex romance between Subaru Uchimaki and Mizuki Usami, misunderstanding, comedy and motivation in the art club. Characters are very simple and cute especially colette and yumeko. Very simple that you no need to  research or check critics required to watch this anime. Overall this anime is kidda short with 12 episodes but you definitely have a nice sweet tea time and occasionally it will give you a great smile. 7 out of 10 for me :) ', 'Spoiler free.Story: 5Maybe i\'ve could rate the story even less, because there isn\'t a real story, only a sequence of situation that aren\'t well bonded together. There could have been a story, but i don\'t really pretend it from that kind of anime. In my opinion is a great waste of potential and a ""bad"" planning choise, but the show isn\'t that bad, so i\'ll stop the moaning here.Art: 7Here is so much a matter of taste, people, the style isn\'t original and the animation not out of ordinary, but on that point i have to say that there isn\'t a reason for having amazing...animations for that kind of show, they only will result strange!

It\'ll be a good change from getting my blood boiling from busting out a 3000-word rant of an anime I generally despise. So here\'s an anime review of a short, sweet and relaxing anime that surprised me enough to write a review on it.Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!, or ""Konobi!"" for short, is a one-cour series animated by studio feel- a studio that has sort of come to itself and started making some fairly big cult-hits like Dagashi Kashi and...the hot new romance that is Tsuki ga Kirei. These are a far cry from their more infamous (famous?) works like Mayo Chiki and Kiss x Sis. Konobi seems to be a sort of transition anime- something to test new waters on- a manga adaptation with SoL elements and a relaxed anime that doesn\'t take itself too seriously (with enough gimmicky situations to attract their old crowd) but also something that works hard to leave an impression on the viewer in the end. Does this work? Well, in a way, yes.The anime can very easily be taken as a knock-off Gekkan shojou or Chuunibyou and indeed the comparisons are numerous enough to not be slightly suspicious towards the producers of the show. The anime is composed of short stories that take up about a third to half an episode and mostly involve the characters in various silly situations. Just like Gekkan and Chuu2. Where this anime divorces itself from the aforementioned shows, however, is the continuity. The events that transpire have consequences that influence the flow of the show as well as having an impact on future events. This makes the anime very well paced and its incredibly relaxing shifting between the stories as the show expertly slows and speeds up when it needs to. This is helped by the fact that the show is actually quite funny.The characters initially started out as fairly normal middle school-SoL-comedy cast with the lazy Art club president, the male MC who has talent but applies it in questionable areas, a cloud cuckoolander girl who always finds opportunities to get up to her usual antics and the main character who has a crush on the male MC but is a class 2 tsundere and struggles to get her feelings out throughout the show- leading to comedic situations. This anime has some pretty great situational comedy. Things are actually quite predictable but the characters have enough charm with them that it just works. The situations the characters end up in are oftentimes unrealistic and happen for the sake of comedy but the anime knows this and balances it out with some great interactions between the different characters. There\'s even a character (Koyama sensei) who doesn\'t have any comedic situations tied to him and exist solely for grounding the anime. And he does a fine job. This groundedness and great pacing allow the anime to also work well as a slice of life as many of the short stories- especially in the second half- are simply sublime to watch.The characters are definitely the highlight of this show. They may not be original and they certainly don\'t do things better than the cast of characters from the shows I\'ve previously mentioned but they do have character. The main character- Usami Mizuki- is a fun character to follow around. Her passionate tendencies give rise to many hilarious moments such as the episode where the artist guy we never learn the name of (as a joke) trash talks on her crush\'s artistic style and motivations. She has such a large personality that its great to see her also have a more toned-down, perceptive and compassionate side to her to juxtapose as well as to add to the anime\'s overall relaxed nature. Her voice actor - Ozawa Ari - also voiced Chiyo from Gekkan. Whilst she was great there I feel she fitted the slightly immature Usami much better. The main male character- Uchimaki Subaru- is also pretty great. He\'s nowhere near as developed or well-explored as Mizuki and actually fits more into a generic main boy character. He has enough unique qualities to sell the relationship though as his generally calm demeanor also crosses into the territory of him having an inability to give a f*ck when the artist guy is trash talking him. Both he and Mizuki have solid background and motivations so whatever they do is perfectly reasonable and oftentimes hilarious. The interaction between the two in the various stories are fun to watch and the anime captures the innocent romance of a young middle school crush very nicely. The writing doesn\'t consider them as idiots and doesn\'t treat the audience as such either. They very much act their age and this makes every achievement- from completing the painted mural on the pool to completing the artwork made of cans at the end- all the more satisfying. I\'m genuinely glad the anime focused on the (developing?) relationship between these two as they provide an endless source of fun.The other characters aren\'t as developed but they have adequate amounts of screentime and moments to themselves. It\'s enough to explore their different attributes and I consider the short stories dedicated to them- namely Colette the cloud cukoolander and the Art club president - to be some of the best with their meaningful and satisfying aesops as well as the charm in full force. I mean, I can\'t be the only one who found the game of ""staying in the shadow"" played between Colette and the little girl incredibly cute, right? Imari Maria makes is introduced as a slight Chuu2 character halfway through and doesn\'t get nearly as much as she deserves- being only around sometimes and is overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Her optimistic outlook and her generally free-spirited disposition, however, sell her character in the few scenes she has. I just wish she was actually as important as the show had initially shown her to be but I understand the show\'s desire to not step into the realm of a serious romance too much. So as a supporting character, she plays her role well. There\'s also the new advisor for the art club- Tachibana Yumeko sensei who finds herself in hilarious situations much of the time she appears but also receives just the right amount of screentime as well as a very nice introductory story. And the story in the first half of episode 8 is genuinly hilarious with her.The animation is quite similar to those of Doga Kobo\'s more recent works, especially in the colour and lighting department. It\'s a mostly subdued art style that emphasises the SoL nature of the show. The thing that annoys me about it though is the backgrounds being incredibly boring to look at. There\'s little to latch onto the scenery like in Doga Koba and Kyoani shows (heck, even JC Staff will kick its ass). I wouldn\'t be so harsh comparing it to those well-established studios if it weren\'t for this anime being made to obviously compete with the shows those studios turn out. The direction is also very boring throughout the show and it tells me that the people making this were perhaps playing it too safe. The director- Okawa Kei- has directed Oregairu season 2 and the soon-to-be-released Hinamatsuri (which looks really good for now). He and the directing staff do improve over the course of the show as the characters become more closely entwined with the story but overall it is decidedly average. The actual animation itself is decent. I like most of the character designs and the change of art styles at times adds to the anime\'s innocent-hearted expression. Some of the character animations in the later episodes are surprisingly great- enough to compete even with Kyoani at times. It is, however, quite inconsistent in the first half with some characters not drawn to scale correctly and the CG cars being quite distracting. I can happily say that the second half corrects most of these issues though.The music is generally good. Unfortunately, I can\'t stop myself from comparing it to soundtracks in Doga Kobo shows. It really is similar to Gekkan- perhaps even more so than the art. It does have one soundtrack- ""Nijigenzuki de Warui desu ka""?- which starts exactly like ""Kyoushuu kara Mebuku Mono"" from Hibike! Euphonium 2\'s soundtrack. Exact same notes (you can copy paste the names to YouTube and compare). This anime aired a season before Hibike!\'s second season did so I find this situation quite funny. Both soundtracks are used in more emotional SoL moments in both anime so I can only guess two different minds came to the same conclusion on how to express the same type of scene through different paths. The OP is sung by Mizuki Nana and is not particularly great to listen to alone but the visuals do have perks I like such as Mizuki running with a paintbrush with red paint on the end- revealing the final picture she was painting at the end- an easy detail to miss. The OP sung by Uesaka Sumire is similar to Chuu2\'s ED with a cube in the middle of a revolving chequered landscape and the major characters spinning along. I don\'t really get it to be honest and I wish they put more effort into it but it works as a curtain closer.In conclusion, this anime delivers some great SoL-romcom moments that allows it to compete with more established shows in its genre. The characters are well-written and have great personalities that are well explored with enough time given to them. The bulk of the story is told from the perspective of one of the best main characters- even better than Sakura Chiyo from Gekkan shojou in my opinion (to be fair, Gekkan has an overall much stronger cast). The character interactions are all great. The anime has superb pacing and a well-executed format of half episode-long stories that connect well with each other. The writing for these individual stories is sublime and are either very cute, funny, fun or all three. The animation and music aren\'t great but passable and it\'s a generally good show to look at due to its bright colour palette. This is not just a knock off Doga Kobo/Kyoani show- it actually beats them in some aspects. Its an anime that doesn\'t take itself too seriously and doesn\'t try to win any awards but this adds to the charm of the show. I definietly recommend it to anyone looking for a SoL romcom.Other shows to recommend would be every show I mentioned in this review- Gekkan Shojou, Chuu2 etc. In fact, just go for most Kyoani and Doga Kobo shows (except Umaru). Tonari no Kaibatsu is an even more relaxed show with more mature high school characters in equally hilarious circumstances and situations (and better development).Studio feel is an anime studio I\'ll be looking forward to in the future. Adapting from manga while the rest of the industry is still in the light novel frenzy is certainly enough to get my interested. If this show and Tsuki ga Kirei are any indication of what might come, we might have a new talent in a world dominated by JC Staff, Kyoani, PA Works and Doga Kobo.Thanks for reading! the hot new romance that is Tsuki ga Kirei.

A love interest show more like it. Usami likes Uchimaki, but Uchimaki only likes 2D girls. They both meet at the art club and after Uchimaki helps a lost girl on their way back home, Usami begins to like him. Problem is, like I mentioned, he doesn't like 3DPD. Comedy ensue.Along with this ride we have the club's president, a senior highschool student that really enjoys sleeping at the club's sofa. I think he might be homeless. We also get Collette, a vibrant, energy-filled girl that we're not sure why she's there...but she's pretty funny so they keep her around, and Imari, an otaku and transfer student that is kinda crazy.It's hard to point exactly why this show is such a nice watch. The art is pretty good and the characters are really endearing. Even minor characters like the Kaori, Sayaka and Ryouko bring a lot to the little moments they come up. You could easily have entire episodes based on the minor characters alone. Same goes to Tachibana, the teacher appointed to be the club's supervisor.The show manages to keep up pace and juggle really well all its parts. The comedy, the love interest moments, crazy and nonsense scenes and so on. It's charming and quite entertaining. All characters manage to be quite likable and necessary in their own way. No wonder the manga is going strong for almost 10 years now. but she's pretty funny so they keep her around, and Imari, an otaku and transfer student that is kinda crazy.It's hard to point exactly why this show is such a nice watch.

The story was a little stale for my liking. The Characters were relatable, especially for an otaku like myself and everyone else here. This show was extremely average personally. As I watched I could predict nearly everything that happened. The show had nothing to make it unique. That aside I thought the characters were fun to watch connect. The fact that she had a crush on Uchimachi yet he had his ""waifus"" was hilarious. They did a really good job on making it clear to...the audience that it was a comedy. I found myself laughing a lot. I wish the show had more story to it, i feel like It could be a show i would recommend to people if it had some sort of linear plot to follow.That being said, No i would not recommend this show to people who want to see it for its story. Although, if you would like to relax and unwind while watching a pretty funny anime, this is just the thing to watch. Don\'t expect much out of their relationship though. I was hoping for that the whole show and was kind of disappointed at the end. So I don\'t want to lead anyone on, forgive me for slightly spoiling their relationship. But nonetheless, I had fun watching the show and will look forward to any specials or even a season 2.Thanks for reading. the audience that it was a comedy. I found myself laughing a lot.

Each episode (besides the last one) is made up of 2-3 shorter episodes; there really isn\'t any linearity in the story, but there are elements that persist and are expanded upon through each episode.---Art---It\'s good art, the characters look good and everything is animated quite well. There are some scenes that feel more bland than usual, but those are rare.---Character---Overall, the characters are average;...they can be classified as tropes but I didn\'t have too much of a problem with this. Now when it comes to development of these characters... well... this is where the ""Not Recommended"" part of the review comes in; the romance that\'s built up throughout the entire 12 episode show goes absolutely nowhere. The final episode built up to what seemed to be the logical conclusion to the crushing stage of Usami and Uchimaki\'s relationship (where she would ask the damn guy out already), only for it to come crushing down hard.---Enjoyment---I enjoyed most of the show, it was a very cute, feelgood anime, and the light romance elements that slowly built up overtime kept me smiling and rooting for the should-be couple. However, the last episode completely killed that for me, and made the rest of the show feel like a waste of time in retrospect.---Overall---If you don\'t really care about romance and all you want is to watch a short show about some quirky schoolkids doing quirky things, then I\'d easily recommend this anime to you. However, to anyone going into this anime hoping for a happy romcom with a satisfying conclusion, I\'d strongly recommend you look elsewhere. they can be classified as tropes but I didn\'t have too much of a problem with this.

Kimi ga Nozomu Eien,https://myanimelist.net/anime/147/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien,"['Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is one of the anime that I know is not perfect, but I can\'t find any category to deduct points on. It perfectly bridges the connection between drama and anime.  Structure-wise, it is probably one of the best drama anime, due to its non-stop, suspenseful, concise storytelling in only 14 episodes.  The mistake of many drama series is to drag out the same dramatic plot for 24 episodes, but Kimi ga Nozomu Eien knows when to stop so the drama doesn\'t grow tedious.  There\'s no fillers, guest appearances, onsen excursions, or any of the sort.  From the...beginning to end, nothing was left out, and nothing was excessive.Disclaimer: It is impossible to completely review this anime without giving up some minor spoilers.  If the above paragraph convinced you to watch the anime, then please do so without reading on.  If it did not, then you can read on; no major spoilers are present.Story: 10/10If I had to pick the anime with the best plot, it would have to be Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.  Not only does the plot draw you in captures your attention, it is also unique in many ways:  It takes on life during and after a relationship, not so much two people trying to convince themselves that they like each other for 20 episodes.  In this way, the audience does not need to any unnecessary funny introductions or excessive blushing, but rather, the first episode sufficiently provides all the information needed to move on.Just when the anime was starting so look like a typical high school romance, disaster strikes, deeply affecting the four friends.  This is when Kimi ga Nozomu Eien enters a three year time skip, frequently revealing what happened during that time through short flashbacks.  The plot from here on is very unsettling and highly subjective, exploring many major themes such as friendship, betrayal, love, aspirations, endeavors, and escaping from reality. All of this comes together at once, consistently driving the story forward to the very end.Art: 9/10, Sound: 10/10Although the art was only decent, the 9 rating goes to the portrayal of human emotions.  As you can expect for a drama series, this aspect is very important and crucial to complementing the dramatic plot.  All of this was done brilliantly in accompany with great background music.  I can relive, in my head, half of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien\'s final episode because the series integrates the aspects of art and sound so well that the events becomes memorable.Music alone deserves a special mention.  For the first and second episodes of the anime, there were no opening sequences.  That doesn\'t mean that the anime did not have an opening. The opening starts out with a scene with Mitsuki swimming and Haruki watching, Takayuki and Shinji talking under a tree, and all of this was accompanied with soft, soothing music.  The ending for the first episode was nothing except Mitsuki silently listening to the Haruka\'s voice on the answering machine as the credits roll by.  In fact, it wasn\'t until the second episode that there was an ending. This ending sequence, called Rumbling Hearts, is the second best ending sequence I have ever seen; it continues the story from the second episode in an amazing way. The best, however, is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, the ending for the 14th episode.  It is an emotional sequence, summarizing the entire series with the lyrics of a song.  In my opinion there could not have been a better way to end the series, and the conclusion of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is probably the reason why the series is still my number one favorite.Character: 10/10Three of the four original high school students were presented with the utmost detail.  The fourth, however, was not.  While some people did not like this, I am very comfortable it.  Even though the story is technically about the four high school students, the plot was only between three, so the (dis)appearance of Shinji for some time was understandable.  He did play a very big role later on in the plot, although it did not explore much more about him that we couldn\'t already assume in the first two episodes.  I agree with this decision to turn Shinji into a supporting character because it clarifies the plot without leading it into confusing territories.With this anime specifically, supporting characters are one of its most important elements, maybe even more so than the main characters.  It was the main characters\' actions that created the plot, but it was Akane, Shinji, Fumio, and others that actually drive the plot forward.  And then there\'s Ayu and Mayu, the well-needed comic relief of the series.  The balance of character development in Kimi ga Nozomu Eien was perfect down to the very last character, neither too excessive or lacking.Enjoyment: 7/10The first time around this series will be excrutingly painful.  No matter which female lead you like, there will be moments where you feel very sad and sorry for a character, and it is just not a story you will want to sit through and enjoy.  Even though I\'m a pretty tough guy, I was teary for certain scenes of the final episode.  It doesn\'t really have a great re-watching value either, but one time watching through it is all you need.  You will end up watching specific scenes over and over again though, so you can be prepared for that.  It is enjoyable once it\'s over, but it might not while you\'re watching it.Overall: 10/10All that aside, it is an excellent series that you have to watch and experience.  It is not for everyone; people who haven\'t watched a drama or romance series should not start with Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.  There are several memorable moments, such as the train station in episode two, Haruka telling the story of the fairy in episode fourteen, and Akane reading Haruka\'s story in episode fourteen.  If you are looking for a deep yet concise drama/romance that doesn\'t drag on endlessly, then Kimi ga Nozomu Eien for you.  I highly recommend it to all who can stand a little bit of drama.Akane: ""Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho.

It shows some promise in the first couple of minutes, but in the end, all it ever does is puke insincerity and exaggeration at your shoes. Taking this anime seriously for but only a second is a tedious and difficult task. I wouldn't recommend trying it to anyone, my suffering is enough alone.Story:A story? Come on, that is the last thing that this anime accomplishes to establish. A lovey-lovey sugar sweet drama with all...sorts of different and complex conflicts? Please, if anything, you will laugh at the complete idiocy of it all. Fake fake fake! If anything even remotely similar would happen in reality I would be the first one to praise its uniqueness. As if the protagonist wasn't false to the bone enough, most conflicts could be handled just by communication alone. I'm left to wonder if there could actually be someone as stupid as him - as if that wasn't enough, I'm almost crying my eyes out silly that; of course, if a boy has a girl buddy in fiction, they automagically hook up. Seemingly, fiction seems to imply that males cannot have female friends without having a &quot;thing for them&quot;. If you dare call this a good drama I'm left to pity you - go read Shakespeare's Othello. Whilst this anime has a thing for conflicts it executes them poorly and you're left confused with how this can even slightly relate to reality. It amuses me how people can call this slice-of-life when the relations are perfect, the conflicts are perfect, the setting is perfect, and the other seemingly non-important people are perfect; and of course, the ending is &quot;perfect&quot;. Yes, all perfect conflicts have perfect solutions, that's why you sure as hell can call this anime slice-of-life. You're not left amazed and flabbergasted of how this perfect story hangs you on the edge of the cliff with such an astonishing suspense. No, it has a suspense indeed - but it's a suspense of stupidity. Half of the suspense would wither away if only the protagonist wasn't so foolish. You could cut more than half of this anime by destroying the perfect settings and the perfect supporting characters. Doing this would actually be reasonable and actually add to this anime's credibility, but then everyone would see through this pile of sickening goo, that adds nothing but laughs and tears to the wonderful genre that is drama.To put all of that short; this anime tries violently to be something it never was, and never will be.Art:Pitiful and shockingly disgusting to watch. I can not say anymore, as it was fail to begin with. Of course you need some big round oh-look-at-the-five-light-sources eyes to achieve empathy with the characters. Amusingly, this relates to the story and proves a poor attempt at making an anime you're supposed to feel sympathetic towards. It was nothing short of awkward to watch.Sound:Oh, I'm quite confident that all people have those cute lullaby voices. I have to be honest and confess something, at one point in this anime, at one of those supposedly heart-warming tear-jerking scenes I was about to reconsider this anime's good points, when suddenly I'm bombarded with cutey comments that reek of incredibility in my ears. I could not stand the voice-actors, and even less the opening. What the opening succeeds to do is show you smiling girls and remind you of how fantastic the story is. The originality stuns me. The music broke through at some moments but was left unmemorable, which is far from a good thing in this context, disappointingly.Character:One of the extreme downsides of this anime, my dislike of the protagonist should seem obvious but that's actually not the worst. Yeah, are there worse? Oh, believe it.Aside from the perfect relationships that are foolish, the protagonist who is nothing short of foolish, there is the rest of the cast who are pure fools. Alongside the protagonist the other two -main-characters show little integrity thought capability. It's like you're watching a show of puppets. Whilst the Muppets is also fake at least they manage to show some original personality - this show only again proves that it can't do anything but fling out perfect personalities that is just so short that you're supposed to feel rapport with them, whilst still understanding that this sort of personality can lead to conflicts. If you haven't realized by then the extreme improbability of this anime, you should at least by the time the characters are introduced.Enjoyment:Is it even possible?Overall:Probably one of the worst drama slice-of-life I have ever run across.

It puts a dent on these genres that might never be repaired."", ""This is quite possibly the best anime drama I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot considering that I usually am drawn to more action oriented anime.  One phrase that could describe Kiminozo is 'a beautiful mess of emotions.'  The basic concept or plot puts Takayuki (the main male character) on the theme of choosing someone he loved dearly in the past, or staying with the girl he loves now in the present.  A majority of the anime shows the feelings and emotions that take place while Takayuki is deciding on who to ultimately be with in the end.  This...is what makes the anime so great.  One truly has sympathy to the characters as they struggle with their feelings.  Eventually, you'll start rooting for the character you want Takayuki to choose and thus motivates you to continue watching.  This leads up to the dramatic conclusion in which Takayuki chooses the girl he loves...who is the girl he chooses?  You will have to watch to find out.  All I can say is that the girl I wanted him to end up with got chosen.  :)The animation isn't too bad, but it isn't great either.  I felt the character designs were great though.  Kiminozo also has some pacing issues.  There were some moments where it just felt too dragged out and not much was happening.  However, if you're the type who enjoys slow and painful dramas that continuously builds, then you'll enjoy this aspect of Kiminozo.  Another problem focuses on two co-workers of Takayuki that provide comic relief.  I felt that they did an excellent job with the comic relief since after painful, dramatic, and depressing scenes, the anime usually focuses on the two co-workers to lighten up the mood, but most viewers would say that these scenes of comedy ruin the impact of the sadder moments.  The ending itself also left me feeling unsatisfied.  After watching this emotional rollercoaster, I expected the ending to be nothing short of spectacular, but instead it was just a 'good' ending.Some other stuff I would like to point out is that the first two episodes serve as an introduction to the main story.  I would highly recommend to continue watching until at least the third episode.  The first episode gives the impression that it's going to be a bland, generic, 'highschool life' anime, which this is definitely not.  After watching the second episode though, most everyone continues watching to see what happens next.  Personally, I absolutely loved this anime and I'm incredibly bias towards giving this a perfect 10.  However, that wouldn't be fair to those who are actually using this review to decide whether or not to watch KGNE, so I have pointed out some of the faults this anime has.  Overall, I would say if you enjoy dramas, then I would recommend this wholeheartedly.  However, if you're more action oriented, expect explosions, and do not particularly enjoy the 'slice of life' genre, you might not enjoy KGNE, but I would still say check this out.Rating+ Good, realistic character designs+ Interesting story with a good theme tying it all together+ Excellent depiction of human emotion- Some pacing issues- Some misplaced comic relief9 out of 10 is what makes the anime so great.

I understand slowly introducing a person to the idea that a period of time has in fact passed, but to out right lie and treat the person as if they are an invalid or a mentally retarded person who can't pick up on the concrete clues around them that something is off? This question bothered me to the point I had problems picking up this Anime and it bothers me even after I've finished it.I have come to the conclusion that a comatose person is honestly not represented...well in this story. First off, I have to question the fact that Haruka didn't notice that her hair was longer then what it was or that her sister had gone from being flat chested to big busted. She would have had concrete memories of what herself and her sister looked like before her accident and you don't have to look in a mirror to tell if your hair is long.On top of this, I might as well mention that her hair would have been kept short as it is easier to manage, rather then those long locks that Haruka had in the Anime. I also doubt there would be any mention of rehabilitation while the patient was still within the coma, yet the doctor tells Akane that her sister is ready and prepared to go into rehabilitation if she just wakes up. I'll also add that rehabilitation starts as soon as a patient wakes up from their coma and isn't just about walking.Add to the unrealistic of the situation we find the characters in, the first two episodes were honestly a pain to get through. Haruka and Takayuki's relationship never felt like a real relationship. Haruka was crushing on him and Takayuki went out with her because she was Mitsuki's friend. There is no telling whether he really did like her or he simply liked being with her which were two different things entirely.A lot of this Anime storyline seems to be soft footing it around Haruka's feelings and not hurting them. Which is the real reason I feel nobody told Haruka the truth. It wasn't because she had some sort of weak psyche but because nobody wanted to see her cry and feel bad about having lost the years. Truth of the matter is, it would have been kinder to let her cry about the things going on around her rather then letting her find out people lied. And not small lies either.As for the art style, I wasn't pleased with that either. Sure, the characters had some beautiful designs when it came to the face, but the body proportions were awkward at times. I also think the high school girls uniform is one of the ugliest I've seen. And no... I'm not talking about the uniform you see with the typical sailor blue outfit like you see in the pictures. No, the color is this rather ugly shade of purple. This isn't to say there aren't pieces of artwork that isn't well done, but there is a major lack of consistency. Sound didn't stand out much on the other hand.As for characterization, for the ridiculous plot they were given the characters honestly acted the way they should have in the situation. However, goodness knows they shouldn't have been in the situation they were put into. I guess the best way to put it, this is the kind of bad plot line I would expect of a fanfic writer, where the fanfic writer has their favorite couple and throws in a love triangle to spice things up. The only difference I think is the fact that all the characters were shown in a rather positive light, though some fans of this series are likely to disagree and badmouth the character they don't like.I honestly did not enjoy the first two chapters. Haruka felt way to needy and there was always this need to not hurt her feelings and shelter her from the real world. I honestly hate doing this because it only ends up hurting people. I struggled with the lack of realism when it came to the situation, but I did find the character interactions in the last twelve episodes to be how I'd expect people to act in the situation. That also said, this took me multiple times to pick this up and once I did, I found myself debating whether to drop it or not. well in this story. First off, I have to question the fact that Haruka didn't notice that her hair was longer then what it was or that her sister had gone from being flat chested to big busted. She would have had concrete memories of what herself and her sister looked like before her accident and you don't have to look in a mirror to tell if your hair is long.On top of this, I might as well mention that her hair would have been kept short as it is easier to manage, rather then those long locks that Haruka had in the Anime. I also doubt there would be any mention of rehabilitation while the patient was still within the coma, yet the doctor tells Akane that her sister is ready and prepared to go into rehabilitation if she just wakes up. I'll also add that rehabilitation starts as soon as a patient wakes up from their coma and isn't just about walking.Add to the unrealistic of the situation we find the characters in, the first two episodes were honestly a pain to get through. Haruka and Takayuki's relationship never felt like a real relationship. Haruka was crushing on him and Takayuki went out with her because she was Mitsuki's friend. There is no telling whether he really did like her or he simply liked being with her which were two different things entirely.A lot of this Anime storyline seems to be soft footing it around Haruka's feelings and not hurting them. Which is the real reason I feel nobody told Haruka the truth. It wasn't because she had some sort of weak psyche but because nobody wanted to see her cry and feel bad about having lost the years. Truth of the matter is, it would have been kinder to let her cry about the things going on around her rather then letting her find out people lied. And not small lies either.As for the art style, I wasn't pleased with that either. Sure, the characters had some beautiful designs when it came to the face, but the body proportions were awkward at times. I also think the high school girls uniform is one of the ugliest I've seen. And no... I'm not talking about the uniform you see with the typical sailor blue outfit like you see in the pictures. No, the color is this rather ugly shade of purple. This isn't to say there aren't pieces of artwork that isn't well done, but there is a major lack of consistency. Sound didn't stand out much on the other hand.As for characterization, for the ridiculous plot they were given the characters honestly acted the way they should have in the situation. However, goodness knows they shouldn't have been in the situation they were put into. I guess the best way to put it, this is the kind of bad plot line I would expect of a fanfic writer, where the fanfic writer has their favorite couple and throws in a love triangle to spice things up. The only difference I think is the fact that all the characters were shown in a rather positive light, though some fans of this series are likely to disagree and badmouth the character they don't like.I honestly did not enjoy the first two chapters. Haruka felt way to needy and there was always this need to not hurt her feelings and shelter her from the real world. I honestly hate doing this because it only ends up hurting people. I struggled with the lack of realism when it came to the situation, but I did find the character interactions in the last twelve episodes to be how I'd expect people to act in the situation. That also said, this took me multiple times to pick this up and once I did, I found myself debating whether to drop it or not."", 'I do not have a very positive review of this series. While I do appreciate the effort of bringing the drama aspect to anime, and do say it really was a good marriage of two genres, I really really despise Mitsuki\'s character. I respect the fact that the author presumably attempted to make a more true-to-life type love triangle, what with not everything meshing together as anticipated, and not everyone coming out with smiles who deserved them, I  can\'t express enough how livid this series made me. I felt that Mitsuki\'s character was incredibly selfish and self-centered and maybe the main character was a...little too dense to realize what she was. I felt that the author attempted to make the viewers fond of Mitsuki by mentioning ""the pain"" she had been through, however, from what I saw, her ""pain"" amounted to nothing but the troubles she piled on herself. I felt it was a feeble attempt to bring some sense of pity and righteousness to her pathetic character. I do have to compliment the story-TELLING aspect, however. If the author intended to give the audience strong feelings one way or another about any character, they certainly achieved that. Also, for a relatively short series the story itself progressed nicely enough without skipping anything or dragging anything unnecessary out. That is really the only positive points I can think of. Other than that, the series held no enjoyment for me whatsoever.This series made me so mad my friend and I threw a cheez-it at the t.v. XD little too dense to realize what she was.

You might hate Takayuki or even simphatize with him and the difficult situation he's in and the imposibile choice he has to make, you'll really feel sorry for the two girls, Haruka and Hayase and you'll blame the director for all the suferince they are going through... but in the end you'll really be happy you had the chance to see such a great anime.AnimationThe animation is shoujo, big eyes and cute faces, apropiate to the genre, but it looks like they didn't give too much atention to the animation or they didn't have the money for it, but I can forgive them for that and still give them a full grade since this anime impressed me much and I got really sympathetic with the characters.Sound:The music was just right with the situation, and the Ed song is a real masterpiece, being sooo smooth and romantic, just a delight to the ears. The voice acting was good and belive, it has to be since it involves expressing many feelings, but moslty sadness.Only problem:... one thing that really bothered me was the restaurant duo, yeah the two little girls who seem to be a reminisence from the hentai game that this anime was inspired. the little girls ruined the mood, had no real importance and effect in the story development and if you think about it from the realism point of view i really doubt that in Japan they let 12 years old kids work in restaurants (minors aren't allowed to work)... butI'm not gonna lower a story or character point for that since these chapters were brilliant, i'm gonna lower one from the animation who wasn't 10 worthy anyway, just to show this anime wasn't perfect.Value and Enjoyment:In the end it's more that a romantic triangle story... it's about a tragedy, an imposibile choice and in the end about passing life's hard obstacles and growing up... we are all moving and &quot;the eternity you wished for&quot; is just a moment that passed.What can i say.... even if you're not a romance fan, watch this, there's always an exception to the rule, i know this one was for me! takes a huge and tragic turn that will keep you on an emotional ride like you never experienced in a romance/shoujo.

Right off the bat I’m going to say I have a sort of love/hate opinion of this anime. On the one hand I think the story is pretty good, the characters are for the most part written well and the music is excellent. However there are three underlining issues I had with this show.First problem. Somewhere along the line in the making of this show the writers somehow got the idea into their heads that this story needed comedy for balance. Sometimes that is...needed for certain stories but for a tragic love story like this the comedic element had no right being in there. Take a look at Voices of a Distant Star do you think that story needed humor, of course not. The problem is that not only is the comedy not funny its not even balanced at all, it just randomly pops up jolting you out of the mood of the story. The comedy comes in the form of two young girls that work in the family restaurant with Takayuki. All I can say about them is that there are so many words I can use to describe this element of the story; stupid, pointless, annoying, jarring, unnecessary, not funny you get the idea. The two characters just ended up being this sort of out of place scratch on perfectly good story. Takayuki doesn’t even seem to be the same person when he’s around these two characters, like he doesn’t even have all this drama going on in his life. Fortunately these comedy scenes don’t appear too often, and when they do the fast forward button is your friend. They contribute approximately zero to the plot and the point of the story.Second problem. Takayuki and Haruka’s initial ‘courtship’ I suppose you could call it, is way too short. It starts a bit abruptly in the first episode and only goes on to the end of episode 2 which is when “tragedy strikes” as stated in the synopsis. In the story it’s implied that the relationship went on for weeks but as a viewer all we really got were two episodes of it. Although I thought it was an interesting move to shift time to when the characters are in their 20s, those scenes of Haruka and Takayuki together in the second episode are the best scenes in the whole series and it really would have been nice if they’d gone on longer.Now if it was just these two two things I could’ve lived with it and gave the show top marks but this final issue is a doozy, a major point of contention among people that liked this anime. The ending. Obviously I’m not going to say what it is, but never in all the time I’ve been watching anime have I disliked and disagreed with how they ended a series, and I’ve seen evangelion. I’m not saying that the ending made no sense or that they didn’t wrap everything up properly, I just really really disagree with how they dealt with it. The thing with romance stories is that it’s all about the ending, if you don’t like that then what came in-between doesn’t really matter. The closer it got to the end more I got the feeling I wasn’t going to like where each of the main characters was going to end up when the music stopped. I mean this seriously bugged me afterward and I can’t help but feel that it was the intention of the writers. If you’ve provoked a strong emotional response with the viewer then I think you’ve succeeded at something. Whether or not it matters if it’s a negative or positive response is debatable.I could quite easily do a fairly objective bullet-point tirade on how much I disagree with the wrap up of Rumbling Hearts but that would require major spoilers across the board. But despite all my ramblings on the ending there is light at the end of the tunnel, something that saves this anime for me. It comes in the form of the four episode OVA called Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ~Next Season~, it was released a few years after the initial anime. The existence of this OVA only goes to reinforce my belief that there were many people that weren’t happy with the original ending. This OVA essentially rewrites the ending to the way it should have gone, as well as putting in new flashback dialogue to make the ending work with what came before in the original story.So if you are new to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien then I recommend your viewing to go like this: watch the anime up to the second last episode (13) and forget about the last episode (14). Then watch the OVA. This will deliver a much more satisfying and better ending.

It ran on Japanese TV from October 5th, 2003 to January 4th, 2004,...and has been licensed Stateside by Funimation; the third and final volume was released March 27th of this year.Story: The first few episodes focus on the developing relationship between two high-schoolers (Takayuki and Haruka), and how Haruka's friend (Mitsuki), who also has feelings for Takayuki is dealing with this.  Don't immediately write this off as your stereotypical shoujo romance, though; in the second episode, Haruka gets into an accident that sends her into a coma.  The next episode picks up three years later, with Mitsuki and Takayuki in a relationship, and Haruka just coming out of her coma.  The rest of the series is centered around what happens because of Haruka's waking up.This is one of the best romances I've seen in a good long time.  There's a real push-and-pull between Mitsuki and Haruka, whereas you're clearly meant to side with one or the other in most series.  Also, one of the reasons for the first two episodes, which may seem unnecessary at first glance, is to establish all the characters and get you involved before they start getting into the real meat of the story.  And damn, does the actual story of the series deliver.  Like Saikano, if this series doesn't make you cry, or at least get close to it, at least once, you're a heartless bastard.There's one thing I didn't like about this series, though: all the female characters.  Yeah, I understand that there's going to be a lot of them, what with it being based off a dating sim and all, but about half of them were simply two-dimensional and simply put there comic relief.   Here's the thing: they could've limited the story to just Mitsuki, Takayuki, Shinji (another one of Takayuki's friends), the girl he's pursuing, Haruka and her family, and the series wouldn't have suffered at all, though it would've been a bit more depressing.Also, if you don't like the way the series turned out, there is an OVA that's due to come out on December 21st in Japan that gives the happy ending for the girl who didn't end up with Takayuki (what, you thought I'd spoil it for you?).Art: I love the way they did the eyes in this series.  I know that's an odd thing to pick out, but they really stuck out to me.  Otherwise, the art's pretty standard; good quality, and pretty.  The only real color scheme I noticed was a tendency towards blues, purples, and greens, which are some of my favorite colors.Music: The OP and ED aren't anything to write home about, really; the OP's the standard female upbeat number, and the ED's a female balladish-type of song.  The background music's heavy on strings and piano, and it's nice enough, but it doesn't really stand out all that much.Length:  Just the right length; honestly, I probably couldn't have taken any more than what they had here, and any shorter than this, and it would've screwed the story over.Seiyuu: Takayuki's seiyuu also played Seiji in Midori no Hibi and Eusis in Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament, and Daisuke Ono shows up in a throwaway role, so that's a nice touch.  Good cast, overall.Overall: An excellent story with a strong emotional core that gets you invested in all its characters and pretty eyes.Story: 8/10Art: 8/10Music: 7/10Length: 8/10Seiyuu: 8/10Overall: 39/50; 78% (C) and has been licensed Stateside by Funimation; the third and final volume was released March 27th of this year.Story: The first few episodes focus on the developing relationship between two high-schoolers (Takayuki and Haruka), and how Haruka's friend (Mitsuki), who also has feelings for Takayuki is dealing with this.

To give a good explanation of the kind of romantic drama this show is, you need only look at the most recommended (by far) show for Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, good old happy go lucky ""School Days."" With horrible and indecisive characters, an annoying love triangle that is made annoying by said indecisive characters (mainly the main character, Takayuki), and lies galore, this anime may start off strong, but it crashes halfway through the story like a fiery train wreck.Story - 5/10The story begins with a...group of four high school friends. Takayuki has just recently become friends with the star of the swim team, Hayase Mitsuki. Mitsuki introduces him to a shy friend of hers named Suzumiya Haruka, who happens to have a crush on Takayuki. Mitsuki helps set the two of them up (see where the School Days aspect is coming in), but Takayuki is still a little unsure about his feelings for Haruka and causes her some trouble due to his indecisiveness. It\'s clear that he has some feelings for Mitsuki which he has kept hidden, and it also is shown that Mitsuki has some for him as well. Nevertheless, not wanting to hurt Haruka, he finally manages to start acting like a good boyfriend.However, tragedy soon strikes which sends Haruka into a coma for three years. And here comes the first of the many problems in this show: when someone comes out of a coma, it is not a good idea to lie to them about how long they were asleep. You can ease them into the fact that they slept for several years, but making them believe that they are still in high school for several weeks is just ridiculous.Not only that, but Mr. Indecisive finally managed to move and ended up with Mitsuki. Everything seems to be going well until they hear that Haruka has woken up. And then (along with the lies from Takayuki that make Haruka believe he only has feelings for her), the love triangle resumes full force.The show held up at around a 7 overall for me until around halfway through. While some things annoyed me earlier on, the real problems (and where the School Days part really comes in) around halfway and until the end are where I believe this show fails. The soap opera drama and dumb characters who make dumb decisions just destroy all of the romance this show originally had and instead leave a jumbled mess of lies, alcohol, and confusion.Art - 7/10Considering that Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is ten years old (it came out in 2003), the art is actually quite good. While it can\'t quite compare to Fullmetal Alchemist (sorry I haven\'t seen many other shows from around this time), it is by no means bad, and I actually like some of the characters designs quite a lot (especially for Akane, Haruka\'s younger sister). It does a good job of setting up the scenery and mood for the more dramatic scenes (even if the drama of the story often fails).Sound - 5/10The voice actors do a pretty good job throughout, but there\'s hardly any music that\'s noticeable. I noticed an interesting song in the second to last episode but other than that, paid no attention to it. For many scenes, there is just no music at all.Character - 3/10By far the worst category, while none of the characters seem bad initially, around episode 3 when the real drama starts, the characters slowly begin their journey towards the train wreck awaiting them. Takayuki (who probably inspired the indecisive Makoto from School Days) is by far the worst character in this show with the two main females characters following him for second and third place. After the tragedy that struck Haruka, Takayuki fell into depression for around a year and became a shut-in instead of going to college. Mitsuki was finally able to help him overcome his depression and since then he had not visited Haruka at all. He began working part-time at a family restaurant and began dating Mitsuki.Mitsuki seems to have a phobia of people swimming after she lost an important preliminary race in high school after Haruka\'s accident. The whole drama surrounding this is kind of strange because they just drop it at some point without ever really addressing it at all. Mitsuki is also a bad, indecisive character except that her problems are pretty much all caused by Takayuki. Almost every problem in this show can be traced back to Takayuki due to the fact that the problems he causes Haruka and Mitsuki have a domino effect and strike the people around them.Haruka is really only a bad character due to the writers\' stupidity in deciding that it was a good idea to have the other characters hide the information that she was asleep for three years from her. They also added in some memory loss thing to try to explain why she didn\'t find it strange that her younger sister had grown half a foot and finished puberty during the time she was asleep or why Haruka\'s hair had grown to twice the length it was before. So she just continues on in the hospital fully believing that Takayuki is studying for his exams and loves her the same way he was before the accident.The supporting characters are the one place where this anime does not completely fail. I actually like Haruka\'s sister, Akane, as she goes from a bratty middle schooler who enjoys teasing Takayuki about his relationship to a mature high schooler who truly loves her sister and tries her best to keep Takayuki from hurting her with his indecisiveness. The girls at the family restaurant where Takayuki works (Daikuuji and Mayu) are also good characters and are mostly there to provide some nice comic relief.Enjoyment - 4/10I did enjoy the first half quite a bit, but this show just dies and becomes a drawn out romantic mess after a while. Things slow down and I believe this anime might have been better off with a couple less episodes (maybe 11 or 12 instead of 14). You could get rid of some of the stupid, meaningless mistakes the characters make by doing that.Overall - 5/10While it has plenty of problems later on, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien does have a fairly good start. The art is also pretty good for it\'s time and some of the supporting characters are interesting. Still, the main characters and the idiotic decisions they make throughout the show keep this from being enjoyable and instead make it downright annoying. It\'s one of those shows where you just want to yell at the characters and tell them to stop being morons.If you did enjoy this, then you may like School Days and Suzuka, which also has a similar love triangle and drama. If you want a much better anime that is somewhat similar to this, try Clannad (especially Clannad After Story). group of four high school friends. Takayuki has just recently become friends with the star of the swim team, Hayase Mitsuki. Mitsuki introduces him to a shy friend of hers named Suzumiya Haruka, who happens to have a crush on Takayuki. Mitsuki helps set the two of them up (see where the School Days aspect is coming in), but Takayuki is still a little unsure about his feelings for Haruka and causes her some trouble due to his indecisiveness. It\'s clear that he has some feelings for Mitsuki which he has kept hidden, and it also is shown that Mitsuki has some for him as well. Nevertheless, not wanting to hurt Haruka, he finally manages to start acting like a good boyfriend.However, tragedy soon strikes which sends Haruka into a coma for three years. And here comes the first of the many problems in this show: when someone comes out of a coma, it is not a good idea to lie to them about how long they were asleep. You can ease them into the fact that they slept for several years, but making them believe that they are still in high school for several weeks is just ridiculous.Not only that, but Mr. Indecisive finally managed to move and ended up with Mitsuki. Everything seems to be going well until they hear that Haruka has woken up. And then (along with the lies from Takayuki that make Haruka believe he only has feelings for her), the love triangle resumes full force.The show held up at around a 7 overall for me until around halfway through. While some things annoyed me earlier on, the real problems (and where the School Days part really comes in) around halfway and until the end are where I believe this show fails. The soap opera drama and dumb characters who make dumb decisions just destroy all of the romance this show originally had and instead leave a jumbled mess of lies, alcohol, and confusion.Art - 7/10Considering that Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is ten years old (it came out in 2003), the art is actually quite good. While it can\'t quite compare to Fullmetal Alchemist (sorry I haven\'t seen many other shows from around this time), it is by no means bad, and I actually like some of the characters designs quite a lot (especially for Akane, Haruka\'s younger sister). It does a good job of setting up the scenery and mood for the more dramatic scenes (even if the drama of the story often fails).Sound - 5/10The voice actors do a pretty good job throughout, but there\'s hardly any music that\'s noticeable. I noticed an interesting song in the second to last episode but other than that, paid no attention to it. For many scenes, there is just no music at all.Character - 3/10By far the worst category, while none of the characters seem bad initially, around episode 3 when the real drama starts, the characters slowly begin their journey towards the train wreck awaiting them. Takayuki (who probably inspired the indecisive Makoto from School Days) is by far the worst character in this show with the two main females characters following him for second and third place. After the tragedy that struck Haruka, Takayuki fell into depression for around a year and became a shut-in instead of going to college. Mitsuki was finally able to help him overcome his depression and since then he had not visited Haruka at all. He began working part-time at a family restaurant and began dating Mitsuki.Mitsuki seems to have a phobia of people swimming after she lost an important preliminary race in high school after Haruka\'s accident. The whole drama surrounding this is kind of strange because they just drop it at some point without ever really addressing it at all. Mitsuki is also a bad, indecisive character except that her problems are pretty much all caused by Takayuki. Almost every problem in this show can be traced back to Takayuki due to the fact that the problems he causes Haruka and Mitsuki have a domino effect and strike the people around them.Haruka is really only a bad character due to the writers\' stupidity in deciding that it was a good idea to have the other characters hide the information that she was asleep for three years from her.

And I\'d be pretty good at judging (usually from the description and artstyle) which anime I\'d like and which I wouldn\'t. Some time down the line though, I decided that I should probably expand my horizons (probably due to getting into reviewing at the time - your opinions tend to not carry much weight when you give everything a 9+ rating :P), and started watching anime that I wasn\'t...sure I\'d like. ""Full Moon wo Sagashite"" and ""Kimi ga Nozomu Eien"" were two highly rated shows that I was skeptical about that I watched as part of my attempt to expand my viewing range.That 50+ episode series ""Full Moon wo Sagashite"" turned out to be roughly 40 episodes of disappointment, with only the last arc able to redeem the series, so I didn\'t start ""Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien"" (abbreviated as KGNE for the remainder of this) with much hope that it\'ll be much better than ""okay"" at best. After watching the opening episode, I concluded that not only does it look unlikely to rise above being ""okay"", it\'s likely to be considerably worse, because the first episode made KGNE look like a run of the mill romantic attempt-at-comedy show filled with extremely lame dialogues. Honestly, the only thing comical about it is how awful it is.Episode 2 was not much better, but ended with an unexpected twist that altered the dynamics of the show completely. After that, the series changed beyond recognition. As the episodes progressed, the characters quickly gained depth and realism, and I was soon completely taken in by the turbulent drama in the show. Each episode is more heart wrenchingly painful than the previous one, even when I thought the situations the characters in couldn\'t possibly get any more messy. Despite the occasional plot device and convenient timing used to set up some of the tricky situations, the problems faced by the characters are mostly very believable. This is not one of those ""Saikano"" type melodramas where the characters are always busy doing inexplicable things in order to make the story more ""tragic"". No, KGNE\'s drama arises more naturally, from characters being caught in realistic no-win scenarios, or making mistakes that I can\'t help but sympathise with. Comparisons with soap operas are certainly warranted, but this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing - soap operas can be engaging and addictive to watch too, at least in parts. And besides, KGNE has the advantage of being a tight, compact 13 episoder with a single storyline, so doesn\'t run the risk of getting tiresome after being shown for about 74 years like a soap opera where it might feel like the same materials are being recycled endlessly.KGNE is actually based on an H-game, but it\'s obviously done a good job of picking out the more poignant content while leaving out the more distasteful parts. Admittedly, some of the traits of a dating sim can still be detected within the show, which is a shame, but at least it\'s nothing as blatent as say, ""Clannad"", where I\'d have to be blind not to see it. Though KGNE is occasionally guilty of being too melodramatic, in general the emotions contained in the show such as heartache, frustration, and guilt all come across powerfully and convincingly. Despite the cast being composed of plain, ordinary people, their compelling portrayal makes them stand out. A lot of anime can polarise viewers into separate camps that support their own favourite character, but in the case of KGNE, even as a single viewer, I feel my sympathies being almost ruthlessly divided between the different people involved, just like the main character Takayuki is torn between his two main love interests. Abandoning either is cruel, and the catch is, of course, the more he remains undecided, the more he hurts those two people. Hayase is another wonderfully developed character, her pitiful descent into depression is vividly fleshed out and heart breaking to watch. There is no easy answer to any of the characters\' problems, and KGNE does an excellent job of drawing the viewer into this big, entangled web of conflicting emotions. A lot of people seem to think the characters don\'t act realistically because of their apparent lack of rationality that causes them to keep making stupid mistakes. But since when are humans renowned for always making rational decisions, especially when it comes to matters of the heart? The key issue is whether those mistakes are understandable given the context of the situation, and in the case of KGNE, this is very much the case.I\'m not sure what to make of the comedy thrown into the mix. On one hand they can provide some nice contrast against the gloomy mood that makes up the majority of the show. On the other hand, you can also argue they dilute the atmosphere. Personally, I think it does more of the former than the latter, but there\'s one thing that I really hated about it, and that\'s the comedy previews they tend to have at the end of the episodes. Occasionally I come across previews that are really good actually manage to add to the show, but most previews are forgettable and don\'t really make the show better or worse. KGNE\'s previews are a rare case where the show is actually worse off because of it. This is due to the fact that most of the episodes end on a rather depressing note, and this atmosphere is completely ruined by the comedy previews that comes afterwards.There are a few other weaknesses within KGNE too, though they are mostly quite small ones. For one thing, despite its astronomical increase in quality in the later episodes, the dialogue still occasionally plummet down to the lowly levels of the first episode. Also, I think Taira should have been given more focus and development. Though he appears in a crucial part of the story, and plays that part perfectly well, his lack of screen time made him feel like a character that exists soley for that purpose. And then there\'s the animation, though mostly it\'s fine, the dynamic scenes (luckily there\'s not that many) are pretty poor in general. And Hayase\'s blue hair also sticks out in a show that\'s so down to earth.The last episode of KGNEdeserves special mention for being an incredibly emotional one. It provides a fantastic ending that brings the series to a near perfect closure. Is it possible to establish romantic feelings for someone over time, or do those feelings need to be there to begin with? Interestingly, the answer that the KGNE ending seems to be leaning towards is not one I would expect for a romantic show (though perhaps it\'s understandable, given its H-game roots). As a series, KGNE may not be as perfect as its ending, nor is it brimming with originality, but it\'s an outstanding anime that succeeds at what it\'s meant to do so well that it changed my attitude towards conventional romance anime, and that\'s saying something. sure I\'d like.

This is the worst anime I\'ve ever watched and I regret watching it. The main protagonist Takayuki is just so annoying. He is so stupid. He only does whatever ppl around him tell him to do. And then we have the great Miss Mitsuki who is a self-centered b**** and doesn\'t care about anything else. She doesnt even care if her so called ""Best Friend"" Haruka is alive or dead. Only the first 2 episodes of the anime were good to watch , but it\'s in the 2nd episode that the ""tragedy strikes"" as mentioned in the synopsis. That was too quick. They...could have showed some more episodes of Haruka and Takayuki going out and all. The plot was okay. But it was pathetic watching the characters. Haruka\'s sister Akane was the only sensible one throughout the series.Takayuki later works in a hotel where we meet these two girls, Ayu and Mayu who were getting on my nerves. And the small part of  ""humour"" at the end of every episode was completely unnecessary. It wasn\'t even funny to begin with.Well I am glad Haruka parted ways with that stupid Takayuki in the end. It was predictable anyway. I could probably watch it till the end only because of the dubbing ,the english dub was good for this anime. The anime\'s just filled with a lot of drama. Seems like many ppl were unhappy with the main anime\'s ending, so they made another season for this one with 4 OVA\'s where it\'s all about Haruka and Takayuki. But the OVA\'s were equally pathetic.If you are sucker for typical romantic anime cliche then this one\'s for you. But I am sure you\'ll find some better romance anime so pls do not waste your time watching this anime out of all! :O :O could have showed some more episodes of Haruka and Takayuki going out and all.

But I am sure you\'ll find some better romance anime so pls do not waste your time watching this anime out of all! :O :O', 'Going into Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, I was a bit leery about watching ANOTHER dating-sim adaptation. The quality of dating-sim adaptations seem to vary between good and down right atrocious. For every Clannad, there is about 5 Majikois.  But its grandiose english translation, ""The Eternity you Desire,"" interested me enough to pick up the show. On the surface, this show might seem like a generic high school romance, but do not be fooled, the show is quite different from its synopsis. Very few anime have been able to make me feel such a whirlwind of emotions. Ranging from angry, to borderline major depression, KGNE...never fails to arouse strong feelings in the viewer. Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, although a flawed experience, is probably one of the most evocative romantic tragedies I have witnessed in anime.Story(6/10)- Kimi ga Nozomu Eien starts off like all dating sims usually do, in a high school setting. The first couple of episodes help to establish character relationships, their personalities and motivations. However, very early on in the story, tragedy befalls our main protagonists, and tone goes in a completely opposite direction. Surprisingly, the remaining bulk of the story takes place several years after the event, and shows the characters in their adult lives and how they were able to cope with tragedy.KGNE is by no means a ""philosophical,"" anime, however, what the show does is tests the nature and limit of human relationships. The question that essentially holds the show together is, ""Are my feelings truly genuine?"" And you will see characters constantly struggle to answer this question.I found the show to be starkly realistic in many aspects, but completely unbelievable in others. And therein lies the major problem that KGNE has, the lack of realism in certain parts completely ruin the immersion. It reminded me that I was in fact watching an anime.  For example, the doctor in the hospital is constantly smoking indoors, and her medical advice made me question if she was actually a licensed professional.  Especially, when her medical advice unnecessarily causes more drama than needed. Another problem is the terrible comedic relief. It comes across as poorly written, juvenile, and inappropriate. For a show this dark, some good comic relief is needed but it is so bad it will probably depress you even more.Art(8/10)- The art surprisingly holds up well today. It doesn\'t compare to most of the anime released today, but it is watchable.Sound(9/10)- In dramatic shows, more importantly dramatic anime, the soundtrack is essential to pulling off tragic scenes. Clannad wouldn\'t have been as powerful if it were not for Jun Maeda\'s beautiful and saddening compositions. KGNE is also strong in this regard. The OST never failed to arouse feelings of depression and anxiety.Character(9/10)- Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien would be nothing without its strong cast of lead characters. The characters come across as real people, with real world problems as opposed to the flat 2D archetypes that populate anime. Yes, characters may act stupid, and illogical but it falls in line with their individual pathologies. No behavior is contrived, everything falls in line with their established character. Despite some uncaring, shallow and selfish acts, there is no ""bad,"" character. They all come across as real people trying to find happiness in a bad situation.I can\'t really say I enjoyed the show, and I wouldn\'t hold it against KGNE, because it is a tragedy. Some parts where hard for me to watch, some parts were utterly soulcrushing, but that is why KGNE succeeds. It succeeds because, despite its flaws, despite its shortcomings, it made me feel something. It made me empathize with its characters, it made me feel sad and lonely. I was able to relate to every character in some capacity and that is an accomplishment worth merit. Now, some people will hate this show for it being depressing, or some parts coming off as melodramatic, and some will love it for the same exact reasons. I give Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien a 9/10 because the positives strongly outweighed the flaws in its story. never fails to arouse strong feelings in the viewer.

I give Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien a 9/10 because the positives strongly outweighed the flaws in its story.', 'I\'m at a loss for words. No, seriously I just don\'t know where to start since after completing Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, I\'ve turned into an emotional wreck. I\'ll try though.This anime is without a shadow of a doubt, the best nerve-wrecking, jaw-dropping and brain-tangling drama I have seen. And it gets more and more distressing towards the end. It\'s as if you were sitting on a ticking bomb waiting to explode. At first you think ""cool I got plenty of time to defuse it"" but after some time you realise that you\'re not gonna make it on time. You start getting worried, you run...around and a few seconds before the explosion you shout in utter agony. That\'s basically what the viewer will feel like when watching Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.The focus of our drama is an adorable (but sinister) love triangle, comprised of the three main characters - Narumi Takayuki, Hayase Mitsuki and Suzumiya Haruka (not to be confused with Suzumiya Haruhi, who\'s a totaly different character altogether). Basically, Narumi meets Haruka. Haruka falls in love with him and they get intimate. One day however, Narumi\'s beloved girlfriend is involved in a traffic accident and falls into a coma.The real story begins from there. It follows the lifes of our main characters as the relationships between them change like leaves on wind. The viewers are captivated (I was at least) and want to know what happens next. Will Narumi and Haruka ever be together again? Will Narumi be faithful? Those are the kind of questions that everyone will have on their lips.The anime presents us with a lot of touching moments and the drama is at times, unbearable. Therefore I do not recommend this to anyone with a depression because... you\'ll just end up even more depressed.Sound and Art are pure brill, sad, depressive and melan-super-cholic. You should get some tissues because you\'ll be sobbing a lot throughout the series. Opening and ending is very good. I think I\'ll be getting the Kimi ga Nozomu Eien OST because it really impressed me.I would have given this series a 10 BUT one thing is completely messed up. The ending. For god\'s sake, I don\'t know what it is with good dramas and slice of life animes but they always have a screwed up ending. Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is no exception. The ending will disappoint you so horrendously that you won\'t even believe it. I won\'t say what\'s in the ending, if it\'s happy or not (I\'m not even sure which one it is actually, that\'s how badly they\'ve screwed up) but all I\'ll say is that they should have done a different one.I enjoyed it though. I like dramas to be honest, I like strong dramas and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien delivers. It\'s simply a story of how one person\'s accident can change lifes of so many other people.This series gets 9 out of 10 from me. I encourage everyone without a depression to watch it. around and a few seconds before the explosion you shout in utter agony.

One day however, Narumi\'s beloved girlfriend is involved in a traffic accident and falls into a coma.The real story begins from there. It follows the lifes of our main characters as the relationships between them change like leaves on wind. The viewers are captivated (I was at least) and want to know what happens next. Will Narumi and Haruka ever be together again? Will Narumi be faithful? Those are the kind of questions that everyone will have on their lips.The anime presents us with a lot of touching moments and the drama is at times, unbearable. Therefore I do not recommend this to anyone with a depression because... you\'ll just end up even more depressed.Sound and Art are pure brill, sad, depressive and melan-super-cholic. You should get some tissues because you\'ll be sobbing a lot throughout the series. Opening and ending is very good. I think I\'ll be getting the Kimi ga Nozomu Eien OST because it really impressed me.I would have given this series a 10 BUT one thing is completely messed up. The ending. For god\'s sake, I don\'t know what it is with good dramas and slice of life animes but they always have a screwed up ending. Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is no exception. The ending will disappoint you so horrendously that you won\'t even believe it. I won\'t say what\'s in the ending, if it\'s happy or not (I\'m not even sure which one it is actually, that\'s how badly they\'ve screwed up) but all I\'ll say is that they should have done a different one.I enjoyed it though. I like dramas to be honest, I like strong dramas and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien delivers. It\'s simply a story of how one person\'s accident can change lifes of so many other people.This series gets 9 out of 10 from me. I encourage everyone without a depression to watch it.', '""you\'re like a disease, everyone you surround yourself with suffers..."" ouchhMitsuki\'s best friend Haruka likes Takayuki Narumi, but she\'s too shy to talk to him. Mitsuki being out going and a known swimmer in her school wants to help Haruka and befriends Takayuki herself. They become close friends and she een secretly has feelings for him. One day while meeting Mitsuki, Haruka meets him and later on confesses, Takayuki remembering Mitsuki and their friendship agrees to date Haruka. One day tragedy strikes and these three people will ahve their friendsships tested in ways they didn\'t imagine.This is a story about love, lies and loss. At...the beginning Takayuki and Haruka get together even though the y have nothing in common. Even though all things pointed to the opposite. When you picture someone else in your had when someone confesses the answer should be ""No."" But Takayuki is so flawed! But then again I\'m no dude and you never know when faced with these types of situations a guy would do the same. The feeling of the same throughout. Whoever you like you\'ll end up liking and if you don\'t it\'ll stay the same.[Mild Spoiler]Time passed and seasons changed but they stayed the same.. There was a chapter called “Moving on.” It should have been “Moving on… didn‘t work.” I get it, I mean it’s hard to move on from that specially because the person is not really gone to begin with.Characters:Haruka Suzumiya- (nothing like Haruhi Suzumiya) is just a victim, but she plays the role annoyingly well. The english version made her annoying to me but the japanese is not so bad. She was so shy and common, there really wasn\'t anything special about her in my eyes.Mitsuki Hayase- Some people might dislike her but I didn\'t. She was headstrong, at first, then love changed her and she became someone she didn\'t recognize and I thought that her character was easy to sympathize with. Her character makes you ask yourself if you would let love pass you by or will you chase it...Takayuki Harumi- What can I say, he barely showed emotions and was so confused it\'s a wonder his left and right foot never crossed paths. He is never honest with himself. His good point is that he could carry guilt like no other.Shinji Taira- He is Takayuki\'s best friend and his on screen time increases towards the end. Though not part of the summary plays a good role in this anime and is my favorite character, just because he is honest and not annoying. He was there for Mitsuki and he isn\'t involved in the drama that is their friends lives.The anime was not bad for running in 2003. It feels like it\'s happening now, it\'s not old fashioned. The English voices, I didn\'t like. Just because Haruka sounded so low and shy I had to put my volume higher just for her. Takayuki\'s voice sounded too old for him, he showed no emotion in it. All in all, it didn\'t go with him. Mitsuki\'s and Shinji\'s voice was ok, (unbiased opinion). Haruka\'s moms eyes were closed throughout the anime and she was the only one, I\'m not sure what to think about that. The soundtrack seemed to enhance the nostalgia the characters were felling and it was nice though sad.This anime is a great example that love is a sword that will either set someone free or hurt them with its sharpness. the beginning Takayuki and Haruka get together even though the y have nothing in common.

It may be only 14 episodes, but it manages to tell a good story and introduces to us characters that are realistic and with whom we can easily relate with.Although the first episodes make it seem like a story about high school life for a group of friends, from then on it goes downhill and we are shown how a cruel accident can change everything and the consequences that result from this. It becomes...an emotional drama in which the main character, Takayuki, must choose from one of the two love interests he has in the series. However, his indecisiveness and knowledge that whoever he doesn't pick might get hurt, only leads to more hurt and trouble for everyone involved.As you watch this series you'll end up supporting one of the two female leads, but even if the one you choose does end up with Takayuki, it's really easy to feel sorry for the other person as both of them are nice people and both love him a lot. This series does have a large supporting cast, but aside from a friend of the trio and the younger sister of one of the girls, they aren't really important in terms of the storyline.The ending is done really well, with a great song that fits the theme of the series perfectly. It shows what happens to the main characters afterwards, and I'm glad that even for the losing party she seems to have a bright future ahead of her.All in all, Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien is a flawed series (slow pacing in some parts/ lots of crying from some characters/ bad decisions being made which are hard to understand), but it explores a lot of human themes, revolves around some well-developed characters, and manages to draw you in until you finish the series to see the outcome for yourself. an emotional drama in which the main character, Takayuki, must choose from one of the two love interests he has in the series.

Eventhough KGNE is a romance/drama anime, you will find it focusing more on realism or a slice of life type.Imagine yourself a lover, a loved one, a sister,a friend, someones who wants to achieve something in life, or in short what any normal person would be. this anime portays such characters and the circumstances due a love triangle that they must overcome.If you are looking for an anime that touches your heart and involves real life experiences in relationships, this will take you through an epic series of emotional rides,...at the same time, leaving you to raise questions in every part.I highly recommend this to anyone.

I would advice you to save this for later, if you're still a teenager.The story is amazing, a real tragedy that changed the course of the characters' lives. To me, the best part is how this could be a real story. You can feel it through the characters, as they make their life decisions, going to work to put food on the table and trying to live life in-between in the shadow of the tragedy and its effects.I noticed, however, that a lot of people did NOT like the way it ended. Specifically, the...girl which the protagonist chose. That's precisely why I said earlier that this is for the young adult crowd, not for teenagers. This anime is very in-your-face and pragmatic. And the closing of the story provides just that. Essentially, when push comes to shove, people's emotions are really an ephemeral thing. What matters in the bottom line is how much time you've spent with a person, how dedicated you are, how much you've invested of yourself... these are things that even I, when I think of my teenage self, probably wouldn't have understood. But after growing up and going through some relationships, you'll see that it ended JUST the way it should have.I started watching it when I was 14-15, and I dropped it in episode 3, as I realized that this story is out of my scope.

Even if the romance is fictional, honestly it jumped around from completely awkward and unromantic moments to kissing and sex.Not my main argument, but the general lack of character development, coupled with the unnatural story development right from the beginning turned me off. The arc fast forward a few years after the accident in episode 4 sees Takayuki and Haruka together as...a couple just did not follow well, neither did the introduction of other characters. Therefore I don't understand the rave reviews to be honest and just had to give my opinion on this. Other than that, the art and music was fairly done in the series. a couple just did not follow well, neither did the introduction of other characters.

Three years later she wakes up and wants to meet her boyfriend (she doesn\'t know three years have passed BTW). However the MC is now in a relationship with with Harukas best friend and Haruka doesn\'t know that.

After the two first episodes the show just gets worse and worse. The worst part about this show are the characters. The MC is an indecisive cunt, the MC girlfriend Mitsuki is a whore, Akane (the sister of Haruka) is an annoying bitch and finally the MCs best friend Shinjii is the worst best friend on this whole planet. I would really like to say why but that would be spoiling to much. Suffice it to say Shinjii logic is fucked up and he is an asshole.So there you have it. It isn\'t the story that is bad its just that the characters are so extremely unlikeable that you just want to beat the living shit out of them.

There are some other minor characters but not worth mentioning. And then there is the book, not a character, but plays one important role in Haruka’s life.Takayuki Narumi – He is the Main character in the story. Haruka as confessed her feelings to him, and after some initial troubles, they start a serious relationship until the day of the accident. After that he feels responsible for not meeting Haruka in time and falls into a depression which lasts one year.

She meets Takayuki while he was rushing to the station where he would meet with Haruka, she encounters him and tells him it’s her birthday, she asks him to offer something and he offers him one ring, this fate encounter is what lead to the meeting delay that caused the accident, she thinks its her fault that Haruka is now in coma (in the game if Takayuki avoids the encounter there is no accident and Takayuki lives happy with Haruka forever), the ring symbolizes Mitsuki’s betrayal of her best friend. Latter she is helping Takayuki recovering from his depression, even dropping from the swimming competition; during one year she tries to suppress her feelings toward Takayuki, but one day she can’t hold those feelings anymore and reveals them handing her body to him, this lead to the end of Takayuki’s depression, but what will it cost in the future??During the next 2 years their relation grows healthy, but only until Haruka’s wakening, Mitsuki confessed everything saying it wasn’t Takayuki’s fault, saying she was desperate and it could have been anyone, it just happened to be him, shocked Haruka slaps her in the face and tells her do disappear, this will lead to a new depression for both her and Takayuki, leading to their separation, in an act of desperation she ends up sleeping with Takayuki’s friend Shinji…What will happen to her from here one??Akane Hayase – She is Haruka’s little sister and has as an idol and inspiration Mitsuki from who she learned.

The duo also stars in the omake in the end of every ep, the ""Ayu-Mayu Theater"".Ayu is a Hot-headed lousy mouth always bossing around and causing troubles to Takayuki or planning his downfall, she always ends up being scolded by him. But in the end she cares for him and shows his serious side, it appears she has lots of connections in the city, and in the end manages to find the Harukas’s book edited 4 years ago and can’t be found anywhere.Mayu, also known as Mayu-Mayu is like Ayu’s sidekick, always plotting something against Takayuki. She is soft spoken well meaning and a klutz, other than that there is nothing else to her character and no relevance t the story at all.The book - Mayauru no Okurimono (Mayauru’s gift/present). This book is Haruka’s favorite one, by reading; it’s easy to figure why. This book is the responsible for her first meeting with Takayuki in the library, the instant she fell in love with him. The story of the book is beautiful yet sad, and tells the story of their meting. The moment Haruka is telling the story is the most sad moment of the anime capable of leaving some tears left to the ones o hear it, it plays this important role in the story, Haruka wishes to have this book, but the book seems to be a rarity and no one is capable of finding it, only Takayuki with a copy bought in the day of the accident and latter with Ayu’s help will manage to find other copyMayauru the fairylost her memories and was living aloneon a hill in the forest.By a chance, a lone girl went thereand they become friends.The girl called many othersand they all became friends and played, but...because Mayauru wasn\'t human,she aged more slowly.The children grew bigger and bigger...and forgot about Mayauru.In the end, the only remainingwas the girl she met first.But...that girl became an adultand couldn\'t play with Mayauru anymore.Even so, after becoming an adult,that girl couldn\'t completely forget about Mayauru...and came again...And then Mayauru gave the lonely looking girl a present.Words of farewell.Up until then,humans didn\'t know parting words...Mayauru was a fairy of farewells.She was forgetting that...and that\'s why she had only goodbyes.The girl, now an adult,learned the words of farewell from Mayauru.Knowing the words of farewell,that girl...she was able to become the kindest person in the world...Animation: The animation in KGNE is good, nothing like we can find on certain animes, but does a great job here. All the character are nicely portrayed and detailed, the girls are given more detail than the males here, with more colorful clothing and eyes, also their faces look less sharp than in the guys, also the girls hair looks quite good here with some fluid movement in more active scenes. 3 years latter, the changes undergone by the characters is quite evident, everyone looks realistically older, the body proportions are correct for the age and there are even some hairstyle changes in some characters like Mitsuki who cut her hair, this symbolized her change into an adult women, the guys also look more mature, Akane is no longer the cute little girl she was and as turned into a more mature teenager. Haruka also changes a lot, her hair grow during 3 years without being cut and is now really long, her face is different, and her hands look the hands of a old women, the changes one would expect a person to undergo while sleeping all that time.The background animation is mostly in the city, but displays good colors with blue sky and some green here and there, the city is also filled with busy people living their live, sometimes stumbling against the characters, enough detail is given to them make them more distinguishably.To the end, the animation starts to get darker, often we see the characters on rainy day trying to solve their problems, and as Takayuki starts to work until later, a good part of the action takes part at night, sometimes with the addition of rain. Half of the last ep is passed during the sunset near the beach, with the animation acquiring an orange ton of color. Overall a good work.Opening animation – Both first 2 and last episodes don’t have an op, only from the 3rd to the 13th ep there is an op, this op shows all of the relevant character to the story in various scenes, and shows both before and after of this characters. Animation wise it might be a little better than overall animation…Ending animation – From ep 3 to 13, the animation here takes a different way from the op, showing only still shots zooming out of the group of 4 best friends under the Starry Sky (the music playing in background is Hoshizora no Waltz (The Waltz of the Starry Sky)) watching the stars. The last ed shows some images from before the accident where the friends are having fun and scenes of the present a few years latter where we see the characters leading their lives, during this we see Akane reading the book her sister witted and tells its story (this book seems to portrait the group of 4 friends, and hopes one day the can all meet again), we also see Takayuki passing by a bookstore and notices the book Haruka writted, he enters the shop and probably buys it; A much older Akane appears in some journals as a great athlete; Next shows Mitsuki with an happy face but crying. The last scene’s are the hill where Haruka confessed her love and a photo of the 3 friends before the accident. Te end is quite beautiful showing only happy moments yet it leaves a sad impression on the viewer…As a side note, the omake that plays each ep instead of a regular preview, is entirely in chibi form, except from some scenes that might show on a tv.Sound: Music – The music in KGNE sounds good, it always manages to blend with the moment, there are moments where the music is just left out, as it isn’t required sometimes, sometimes when the characters are alone, just thinking or other less important scenes there is no background music. In some scenes, mostly in the sad moments the music changes to a soft piano melody, the piano plays the most important role in the music; the saddest music is played on the final moments. During happy or comic moments, the music changes to a different tune to match the action. Overall the music blends nice with the mood, and sometimes it’s easy to go unnoticed while paying attention to what’s happening.OP – As I mentioned before ep 1,2,14 don’t have an OP, in the first 2 only a light piano music is played while the ep starts, in the last ep again only a soft music is played while the ep starts, this time played on a Synthesizer.The real op is the one that plays from ep 3-13, ""Precious Memories"" by Minami Kuribayashi, she is Haruka’s seyuu, this song is a normal pop song, but the lyric is very good feting for the show.ED – There are 3 ED themes, Rumbling Hearts"" also by Minami Kuribayashi is the first and plays on ep 2 right after the accident, this one I think both song and lyric match well the drama here and the change that will occur in the story.""Hoshizora no Waltz (The Waltz of the Starry Sky)"" by Minami Kuribayashi, here the music is more soft and gentle, together with the lyric it blends perfectly with the Ed animation and the story.""Kimi ga Nozomu Eien"" by MEGUMI, this is a happy and gentle song played during happy times, all of the sadness has gone, and once again a great lyrics tells the story of a girl who has overcome many obstacles and sadness in her life, but in the end she was alone.Voice acting – Here a superb work was done by everyone, always displaying the characters feelings the best way and maturing the voices as the characters also matured.Overall: This anime is one of the best of its kind, with an excellent and realistic story, great characters, support characters also did they job supporting the anime, nice music and animation; everything was great.If u are just starting to watch this anime, prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions, once you start watching it you are part of the cast, it feels like you are there sharing those moments with them.Prepare yourself, this is sad, and u if u have the courage it should be watched again, as for me, I fell I was actually there after watching it over again…Authors note: I spent a lot of time writing this review, looking at the internet for interesting information, spending time reviewing some important scenes and episodes, listening to Mayauru no Okurimono while watching this sad moment and transcribing the story, watching all the sad moments over and over again.Writing this review while thinking on the anime and trying to convey my experience to a piece of digital paper, made me realize even better how great the anime is and how sad, how much those peoples suffered, and even tough it doesn’t pass from some draws of pure fiction passing onscreen, it managed to make me feel the characters lives like if they were real people…In the end I thank u for staying with be trough the adventure this review is.I hope you enjoyed reading it as I did writing… Mitsuki Hayase, Haruka’s best friend introduces herself to Takayuki in order to carry her best friends love to takayuki, along with Shinji Taira, the 4 form a group off great friends.

Latter she is helping Takayuki recovering from his depression, even dropping from the swimming competition; during one year she tries to suppress her feelings toward Takayuki, but one day she can’t hold those feelings anymore and reveals them handing her body to him, this lead to the end of Takayuki’s depression, but what will it cost in the future??During the next 2 years their relation grows healthy, but only until Haruka’s wakening, Mitsuki confessed everything saying it wasn’t Takayuki’s fault, saying she was desperate and it could have been anyone, it just happened to be him, shocked Haruka slaps her in the face and tells her do disappear, this will lead to a new depression for both her and Takayuki, leading to their separation, in an act of desperation she ends up sleeping with Takayuki’s friend Shinji…What will happen to her from here one??Akane Hayase – She is Haruka’s little sister and has as an idol and inspiration Mitsuki from who she learned. She is very direct to express what she feels causing sometimes embarrassment for the couple, her younger self looks more energetic and has a bitter tongue, but in the end cares a lot for her sister and Takayuki, seeing him as an older brother. After the accident, she is the only one too stay by Haruka’s side all the time, visiting her everyday.

After tha Shinji goes to Takayuki trying to knock some sense into him and ends beating him. Other than this he doesn’t have much influence…Ayu Daikuuji and Mayu Tamano – They are the 2 maids that work on the same place as Takayuki, the Sky Tenple. They mostly provide some comic relief and peace of mind to Takayuki. The duo also stars in the omake in the end of every ep, the ""Ayu-Mayu Theater"".Ayu is a Hot-headed lousy mouth always bossing around and causing troubles to Takayuki or planning his downfall, she always ends up being scolded by him. But in the end she cares for him and shows his serious side, it appears she has lots of connections in the city, and in the end manages to find the Harukas’s book edited 4 years ago and can’t be found anywhere.Mayu, also known as Mayu-Mayu is like Ayu’s sidekick, always plotting something against Takayuki. She is soft spoken well meaning and a klutz, other than that there is nothing else to her character and no relevance t the story at all.The book - Mayauru no Okurimono (Mayauru’s gift/present).

I really can\'t not give this a ten personally, because I was able to relate to the main character completely thought the entire show, right up to his decision in the end. Me and Takayuki pretty much both had the same issues, especially the avoidance and misplaced senses of loyalty and responsibility. So needless to say, Rumbling Hearts (which seriously needs a better freaking name. I hate trying to recommend this to people, it sounds like the pilot for Days Of Our Lives) was personally a show I was extremely moved by. It won\'t reach every viewer so well, but from a...strictly technical standpoint it also deserves some serious credit.Story; 10. I can tell you now that I enjoy seeing realism in anime, to a certain extent. Wild shows can be fun too, but we simply don\'t get to see enough anime that has a realistic and relatable plotline and cast. That said, Rumbling Hearts is a show that had realistically shows a group of friends struggles through growing up. The script is really what sells it, and I am happy to say that it\'s written masterfully. I really was caught off guard by the quality of the writing, because as good as some shows are, you can really feel the cheese in the dialogue; This was not an issue here, and there were character monologues that carried the characters above simple representations of human suffering for me on many occasions. I can\'t stress enough how well written this is. The script alone would make a good novel.Art; 9. It\'s a small bit aged by now, but the art is still good. The color palette is nice, the girls are cute too, and not in a Yoko way where I can tell they are simply TOO hot to ever exist. It was a nice change (though I do love me some Yoko. She can save my earth any day, even though I know she never will cause she\'s a cartoon ;__;) All in all, good art. Oh, and the DVD boxart inside is very very nice!Sound; 8. This was iffy. On few, but existant occasions, the sound caught my ear and all I could think was ""wow. bad music."" However, most background BGM isn\'t intended to be FREAKING GREAT MAN, and this was far from the worst. So, I only docked it two points.Character; 10. Takayuki, as stated before, is pretty much me. I was so infuriated at his struggle, and only moreso when I really thought about how I would have made the same mistakes as him myself. He\'s relatable to anyone who avoids things, is indecisive and feels responsibility, and loyalty to everyone around, but doesn\'t know who to be most loyal to. And if this describes you, like myself, you\'re going to really get a kick in the gut from Rumbling Hearts. This characters power is enhanced a tenfold by a supporting cast that I am sure other fans will relate with. They were all o well done, and I really applaud the script for allowing this amazing characterization to take place.Enjoyment/Overall; 9. This show is nothing new, but is so well done that it may as well be. Much like Welcome To The NHK, the stunning realism that applied to me personally really got to me, and this is a show I know I\'ll never watch again but will also never forget. It\'s powerful stuff, so drama fans should not turn up this glistening jewel. strictly technical standpoint it also deserves some serious credit.Story; 10.

I was pleasantly surprised by the characters and their lives as well as the hilarious scenes presented. Still I became greatly disappointed of the story\'s development. Of all the ends they could choose, they picked one of the worst.You are wondering why I say this.. well I will relay a hint without writing spoilers.The story, a good one at that, is about a pig a whore and a pure hearted girl.

Thank you for your attention', 'Allow me to preface this post by stating that I never expected to even tolerate, let alone thoroughly enjoy, Rumbling Hearts when I first began my 14 episode adventure. Rumbling Hearts is a drama/romance series from 2003 that was directed by Tetsuya Watanabe and Studio Fantasia. So what originally drew me to this series you might ask? And to that, I don’t have much of an answer. It all honestly, I started this series because I was in the mood for a romance series and found this one by chance and began it on a total whim. The studio is one I have never heard...of, the director has done nothing of merit (in my opinion at least), it’s dated, and it has a completely mediocre score on MAL. I actually find that starting completely random series can be a fun adventure all on its own simply because you have no expectations heading into the series, but that is a tangent for another day.So the real question is, why did I enjoy it? Now that is a question I can answer! To put it simply, this is a series that, for me, had everything I desire in a solid, nail-biting drama: originality, unpredictability, and a well-developed (albeit incredibly flawed) cast of characters.Caution: I do want to mention that I will have to reveal minor spoilers about the series (nothing major of course) to be able to discuss the series, so I wanted to throw a quick warning out there!The story itself revolves around four friends, originally set in a high school setting that later changes to an adult setting after a three year time skip. This premise by itself sets itself apart from other anime of its kind. It was a breath of fresh air to see a romance that, while it began in high school, is primarily set in adulthood. In terms of originality, Rumbling Hearts doesn’t stop there. Throughout the course of the series (again minor spoilers ahead), Takayuki becomes involved in a committed relationship with both of the lead heroines. This is able to occur because the first heroine he dates winds up in a tragic accident while back in high school and remains comatose for three years. This ends up developing many of the central themes of the series: friendship, betrayal, guilt, jealousy, and love. The premise is an incredibly difficult one to navigate properly without delving into the overly dramatic; however, Rumbling Hearts does so in a magnificent fashion. Even when the story seems to brim on the absurd, every character is justified in their actions (at least in their own minds) and acts according to the character motivations that have been developed throughout the series. This series is unafraid to dive into new territory and it truly sets it apart from other anime of its kind.In terms of unpredictability, the series manages to keep the outcome a complete toss-up. By showing Takayuki with both of the lead heroines, we are able to imagine him in a scenario where he could end up with either one. By keeping the outcome a mystery, it truly keeps the entire series fresh and interesting because I was eager to see which way Takayuki would lean. This also causes Takayuki as a character to struggle because he realizes that, no matter the outcome, someone will end up damaged and hurt by the result. The series takes many twists and turns throughout that added an overall element of unpredictability to the plot.The characters in Rumbling Hearts are incredibly flawed people. I would even argue that a majority of them (all for except maybe one) are selfish and mostly self-serving, despite what they admit to themselves. Although, I do not hold this as a negative toward the series, I actually regard it as a positive. These characters felt fresh and original. They may not have had fun personalities, but they felt different because they felt far more real than the usual one-dimensional goody two shoes we usually see in romance series. Each character is, at times, self-serving and makes choices that hurt others. These are flawed people and it allows them to grow as characters, recognize their mistakes, and learn from them in the end. Again, this is another way that Rumbling Hearts manages to really drive home the themes of jealously, betrayal, and guilt. Each character goes through a transformation of sorts and ends up a wholly different person from the beginning of the series to its end. For example, Takayuki goes from someone who is indecisive because he wants to be kind to everyone and never wants to let anyone down, but realizes how his indecision is hurting the people around him. Takayuki eventually becomes a character that is able to make decisions and follow through upon them because he realizes that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone is let them go. Each character goes through this type of metamorphose and eventually ends up a different character come the conclusion because they learn from their experiences. Characters will make mistakes throughout this series because people make mistakes in real life. I was thoroughly impressed by the evolution of each of the characters, something I never expected going into the series.Perhaps a large reason of why I was so impressed by Rumbling Hearts is because I never expected to actually be impressed by it. Does this series border on the ridiculous at times? Absolutely. It is anime after all. The parts revolving around the accident and comatose state are exaggerated; however, this was something I was easily able to look past because they explained it well enough and followed through on their reasoning. People also seem to take issue with the conclusion at times, mostly because it doesn’t end in a fashion that a lot of people expected it to. I for one give this series props for remaining unpredictable all the way through to the dramatic conclusion.This series is by no means perfect, but I enjoyed myself tremendously on this roller coaster ride of drama. Rumbling Hearts was original and unpredictable. It was unpredictable from a story perspective as well as unpredictable in the sense that I never would have predicted how much I would enjoy this series when I first started. In my opinion, this series incredibly underrated and if you are looking for something different than the norm, I highly recommend you give this hidden gem a shot. of, the director has done nothing of merit (in my opinion at least), it’s dated, and it has a completely mediocre score on MAL.

Robert\'s Too Late Reviews once again coming your way! This time we\'re looking at a doozy with this one! This series really pulls me in many different directions, and to be honest, half of me wants to give it a 6 or 7, and the other half wants to give it a 9 or even a 10. I just come away from it so conflicted and full of questions, yet still finding myself thinking about the series, which says something about my emotional investment in the show. So I do recommend this series to you guys, but know there\'s a big point or two...that can affect your enjoyment, and that I\'m not exactly a fan of the ending, even though it did make sense to me. Will the RTLR wall of heartbreak get more covered? Let\'s take off at this thing like we were about to be hit by a car!Story: 8There\'s a spoiler that *has* to be discussed when it comes to this anime, and if you\'ve even glanced at any other reviews or such you likely know already: the tragedy mentioned in the synopsis is one girl getting hit by a car and slipping into a years long coma. This is important because there requires a large dose of logic leaping to support the story. This character, one of the love interests, regains consciousness after 3 years of being in a coma, her doctor decides it is in her best interest for everyone to keep the amount of time she\'s been out a secret to her. This is the setting for much of the dramatic content, and we absolutely have to accept this or else the whole thing falls apart.The issue is, however, that most of realize that this is by no means realistic. I\'ve never worked a hospital when I was a young man in the medical field, but I have worked many nursing homes with patients experiencing different forms of dementia. We were instructed to gently remind patients of where they were along with *when*. Now in practice we rarely held to this procedure as it tends to just upset the poor people, but it was even protocol in the old folks\' homes I\'ve been in. To believe a doctor in a hospital with a young patient would want everyone around her to lie to her is a little bit of  a stretch.She also is a little slow on the uptake, the young woman. She doesn\'t notice obvious changes in everyone around her that would indicate that it had been more than a few weeks since she was injured. While her parents might not look *too* much different, her little sister grows into a young woman in the time of her coma, and young ladies make some VERY obvious biological changes in their bodies during that age, to be delicate about it. Not to mention, the young woman does not notice for what seems to be a very long time that her hair is a great deal longer than before, and that she has lost a lot of weight in the in between. If you cannot accept that lying to a patient and not disclosing something so huge immediately is acceptable medical practices, then this is going to bug you to the point you\'ll likely not get any enjoyment from the series. This is a constant and central theme to the entire thing. This is what causes part of me to want to give a lower score.If you can roll with this punch, then you\'ll find a compelling story about a guy and two girls who are thrust by fate into a terrible situation and how they come to overcome and understand their true feelings. The gist of it is basically a girl (coma girl) wants to meet a boy (the MC) and so has her friend (the other girl in the situation) snuggle up to him and get to know him so that she can have a way \'in\' and meet him herself. This approach works, as the \'other girl\' does befriend the MC, and introduces the coma girl, who quickly confesses her feelings. The \'other girl\' and the MC have eyes for each other, but have nothing concrete. For the sake of her friend, \'other girl\' encourages the MC to date her. They are not together long, though they hit some major relationship milestones in that short time, before the accident happens. What follows is the story of a man that believes himself to be responsible for what happened to coma girl, and the guilt that wracks him and his life. Not knowing when, or even if, the coma girl would ever be who she once was, he begins to fall apart. The \'other girl\' is there, and helps him pick himself up in his time of need. Their interest in each other blooms into a full blown relationship and moves forward to the point of them considering living together. Yet, as this milestone for the couple rapidly approaches, coma girl suddenly wakes up, and believes herself to still be the high school girl dating the MC. This brings the MC back around to his guilt and feelings he had, only now he doesn\'t know who to turn to, who to love, and which way his life should go. Does he cling to the girl of his past? Or does he continue to move forward with the girl that helped him through that dark part of his life?Throw in the obvious repercussions that come with coma girl\'s friend being the one the MC moved on with, the sense of betrayal just being invited in there, and mix that with a little sister that has only a part of the whole picture whose feelings are involved too, and you end up with a bit of a mess. The MC is hated on by many, but I truly recommend giving him a shot before passing judgement. I think he\'s really trying his best to be kind to everyone, the series itself points this out, and he just wants to do well by everyone involved, but there\'s no easy way out of the situation. He isn\'t an ass, he\'s a guy that has been caught in a serious bind by fate. He can\'t really bring himself to dump the coma girl, I mean, damn how cold do you have to be to break up with someone in that condition? Though it would have been probably for the best, he doesn\'t hate the girl, in fact he blames himself for her even being there in the first place. He just wants to do right by her. But by doing so, he has to deal with the feelings he\'s causing in the \'other girl\'.The tale follows the lines laid by those events, as hearts are broken, feelings are crushed, and souls left to yearn over what might have been, or for what could still be. It\'s an intense journey where you sometimes want to scream at the screen for him to do a certain thing with a certain one of the girls, yet if you sit back and think, you might find yourself feeling I do, that more than anything I\'m glad I\'m not him, as I couldn\'t have gotten out of the situation either without hurting someone. And the MC, like so many of us, just really wants to keep from doing that very thing: hurting either of the girls. Yet sometimes when you try to save the world, you end up saving no one.The story made me gasp a few times, beg the characters to do or not do certain things, and even misted up my eyes a few times as you realize there are no true \'bad guys\' in the situation, just people having feelings and trying to live through them without hurting the people they care about most. I think about the situations, and I tell ya, I can understand how the MC was just trying to spare everyone\'s feelings, but in his indecisiveness he ended up doing the very thing he was trying to avoid. As he is told, sometimes being kind is cruel. Fitting.If you have no interest in feelings or that kind of thing, obviously pass. This isn\'t high school based either, no matter what some of the pictures portray. The majority of the events happen well after graduating, though coma girl for a long while isn\'t aware of this. This has a real world feeling to it, and has real world reactions. It isn\'t a simple thing, to untangle the feelings involved, the guilt, the feelings of responsibility, the desire for what the heart truly wants, and how love grows, regardless of all of those things at times. It is gripping, saddening at times, and triumphant at others. This is the part of me that wants to grade the score higher.Art: 7This is old school, through and through. We\'re talking about a series that ended, what, 15 years ago? Of course it looks old because it *is* old. The classic style art is fine, it just is that: classic styled. Which was the in thing to do back in those days. There\'s nothing wrong with the art at all, I\'m just honestly not a fan. I didn\'t find anything to detract from it per se, I just have a harder time with older titles, and this is no exception. I find art to be highly subjective, so don\'t let this particular section hold too much influence. I do admit I did lose the sense of watching animation especially as I got deeper into the series.Sound: 7The sound effects are well done. The voice acting is very pleasing to the ear. I think I found Akane\'s voice work very interesting, as she seemed to be the one to carry the most anger (with one humorous exception) and when she lashes out, it sounds right to me. The MC is a little wishy washy sounding, but that fits because most of what he says is wishy washy, as that\'s kind the core of his character, his desire to shield everyone somehow. The coma girl sounds younger than the \'other girl\' via the use of a higher pitched voice actor. That was a good call, as the more mature girl gives a great performance as well. The only oddity would be the \'other girl\'s older sounding voice in the few early episodes, but firstly we\'re not in that time frame long enough to notice, and secondly, it\'s not that obvious until later. I didn\'t catch the use of tone of voice to augment the story of \'lost time\' until nearly the end of the series. I just was a bit impressed when I realized the way they even used voices to illustrate the time element of the story. The only thing that is a little grating is the voice of a coworker the MC works with at the diner, and that\'s on purpose as a comedic relief character.The background music is nice and floaty, as you would expect from a fairly serious romance series. The piano work is nice, and the themes fit well enough. I don\'t think I\'ll play them without watching the series, but they weren\'t out of place by any means.Enjoyment: 8I really found myself invested in this show, especially as it came to a close. There is a slight bit of slow pacing in the beginning, even a little close to halfway through, but after the \'other girl\' starts to come undone, it really steams forward to the ending. I found myself wanting to do the old \'one more episode\' so that\'s always an indication that I\'m wrapped up in the story. The only thing that gets me, and if you have ever read any of my reviews you can likely guess what I\'m about to say, is the ending. There is a level of ambiguity to the ending that drove me to near madness. The girl he ends up with is heavily implied, but not clearly stated, as far as I\'m concerned. It had what I consider a more \'muted\' ending. I would have LOVED to have it ending with a wedding, but it was not to be. I love grand romantic statements and movements, but as I\'ve said before, I think that\'s a cultural thing. It seems here in the west (in my part of America at least) a desire to see the \'happily ever after\' stated plainly. We seem to live for that moment the lovers run into each other\'s arms and fall to their knees kissing in the rain. Eastern cultures, in anime at least, seems to end more often on a note that is much quieter and introspective.That\'s fine of course, it is just the difference on how people in different cultures see things. The Eastern cultures seem to be far more adept with the idea of all things having a time and place, and eventually an end. We Westerners seem far more into \'love is forever\' and that kind of tenacious holding onto what we love. So there\'s no \'chick-flick\' ending, but the ending we are given is acceptable. I just wanted to see something \'bigger\'.My problem is that of the \'romantic\' anime when I first started watching was that I stumbled across Strawberry Panic, which DOES have the grand ending. Ended up setting my expectations to something that doesn\'t seem to happen so often in the rest of anime. I\'ll get over it, I still loved the story and will accept the ending given. Begrudgingly, however!Best Girl: Daikuuji Ayu, the waitress from the diner where the MC works that is constantly screaming obscenities at the MC. My favorite? ""I hope you step in cat shit!"" If I had to be completely serious, I would say Akane, as a good deal of her issues is sadly because she\'s not informed of everything going on, which is very sad because those things pain her a great deal.I say spin this one, and for sure watch episode 4 before passing judgement as after the accident there is a huge shift in the way things go down. This is a story about pain and loss, and how people react and move on, and of course what happens when everything you thought you\'d gotten over comes back into your life like a hurricane. I think many of us would try to do right by everyone like our MC does, but I pray we would meet with more success than he did. To quote the incomparable Alice Cooper: ""Love is a loaded gun"". I say let your heart rumble! Thumbs up, though no new RTLR wall entries. See you guys for the OVA! that can affect your enjoyment, and that I\'m not exactly a fan of the ending, even though it did make sense to me. Will the RTLR wall of heartbreak get more covered?

The Eastern cultures seem to be far more adept with the idea of all things having a time and place, and eventually an end. We Westerners seem far more into \'love is forever\' and that kind of tenacious holding onto what we love. So there\'s no \'chick-flick\' ending, but the ending we are given is acceptable. I just wanted to see something \'bigger\'.My problem is that of the \'romantic\' anime when I first started watching was that I stumbled across Strawberry Panic, which DOES have the grand ending. Ended up setting my expectations to something that doesn\'t seem to happen so often in the rest of anime. I\'ll get over it, I still loved the story and will accept the ending given. Begrudgingly, however!Best Girl: Daikuuji Ayu, the waitress from the diner where the MC works that is constantly screaming obscenities at the MC. My favorite? ""I hope you step in cat shit!"" If I had to be completely serious, I would say Akane, as a good deal of her issues is sadly because she\'s not informed of everything going on, which is very sad because those things pain her a great deal.I say spin this one, and for sure watch episode 4 before passing judgement as after the accident there is a huge shift in the way things go down. This is a story about pain and loss, and how people react and move on, and of course what happens when everything you thought you\'d gotten over comes back into your life like a hurricane. I think many of us would try to do right by everyone like our MC does, but I pray we would meet with more success than he did. To quote the incomparable Alice Cooper: ""Love is a loaded gun"". I say let your heart rumble! Thumbs up, though no new RTLR wall entries. See you guys for the OVA!', ""Ah, wow. This truly was an amazing anime. I doubt I could find any little thing to complain about while watching it... Except for one thing. It kept me awake watching episode after episode, and I ended up failing a math test due to lack of sleep. But, hey, that's just a testament to how great this series is.Anyway, I'll start with the characters and their personalities.I personally loved every single character in the anime. From the minor Daiikuji-chan to the four main characters, I enjoyed watching every one of them. Especially when combined with the absolutely beautiful and heartwarming storyline, the characters were...absolutely wonderful, in almost every way.The storyline, however, is where this anime really shines. I found myself crying for at least 3 hours, in a row. It was so amazingly dramatic and sad, yet, at the end, let everything turn out acceptably. So many scenes caused me to cry, which is a great thing. ^_^ Truly wonderful.The opening song, is a little upbeat, but not to an extreme extent, and, although is a bit contrasting to most of the storyline, is very nice. However, the ending, and the final episode ending perfectly captured the essence of the anime with it's slow, peaceful, yet somewhat sad sounding tune. All the background music fit perfectly, further bringing out the soul and feeling of the already-dramatic storyline.All in all, this anime was amazing in all ways...

At first glance , i thought its about two girls that love two boys (you know who i was reffering to) but nope . I was wrong . Its actually more than that .

Not to mention Suzumiya Haruka , the sleeping beauty . It seem she is the type of shy girl person for me . After the event that happen to her , i won't lie that i cry . We also got Haruka little sister , Akane , Takayuki best friend guy , Shinji and some other characters . It seem that i love Daikuuji and Mayu personalities .

For a romance series you\'d expect a lot of the usual high-school (I like you but I\'m to shy to admit it moment). A really shallow and somewhat cliche archetype that\'s hard to escape.

I hated it because this route turned almost every single character into one of the most hated characters (at least) in my list and it just made me furious!

It doesnt have dull moments or pointless filler. However, just...because I rate the story highly... its an awful story. I hate what happens. Not that the story is written poorly, its just that I can not stand what is happening. Similar to an anime like School Days or Clannad... where you dislike what is happening or what is happening to the characters but it is INTERESTING and you cant put it down. So I just want to get that straight... the story is 10/10 but what goes on inside the story is SO crappy, and I hated it.Art: 7/10It's fairy cute with a strong 2000s vibe - as it should as a 2003 anime. It's not awful and I enjoyed it (I love that 2000s art after all) but its nothing to hype over.Sound: 6/10Soundtrack is pretty much just background noise. It's alright, and pretty expected of the 2003 anime, but nothing special. I wouldnt mind listening to the soundtrack over again though.Character: 9/10Theres three main characters. I wont say who is who... but... One I LOVE. This character is perfect all around and enjoyable and likeable. The other two are disgusting and I hate for different reasons. HOWEVER, just because they are bad people doesnt mean they didn't play their role perfectly in this romantic drama, which they did. The reason horrible things happened in this anime was because of these two... no they didn't kill anyone lol. The characters are well developed and are solid characters... I just don't like them because of what they do. You'll know who is who after a while.

I just want you to bear in mind that when you watch this anime, that you learn the most important lesson of all: DO NOT GIVE UP ON A PERSON THAT IS IN A COMMA! I really wanted all to end right but it did not. I don't understand any of the logic. How can one be so weak, stupid, pathetic lie Takayuki???? O_o I did notice that he lacks big time religion, a key point that has helped me more than anything. My personal opinion is...do not screw over your first love because I will be watching every single one of you cause in real life I am a priest of the Necronomicon. Ok, all the above was personal comments and now the review with a professional style. The art is very beautiful. All the side stories add to comprehension, comedy and depth of this anime. The music was good, especially the karaoke of the opening song. Enjoyment was good but was freaked by the accident. Story is similar to ef- A Tales of Memories but there are just some similarities. Overall it is good but weak people will be pissed at many things. By the way if I see a guy like Takayuki and learn of this, I swear I will curse or beat the crap out of him.

Develop the personality of 3 young adults and 1 adolescentis not an easy task, and the anime made it very well. Many different things that they had to face on that difficult stage of life were reproduced, the emotional part being focused. The core of the story was the development by the three protagonists of feelings that are, at the same time, immoral and undeniable. These desires erupt and evolve right when the characters are more emotional unstable, which leads to a situation that is impossible to solve without hurting...everyone\'s feelings. All the hesitation and slow-paced decision making is pretty coherent with the context and it builds an agony on the viewer, which fuels our engines to reach to the ending of the show. Moreover, the anime made a good job on immersion because of the realistic touch on its writing.Art: 8The art was good, but not perfect. Haruka and Mitsuki emotions could be felt by the drawing, but I found it lacking on Takayuki, that had quite of a poker face. The enviroments were nice and other characters were good too. I liked the realistics proportions of the people too.Easter Egg:Many characters arts, names and personalities were used in the visual novel Muv-Luv.Sound: 7The music was pleasant and the voice acting was average (many japanese stereotypes). However the quality of the sound did not jeopardize the experience, but did not add too much either.Character: 8The character development in a realistic world is the center of the show, since it is a slice of life. The romance flows with one story core, from where emerge the conflicts (almost all of them emotional) that must be solved by the characters. Takayuki was portrayed as a really kind person, and that kindness was reflected on his ability to put effort on others beyond the level of a medium human being, at the same time, his empathy put him in several tough situations, because he did not want to hurt the people he loved, which led him to dwell too much on his conflicts. He was also a hardworking guy and could control his emotions while was working, which demonstrate that he cared about his coworkers as well. Mitsuki was portrayed as the most emotional character, in my opinion, her feelings drove her to make some silly decisions that led to some bad situations, but to others that were good. The strenght of her love was heart melting, which made her face many disgraces for the welfare of the man she loves, and that factor made her my favorite character, despite the fact that her emotional spikes caused the most revolting situations in the show. Haruka did not have so much attention as the others, her interaction with the other characters were the fuel to the plot, since the conflicts were originated from there, but she had almost no decision making until the last episodes, but her influence was necessary to move the anime to the end. She was, at most times, very affectionate and shy. However she demonstrated strenght to deal with her conflicts.Enjoyment: 9It was very good to see the classic battle ""Platonic Infantile Love X Realistic Adult Love"" portrayed in a different way.

The Development of the tragedy was well made and proved to be realistic and heart warming. everyone\'s feelings. All the hesitation and slow-paced decision making is pretty coherent with the context and it builds an agony on the viewer, which fuels our engines to reach to the ending of the show. Moreover, the anime made a good job on immersion because of the realistic touch on its writing.Art: 8The art was good, but not perfect. Haruka and Mitsuki emotions could be felt by the drawing, but I found it lacking on Takayuki, that had quite of a poker face. The enviroments were nice and other characters were good too. I liked the realistics proportions of the people too.Easter Egg:Many characters arts, names and personalities were used in the visual novel Muv-Luv.Sound: 7The music was pleasant and the voice acting was average (many japanese stereotypes). However the quality of the sound did not jeopardize the experience, but did not add too much either.Character: 8The character development in a realistic world is the center of the show, since it is a slice of life.

All three of these are highly controversial works due to a simple powerful emotion that they evoke in the audience. Anger. The reason countless people give them shoddy ratings isn't due to poor writing. Because the writing isn't poor. Any writing that can evoke such a powerful emotional response from the audience cannot be poor. The reason people dislike this feeling is because it reminds them of the cruel unrelenting nature of this world that will kick you when you're down. Part of the reason...people enjoy watching anime, is because it offers them an escape path from all of that.

It's one of only a few anime that I've seen that is really good with such a serious and melancholic tone to it. "", ""Story:I would have to give the story a 7. Don't get me wrong, I love the story, but it is a typical soap opera story line. Once I started thinking in those terms, it kind of spoiled the story a bit. I will say though, it was a good heart wrenching anime. I can (probably) say that we've all felt as Haruka, Mitsuki, or Kakayuki did at one point and time in our lives. I was able to relate rather well to a few of the characters throughout the series.Art:I love the art, I've always loved the shojou art, but there isn't anything that really...seriously sticks out to me that could bump my opinion up to a 9 or 10.

There wasn't a real way that you could side with one character over the other if you've ever felt the feelings they've felt. The only problem I had with the characters, is there were supporting characters and they played some purpose, but not much. Haruka's sister was there to push the guilt trips, the high school friend of the three (Can't recall his name) was there as a kind of wake up call to Takayuki and Mitsuki, but frankly, the girls Takayuki worked with, had a very little to no purpose in the anime except to get a few laughs from.Enjoyment:It was a good anime to pass time with.

That is not to say the anime is boring, but rather, a lot of the pacing and developments in the story can be seen coming a mile away. Sadly, therein lies the problem: while the conflict that arises is indeed predictable, the responses from the characters can only be considered obnoxious and pathetic. This leaves the viewer quite bored towards the end of the series, after the same characters behave the same...selfish way episode after episode. The main issue of the story is the way in which the cast of characters responds to the love triangle between the three main characters. During high school, best friends Mitsuki and Haruka both have developed a crush on a boy called Takayuki. However, Mitsuki only developed this love after she deliberately became friends with Takayuki in order to help Haruka break the ice between the two so she could confess to him. Although this is a major source of conflict in the story, Mitsuki seemingly announces her feelings to Takayuki out of nowhere. This is foreshadowing of Haruka’s selfish nature that will cause the implosion of the love between Haruka and Takayuki. Soon after this secret confession the love between Haruka and Takayuki blossoms beautifully. It can be argued that if this story became focused on Mitsuki's development as a person experiencing the pain of jealousy and loss, then this story might've been much more adored than what it resorts to being: a story about betrayal. While waiting for Takayuki near some telephones, Haruka is hit by a bus while she was attempting to contact Takayuki, who was running late. This accident leaves her in a coma where it is uncertain if she will ever wake up again. Meanwhile, Takayuki begins to feel guilty, as he was late to the rendezvous because Mitsuki was holding him up. Mitsuki gained wind that he was on a date with Haruka, and begins pressuring him to buy her a present due to her birthday, when in actuality she was jealous of the date he was going on with Haruka. Right away, the poison in the story is administered and has a displeasing effect on the viewing experience. While Takayuki is in distress over his failure, Mitsuki seizes this oppurtunity to seduce Takayuki, only seeing Haruka's accident as her key to victory for her love. Instead of questioning the validity of Mitsuki's feelings, or whether or not it is the right decision to make in such a situation, he gives into Mitsuki when she throws her body in his arms. This is only the beginning of the toxic events that begin to unravel. The story continues until it reaches the main center of conflict which is Haruka's awakening. The couple attempt to hide their relationship from Haruka, but it begins to devolve into mistrust and uncertainty. Instead of addressing the situation head on, the characters constantly brush off the weight of the circumstance, only leading the emotions to boil over until brash decisions are made, like Mitsuki sleeping with her best friend or Takayuki going for days ignoring Mitsuki. The characters almost refuse to act like adults and share accountability for the relationship. Conflict after conflict only leads to recurrences of anger and self-hatred. While it is understandable the show has a duty to be entertaining by way of creating interesting conflicts, the story tries to convince the audience subconsciously that the illegitimate love between Mitsuki and Takayuki is valid, if only because they got together when Haruka was in a coma. While the writers have no responsibility to preach morals, the lack of dialogue on the topic of betrayal causes a feeling of bewilderment to arise in the viewer while the series concludes. The question of whether it is truly acceptable to betray a promise and trust between best friends is completely ignored for the themes of acceptance and self-improvement. This leaves a sense of dissatisfaction, as the ending while beautiful only contradicts this message to reaffirm what it has been trying to communicate the entire show: a love gained through opportunity is not wrong, and worthwhile if you need it to survive. While this message is not terrible, the story contradicts this sentiment towards the end of the series. While Takayuki sees Haruka and the feelings he possessed so long ago begin to reignite, Mitsuki finds the strength to let go of their toxic relationship and pursues growing as an adult. Haruka, being feeble and timid her whole life, finds a burning desire to grow stronger for Takayuki's sake and works hard to heal after for him. But as the final episodes come, Haruka's feelings are betrayed by Takayuki for a final time, and all the progress that the characters have made is undone. And by the end of the anime, it only seems that Haruka grew as a person throughout the whole series, while Takayuki and Mitsuki resign themselves to their relationship, as they admit that they could not persevere alone, and not only love but need one another. While this is a very romantic idea, it completely diminishes the improvement of the characters, as they worked so hard for the sake of progression but ended up staying with each other to protect themselves from suffering alone. Ultimately, Rumbling Hearts is a product of it's source material, and by design it is meant to possess various endings. However, the ending the writers choice to use when adopting this concept can only be described as hopelessly romantic. selfish way episode after episode.

Just because I thought that something was better than you thought or worse than you thought, doesn\'t mean that I did a ""Bad review"". If I did a ""Bad Review"" than I wouldn\'t have cared to make a review in the firstplace. Also, I can understand if I might have said something that offended you, upset you, or whatever, but I literally can\'t quite help...that. I certainly can make a review that deserves ""Constructive Criticism"", but I certainly don\'t intend on EVER making a ""Bad Review"" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.In English, it is known as ""Rumbling Hearts."" Its a romance anime that likes to take a look into relationships among friends and how they play off each other. Now, I have seen this at least one other time, and honestly, I thought it was pretty bad, but that was about 6 years ago. I rewatched it again but didn\'t finish it, and then about a year ago, I watched it again, and I loved it. Why all this change? Well, for one, I couldn\'t relate to them years ago, but now that I am older, the changes they made also I can relate to, so here we go, Rumbling Hearts.The Story is about how 4 friends grow in their friendship, struggle with their friendship, until one of them succumbs to an accident, and they all were never the same again. Now, It may not seem like a good romance anime, but each of these people are unique, in the sense that they develop almost like real people and they go through semi-real struggles. Now, I don\'t quite understand why 14 episodes, because it seems that they fleshed out some things, and they should have just done a 24-ish length instead of making it this confusing, but it was a very well done story, even if some things don\'t seem right. (8/10)The art wasn\'t spectacular, but it was VERY good for its time. For anime that  have appeared around this time, it is definitely very well done visually. This is also a year, where it is transitioning between the older styles, like Berserk and even older anime have been in to a more modern style with some modern effects. Now, it isn\'t even the best of its time, but it definitely is definitely up there, in terms of visuals. (8/10)The music and such wasn\'t too great, but it wasn\'t even mediocre. It had a nice ambiance, which really did well at the very least keeping me entertained and keeping me VERY interested in the story and everything else. (7/10)Now, the characters were actually better than I expected them to be, since it is a romance anime. Now, I don\'t think that these characters are better than Clannad\'s characters, but I didn\'t finish Clannad at all, so I can\'t really judge it wholeheartedly. It mostly revolves around the 4 main characters, two males and two females, who have some wierd and convoluted love rectangle go on, which helps to add interesting twists. Mitsuki is definitely my favorite of the two women, and she goes through some tough emotional stuff with Takayuki, the main male lead. Now, the only character that I don\'t particularly like is Takayuki\'s best guy friend, Shinji Taira, but he is more of a supporting character overall, despite being important to the development of Takayuki and Mitsuki. (7/10)Overall, this anime was definitely better after watching it a number of times, but it definitely could have been played better. It definitely was a very enjoyable anime to watch and its one of those anime that you have to see, as a rival to Clannad, and no, I am not trying to say that it is better, because I haven\'t finished Clannad, and nor am I going to finish it for awhile. that. I certainly can make a review that deserves ""Constructive Criticism"", but I certainly don\'t intend on EVER making a ""Bad Review"" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.In English, it is known as ""Rumbling Hearts."" Its a romance anime that likes to take a look into relationships among friends and how they play off each other. Now, I have seen this at least one other time, and honestly, I thought it was pretty bad, but that was about 6 years ago. I rewatched it again but didn\'t finish it, and then about a year ago, I watched it again, and I loved it. Why all this change? Well, for one, I couldn\'t relate to them years ago, but now that I am older, the changes they made also I can relate to, so here we go, Rumbling Hearts.The Story is about how 4 friends grow in their friendship, struggle with their friendship, until one of them succumbs to an accident, and they all were never the same again. Now, It may not seem like a good romance anime, but each of these people are unique, in the sense that they develop almost like real people and they go through semi-real struggles. Now, I don\'t quite understand why 14 episodes, because it seems that they fleshed out some things, and they should have just done a 24-ish length instead of making it this confusing, but it was a very well done story, even if some things don\'t seem right. (8/10)The art wasn\'t spectacular, but it was VERY good for its time. For anime that  have appeared around this time, it is definitely very well done visually. This is also a year, where it is transitioning between the older styles, like Berserk and even older anime have been in to a more modern style with some modern effects. Now, it isn\'t even the best of its time, but it definitely is definitely up there, in terms of visuals. (8/10)The music and such wasn\'t too great, but it wasn\'t even mediocre. It had a nice ambiance, which really did well at the very least keeping me entertained and keeping me VERY interested in the story and everything else. (7/10)Now, the characters were actually better than I expected them to be, since it is a romance anime. Now, I don\'t think that these characters are better than Clannad\'s characters, but I didn\'t finish Clannad at all, so I can\'t really judge it wholeheartedly. It mostly revolves around the 4 main characters, two males and two females, who have some wierd and convoluted love rectangle go on, which helps to add interesting twists. Mitsuki is definitely my favorite of the two women, and she goes through some tough emotional stuff with Takayuki, the main male lead. Now, the only character that I don\'t particularly like is Takayuki\'s best guy friend, Shinji Taira, but he is more of a supporting character overall, despite being important to the development of Takayuki and Mitsuki. (7/10)Overall, this anime was definitely better after watching it a number of times, but it definitely could have been played better.

MY Goddess. But this one is certainly on par to be up there with those other two mentioned.The emotions are strong and realistic, and it is the most adult story I have come across, i was hooked from Ep2.The only thing which lets it down is the resturant scenes...where the male character works as a floor manager, the two waitresses maybe wearing nice outfits but that's all you really see, a blonde one shouting at customers, arguing with the floor manager and her mouth being pulled apart, it would be better without them! where the male character works as a floor manager, the two waitresses maybe wearing nice outfits but that's all you really see, a blonde one shouting at customers, arguing with the floor manager and her mouth being pulled apart, it would be better without them!"", ""rumbling hearts. just watched it a little while ago and this really made me fucking sad and depressed as hell in a good way, this is pretty refreshing to me haven't watch an anime that is pretty moving and at the same time a story close to real life.rumbling hearts is an anime that  reminds me of how being an adult really fucks you up so bad and events in your life that you think is irrelevant at first could drastically change your life and shape you to a whole new person. plus it reminds me that the past will bite you in...the ass.[spoiler=review and reactions]synopsis:rumbling hearts revolves around 4 ordinary students.Narumi - really nice guy. kind but too kind. guy that i'm sympathetic with. you won't get a hint of douchebaggery on him. his put with so much shit that he completely becomes insane in some pointMitsuki - athletic beautiful long haired girl. many guys courts her but he all refused them.

I think the story could have been cut down a tad bit because of the continuous repitition of how sad one...of the girls were to learn that the guy has perhaps still harbour some love for his previous girlfriend.Art, nothing to complain about but wasn\'t anything special either.Sound honestly.... well fitting music, nothing out of the ordinary, really well suited to the mood.Characters... this annoyed me to some extent.While trying to stay some what mutual in this review :Since the story revolves mainly around 3 people : 1 guy and 2 girls, theres constant struggles to which one he wants more. Maybe he feels obliged to the one suffering from a coma or is in debt to the girl who has taken care of him, whatever the cause I found him really annoying not seeking any advice having. The girl who has taken care of him in my opinion is a whore...... she has sex with the guy constantly it becomes some what unclear if the guy actually likes her or is using her. Any how this girl apparent to some crowds is annoying because of her lack of mental strength, her tenancy to break into tears, she more fragile than .5mm thick ice!   It is further more hinted that the only reason the guy had gotten into a relationship with this girl during the other\'s coma was because she gave him sexual support which in turn made him want more which probably turned into a relationship.I didn\'t find any problems with the other girl however, (kinda more rooting for her) she considers the guys feelings, and asks him about his life what not and is not only thinking about herself. No problem here.Enjoyment was fair because of how I felt towards the characters and the story, annoyed by the guys lack of strength to face the problem in hand, the girl\'s tenancy to be sooo clingy and how easily she gets upset and distracted.Overall I felt that the anime was really good, why I didn\'t give this a 9 or 10 was because casual the put up the topic of sex and how I felt that eventually the relationship between any of the girls and guys was because the guy wanted to use them as his sex toy. Plus how i felt the anime was a tiny bit dragged on. Honestly I don\'t think the guy deserved either of the girls.This anime is suggested for those who are interested in real life drama instead of the romances with a bit of ""god"" powers where somehow the dead female protagonist comes back alive or how time rewinds.

Neither moving forward nor back? How long would you wait for time to start moving again, how would you decide when it\'s time to move on?The premise to this show is arguably its strongest point - two girls, one guy, he ends up dating one of them with the feelings of the other girl lingering. But in good old RomCom-fashion, she holds back for the sake of the other girl, who is also her beloved friend. But when that girl falls into a coma after an accident and...doesn\'t appear to be waking up again - she decides to support their boy friend throughout the following chaotic storm of emotions. Eventually, after three long years, he decides that it\'s time to move on and starts dating his supportive friend. But then - in an unexpected turn of events, shocking, I know - his girlfriend wakes up from her coma again, unaware of how much time has passed.Please be aware that there will be spoilers from here on out, since most of what I liked about the show directly relates to its story and how the premise is handled.The conflict is very believable (even if the circumstances are certainly convenient). Takayuki, our protagonist, has never had the chance to reconcile with his original girlfriend, Haruka. Their relationship was just sort of interrupted with him being left unable to communicate with her. And we as audience get so see that it\'s not like he gave up on her easily. He went to the hospital to be by Haruka\'s side every day for months, possibly years on end. We can see him slowly losing hope. We can see how it\'s tearing him up from the inside, with his other friend, Mitsuki, patiently staying by his side and caring for him. Eventually, even Haruka\'s parents tell him to stop visiting her because they can see how much it hurts him to see her not getting better. Likewise, we can see how much it hurts Mitsuki, and how she still builds a career and focusses on continuing her life. She keeps on moving whereas Haruka is frozen in time. So naturally, he eventually decides to move forward with Mitsuki.It doesn\'t feel like a dick move. And that\'s an important part of how the story is presented; at no point is anyone acting like an idio or out of a misunderstanding. Sure, there is the character of Harukas little sister Akane who is misguided in many different ways, but even that is understandable. She is a teen in Middle School when the accident happens and clearly has to deal with a lot of her own complicated feelings - some of which are for Takayuki, of course, this was originally a Visual Novel.It creates a natural flow to the story.But speaking of the Visual Novel background of the Anime - that is where the first of quite a few weaknesses come into play. Almost every scene contains two characters talking without much else going on. The animation doesn\'t need to be super exciting for a more subdued tone in a show, but with how super stiff it can be, the Director seemed to have run out of ways to make dialogue scenes interesting to look at.Another problem is the structure and the role of some of the characters. The anime chose to focus on only the two main heroines - which was a very good choice, mind you - but that kind of downgrades some characters cearly having an own route in the game just spouting catchphrases by the side of the road and not much else. Any character backgrounds are only hinted at very, very vaguely, time which could have been better spent fleshing some of its main cast out.Because this is the third and biggest problem; Outside of their role in the story, nobody in this show has any personality. Haruka is the frail, innocent girl that is victim to circumstances, whereas Mitsuki is the person who pretends to be strong, but is doubting herself constantly and is seeking reassurance in a very frail relationship.I like that the characters have lifes outside of the central romance - since they\'re all young working adults and not high-schoolers anymore - but these lifes and occupatiosn tell me nothing about them. During the course of the story, both Mitsuki and Takayuki end up skipping a lot of work, too, or getting there visibly distraught and only making problems for everyone around them. How much patience all of their coworkers have for them - with never really being told the situation these two are in - it feels like the show might as well have been set in school.And the kind of compromised realism continues with Haruka.She wakes up from a 3-year-coma, and is able to perfectly articulate herself again after only one month. Sure, she can\'t walk properly, but then seems perfectly fine with sitting for long stretches of time. It\'s a very ""pretty"" version of a coma aftermath.And I get it, the idea is more than Haruka is ""frozen"" in time. And I don\'t think the show would\'ve been better off for intrudingly showing Haruka being unable to move or speak. But it feels like it\'s making the whole sitauation looking much lighter than it is. It adds to Harukas status as a frail girl that she looks like a pretty doll most of the time and that her doctor insists that everyone keeps the truth from her. You\'d think that a hospital dealing with coma patients would have a therapist or something specialized in slowly preparing her to face reality. It also breaks immersion when you try to imagine what Haruka does all day - we\'re being told that she is not allowed reading since it\'s ""too much of a strain"", but there isn\'t a television or even a radio in her room either. Is she just staring at a wall blankly until someone comes in? I\'m no expert on the subject, but I highly doubt little to no stimulation to the brain will help a recovery process. It makes her feel like a very passive character, and pity aside, makes it hard to root for her sincerely.Admittedly, by the end of the show she does bring her own drive and strength after a supposedly final meeting with Mitsuki and it\'s a beautiful moment. Her final goodbye with Takayuki is also very well done. But for most of the time, she\'s treated more like an obstacle to the romance of Mitsuki and Takayuki, which is a bit of a shame.Now Mitsuki, the ""true"" heroine in this anime, is a different breed and kind of has the opposite arc to Haruka. She starts off accepting of her role as supportive friend to the romance of Haruka and Takayuki, and it\'s kind of pull-and-push with her after the accident. Her whole personality is ""I like Takayuki, but I don\'t want to betray Haruka"". She keeps going through cycles of feeling guilty, warming up to the idea that this whole situation isn\'t her fault and that it\'s okay for her to be with Takayuki, then going back to guilt after Haruka wakes back up, a bit of a possessive streak - arguably due to the massive insecurities her guilt caused, which is believable enough - which leads to her character arc of realizing that Takayuki is her everything, and her leaving him in order to be her own person.Which, would the story go through with that arc, would\'ve been pretty cool, but no, by the end Takayuki begs her to get back together with him because he now realized she\'s truly what he needs. I kind of doubt it would be a happy relationship, given how much guilt Mitsuki still has to deal with. EVery new conflict would sway her again, since Takayuki is also kind of more willing to ignore conflict until they disappear rather than speaking about his feelings openly. It feels like a bit of a cop-out for Mitsuki.And then there\'s Takayuki, and naturally, being a VN-Everyman-Protagonist-Guy, he has the least personality between the three of them. He has a tendency to get really hung up on everything and has no idea what to do with the new situation - with basically two girlfriends. The only other thing with him is being offered a full-time job after only working part-time for a while and him hesitating on whether or not to take the opportunity. Both of these tie into the ""Frozen time vs. moving forward"" motive, but that\'s it. His choice doesn\'t feel like something he makes on his own, but rather a decision made by his two girlfriends. It feels kind of unsatisfying.So at the end of all this, the story did take time to establish everyone\'s feelings really well, not so much anything else about the characters. I enjoyed my time with the show, and I did end up excited for how the story might develop so much that I watched the whole thing in like 3 sittings within a week. But I have no doubt I\'ll forget everyone\'s name as well as most of the story within half a year. It\'s perfectly serviceable, but ultimately, kind of a forgettable show due to its forgettable cast, stiff presentation and basing a good part of its premise on convenient selective logic. doesn\'t appear to be waking up again - she decides to support their boy friend throughout the following chaotic storm of emotions. Eventually, after three long years, he decides that it\'s time to move on and starts dating his supportive friend. But then - in an unexpected turn of events, shocking, I know - his girlfriend wakes up from her coma again, unaware of how much time has passed.Please be aware that there will be spoilers from here on out, since most of what I liked about the show directly relates to its story and how the premise is handled.The conflict is very believable (even if the circumstances are certainly convenient). Takayuki, our protagonist, has never had the chance to reconcile with his original girlfriend, Haruka. Their relationship was just sort of interrupted with him being left unable to communicate with her. And we as audience get so see that it\'s not like he gave up on her easily. He went to the hospital to be by Haruka\'s side every day for months, possibly years on end. We can see him slowly losing hope. We can see how it\'s tearing him up from the inside, with his other friend, Mitsuki, patiently staying by his side and caring for him. Eventually, even Haruka\'s parents tell him to stop visiting her because they can see how much it hurts him to see her not getting better. Likewise, we can see how much it hurts Mitsuki, and how she still builds a career and focusses on continuing her life. She keeps on moving whereas Haruka is frozen in time. So naturally, he eventually decides to move forward with Mitsuki.It doesn\'t feel like a dick move. And that\'s an important part of how the story is presented; at no point is anyone acting like an idio or out of a misunderstanding. Sure, there is the character of Harukas little sister Akane who is misguided in many different ways, but even that is understandable. She is a teen in Middle School when the accident happens and clearly has to deal with a lot of her own complicated feelings - some of which are for Takayuki, of course, this was originally a Visual Novel.It creates a natural flow to the story.But speaking of the Visual Novel background of the Anime - that is where the first of quite a few weaknesses come into play. Almost every scene contains two characters talking without much else going on. The animation doesn\'t need to be super exciting for a more subdued tone in a show, but with how super stiff it can be, the Director seemed to have run out of ways to make dialogue scenes interesting to look at.Another problem is the structure and the role of some of the characters. The anime chose to focus on only the two main heroines - which was a very good choice, mind you - but that kind of downgrades some characters cearly having an own route in the game just spouting catchphrases by the side of the road and not much else. Any character backgrounds are only hinted at very, very vaguely, time which could have been better spent fleshing some of its main cast out.Because this is the third and biggest problem; Outside of their role in the story, nobody in this show has any personality. Haruka is the frail, innocent girl that is victim to circumstances, whereas Mitsuki is the person who pretends to be strong, but is doubting herself constantly and is seeking reassurance in a very frail relationship.I like that the characters have lifes outside of the central romance - since they\'re all young working adults and not high-schoolers anymore - but these lifes and occupatiosn tell me nothing about them. During the course of the story, both Mitsuki and Takayuki end up skipping a lot of work, too, or getting there visibly distraught and only making problems for everyone around them. How much patience all of their coworkers have for them - with never really being told the situation these two are in - it feels like the show might as well have been set in school.And the kind of compromised realism continues with Haruka.She wakes up from a 3-year-coma, and is able to perfectly articulate herself again after only one month. Sure, she can\'t walk properly, but then seems perfectly fine with sitting for long stretches of time. It\'s a very ""pretty"" version of a coma aftermath.And I get it, the idea is more than Haruka is ""frozen"" in time.

The story is very deep and emotionally involving, I found myself angry with the characters at points. Some parts move a bit slow and the ending is disappointing, it still makes a very good story. "", ""Well, I saw this around February, and got interested because I kept seeing the OP (Precious Memories) in the aniMYX segment. What's cool about that fact is the video for the OP gave it a really interesting summary of sorts, for the anime, that is.Well, this anime is based on a visual novel (game) so that already gives you hints of it being injected with quite a bit of drama (and if you're like me, and have seen the video I was talking about, well it gets rather dramatic and heavy quite early on).The story is basically set in three timelines. The first is when...the main characters are still in highschool (me thinks, since they're talking about college and so on). Then after something MAJOR happening, skips on ahead to a few months after that event, and then a looong time after that. (Am I making sense?) Basically, the main characters' lives are all turned upside-down and the dynamics of their relationships with each other are examined, both before and after that really important EVENT. (If you want to know the whole picture, just look for the anime..or game even).I'm really rather impressed since I think the anime conveys the hardships of such a condition/situation pretty well, and it also explores how relationships can be affected by something so traumatic. Also PTSD is explored here (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, I think). Which is also something that made me interested about it. To be honest I liked the flow of the story in this version, as compared to the other one, the OVA: Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ~Next Season~, because I think the latter doesn't end erm...believably.That, and I guess I just like Mitsuki better than Haruka (who shares the name of a rather famous anime character from another entirely different series altogether...brownies for those who guess right :P). the main characters are still in highschool (me thinks, since they're talking about college and so on).

', ""I'm giving this anime a rating of 5, not because I personally feel like it deserves it (honestly I'd like to give it a 1) but because I feel like a 5 is truly representative of what people as a whole think of this show when they watch it. Skimming through the list of reviews you'll find mostly either 9s/10s, maybe some 7s thrown in, and then a lot of 1s and 2s. People will either love it, or absolutely hate it.It all basically comes down to one thing, are you the type of person who loves to root for the underdog, who goes...for the all-truistic self sacrificing heroine, do you want a couple to stay together and end up happily ever after, despite the struggles? Then this show is not for you, you won't find any of that in this show.If you're okay with characters who have no code of ethics or morals and just do what they want, characters who are people pleasers and just all around flawed wrecks of human beings who can't quite deal with life, then you will probably be one of those people who love Rumbling Hearts.If you're looking for a feel good romance anime, with memorable characters then please, watch something else.If you want ridiculous amounts of drama, sex scenes, and less than perfect characters then this is the show for you.Ultimately I watched this show and absolutely hated it, it was one of the first animes I watched, and even though its been a good 5 years since I've watched it, my anger and frustration with this show has not subsided in the least. I guess it's because I'm too much of a romantic, I want people to do the right thing and can't really tolerate people who are selfish and consistently do the wrong thing. I think that is where a lot of the low scores for this anime come from, people who just can't get pass the moral and character flaws of these characters. for the all-truistic self sacrificing heroine, do you want a couple to stay together and end up happily ever after, despite the struggles?

Yeah, this is basically Japanese animated version of one of those.Never in my years of watching anime I had such a problem to finish any show, not even shows which I rated lower then this creation. What Rumbling Hearts does very well is exaggerating situations in order to make fake drama. This fake drama should evoke emotions in audience at any cost only to be dealt in most stupidest way to make you even more angry, sad or anything. As a result, it establishes totally unrealistic wannabe flawless interactions and is losing it’s credibility. Narrative of show...was promising and at first I was really curious about the story, unfortunately execution was so poor mainly in second half, that I even regreted to waste my time on this.STORY: 2/10Pacing of the story is standing on cheap dramatic interactions. No doubt it tries to be unique and aim to more matured audience in terms of not being childish, always happy, not having pitiful problems or being shallow yet, I just didn’t believe almost any of it’s situations because it was overplayed just to make it more dramatic. More so stupidity in which story progresses thanks to it’s even more idiotic characters overshadows all these efforts. Setting of the show tries to be perfect which even more degrades it’s crediblity and reality aspect. Story progress relies on artificial flawless conflicts and plots which are often trying to be with perfect outcome, but instead the solution is as much stupid as it can be, mainly thanks to Narumi AGAIN! Finale and ""great"" story climax is just as dissapointing. Characters which were worst and in the end did not take any responsibility for their terrible decisions are getting the happiest ending. This is unreasonable icing on the cake which make me sure to hate this show.CHARACTERS: 2/10Except of Haruka there isn’t single main character which I could relate to or even emphatize with. Rest of the main cast must be accountable and intelligent as your average girl walking in Pattaya Street in 2AM. Their decision making corresponds proportionally to their mental development which is stucked since they reached puberty. Main hero Narumi or should I say disgusting SIMP which cannot make rational decision for himself and in consenquence of that hurts everybody around him. His whole character is so stupid, because only thing he does whole show is pitty himself. This pathetic fool doesn’t even know who he loves or not so he decides to date girl which is crazy in love with him only to toy with her feelings and see outcome, because he doesn’t want to hurt anybody despite the fact that this is exactly what he is doing. This is what kind of person he is. Short after when he finally pull his shit together and confess to Haruka it doesn’t even feel real, because it looks like he is doing so because it’s expected of him and not from his own desire, FAKE.When Haruka falls into coma he’s having a hard time, but what about her parents, sister, they having even more hard times yet they aren’t acting like spoiled hurted child. I was heartbroken from love, lost my brother and father all in 2 years time period and seeing him acting like that was so annoying and unrealistic ""thanks"" to my previous painful experiences. All he should do in lot of the situations was communication. Do I think he is the worst character? No, no, no there is even worst piece of crap and not one.Let’s talk about Mitsuki and Shinji. Mitsuki should be rated between top 20 worst female charaters in romance anime. Let me tell you why... She slept with her best friend boyfriend even if it was on purpose to ""save him"" while her best friend is in coma. Sleeping with someone is not only way to help hurted person. Do you see where am I going? She made it completely from her own selfish desires.She basically seduced him in his weakest state, although she could help him as friend. Authors probably thinking that only thing your friend of opposite sex can do to help you is sleep with you. Later after Haruka’s waking from coma she becomes jealous and lonely so first thing she does is going after first man she encounters to sleep with him while being in relationship. This part is actually similar to situations which happens in real life, because hoes often apologize they’re cheating with loneliness. Then she has that audacity to tell the MC not to blame her or Shinji? STFU it’s mostly your decision and your fault. Ofcourse there are always two sides of coin and Narumi bears part of the blame, but that doesn’t apologize your cheating! Mitsuki is manipulativ, self centered, selfish, evil character which is one of the main drawbacks of this show.Now worst character of all is MCs ""best"" ""friend"" Shinji. When Mitsuki doesn’t get the opportunity to throw herself on random guy she jumps on her boyfriend best friend and HE doesn’t stops her. Shinji short after encounters Narumi and has the audacity to speak some moral shit on him and even punch him? Bro you are the biggest crap yet you think you did some kind of weird favor, becausehis girl didn’t slept with random guy but you? It’s even worse because he wasn’t betrayed by one, but two persons close to him.Again all you could do is to talk things through with her and be emotional support to Mitsuki as her friend instead of sleeping withyour best friend girl. God, I was so mad at this point that I was thinking about quiting with this crap.There are some positive characters which I like mainly Haruka and her family which were most credible for me and easy to understand. Especially her sister which has every right to be angry on that blue haired traitor chick. I loved how devoted and supportive she was to her older sister and I found her character development also most interesting after that 3 years time skip. Side characters are allright but nothing to be praised for. Unfortunatelly main characters destroyed whole piece so much for me, that this is only small plus in compare to that cons.ART: 5/10Meh, it looks okay I guess considering it’s older anime, but I could name a lot of even older anime which looks much better. Thing which I didn’t like was motion of the characters it looked weird and funny. On the other hand I liked how creators worked with shadowing and colors of the sceneries.SOUND: 3/10Not my cup of tea and mostly generic romcom type of stuff.Enjoyment: 2/10To be fair I enjoyed first 3-4 episodes where main plot was starting to build and I didn’t know what type of crap is about to come. When characters started to act brainless and plot basically stop making any sense at all, I also started to have serious issue to finish it.Overall: 2/10If you are lover of generic drama shows which are downright dramatic without being credible go for it. In fact I cannot understand how anyone can say it relates to the real world, because you must be living in some fucked up reality man. Everything what is happening in this show is exaggerated and pointless with even more stupid outcome, while at the same time having much easier solution. CHEAP DRAMA!!!There are plenty of much better anime in it’s own genre, so my suggestion is don’t do this to yourself and look for something which won’t lower your IQ. was promising and at first I was really curious about the story, unfortunately execution was so poor mainly in second half, that I even regreted to waste my time on this.STORY: 2/10Pacing of the story is standing on cheap dramatic interactions. No doubt it tries to be unique and aim to more matured audience in terms of not being childish, always happy, not having pitiful problems or being shallow yet, I just didn’t believe almost any of it’s situations because it was overplayed just to make it more dramatic. More so stupidity in which story progresses thanks to it’s even more idiotic characters overshadows all these efforts. Setting of the show tries to be perfect which even more degrades it’s crediblity and reality aspect. Story progress relies on artificial flawless conflicts and plots which are often trying to be with perfect outcome, but instead the solution is as much stupid as it can be, mainly thanks to Narumi AGAIN! Finale and ""great"" story climax is just as dissapointing. Characters which were worst and in the end did not take any responsibility for their terrible decisions are getting the happiest ending. This is unreasonable icing on the cake which make me sure to hate this show.CHARACTERS: 2/10Except of Haruka there isn’t single main character which I could relate to or even emphatize with. Rest of the main cast must be accountable and intelligent as your average girl walking in Pattaya Street in 2AM. Their decision making corresponds proportionally to their mental development which is stucked since they reached puberty. Main hero Narumi or should I say disgusting SIMP which cannot make rational decision for himself and in consenquence of that hurts everybody around him. His whole character is so stupid, because only thing he does whole show is pitty himself. This pathetic fool doesn’t even know who he loves or not so he decides to date girl which is crazy in love with him only to toy with her feelings and see outcome, because he doesn’t want to hurt anybody despite the fact that this is exactly what he is doing. This is what kind of person he is.

Its a more adult oriented show and I of course loved the nudity. It wasn\'t over done to be ecchi but more of a realistic portrayal of intimacy while at the same time giving you that fan art.2We have a lot going for this show. If you watched Golden Time, its along the same lines. Girl falls for guy, girl gets in an accident, gets amnesia and doesn\'t remember anything. We then see our...main male protagonist torn between the girl he use to love and the girl he now loves. We had some heart breaking moments where we see our MC become a pathetic loser. His now ""girlfriend"" pretty much takes care of him because shes loved him all along. This is where I have my biggest issue.First a side issue. I hate girls who have a timid high pitched squelchy sound. They become too kind that its so fake its annoying. All the other characters had decent voices in the English dub.I don\'t know what Takayuki actually saw in Haruka. There was no reason for him to fall in love with her other than her being persistent and a little puppy for him to cuddle up to. She has no actual characteristics that make me want to see how they would grow. This further compounds to the problem when she gets taken out for a few episodes. We have a weak character who offers nothing, wining against a girl who has plenty of interesting things to explore and can also take care of you. To all the people who prefer Haruka.. I\'m sorry, but you have bad taste. It is perfectly reasonable to want a kind sweet cute girl/woman but she has to provide you with something. That something can come in emotional support or through keeping you interested in each others interests, hobbies and personalities.Haruka talks about what she wants to do, but we don\'t really see her struggle to do it. For example. We could see Haruka continuously fail at her dreams while still keeping a positive face. This gives us the viewer a tangible instance of why our Takayuki would be so interested in her. Meanwhile Mitsuki is the athlete who can cook, physically take care of Takayuki and herself and can get a decent paying job to get her own place.You can have a strong character who is generally mild mannered, but we need a reason to care about this mild manner to give us a reason to believe our MC actually would want to be with this person. This actually becomes Haruka\'s arc in the last episode as we see her start to become a strong woman who can choose things on her path, all while being the same individual. Unfortunately it is too late as it is in the last episode.We have one character who is strong willed, outspoken, athletic, pretty, supportive, kind....And we have another character who is pretty, kind and......................That should be about a 5 second pause to let you think about what the problem is here. Why should I care about Haruka. Other than I don\'t really want people to die, why else do I want her to comeback or is that all? It doesn\'t really make for compelling story telling when one of your main characters is simply a pretty face. I\'ve known many pretty faces who turned out to both be some of the most beautiful or most ugly people I\'ve met.This actually manifests itself into a much larger issue. Our MC cant decide who he wants to actually be with. He says one thing while doing another. He becomes passive and lets other characters drag him along. Hes not doing things because he wants to but because others want him to. Even in the ending episodes he never really makes a decision. Haruka who is becoming a strong character, after the Author threw in a mulligan, pretty much makes up her mind about what will happen with their relationship.Everyone but our MC ended up living with the consequences, hes just the stick floating down the river which makes for very boring storytelling. Every character in this show had a small story. We saw a change in some people. The restaurant manager, Haruka\'s boss, the 2 waitresses who suck at their job, our 2 female leads. Even the best male friend had a better arc as we saw him try to get with a girl, fail, succeed and see their relationship turn into a supporting one. Everyone moved except our MC.Animation was decent. Its a show from 2003 and it feels like it but it is certainly a product of its time. Not bad but needed a stronger 2nd woman.  And hey, If you don\'t like this ending there are several side stories you can go watch to alter your experience.

[As Orginally posted on animeNfo][Revised - No spoilers]Lady’s and Gentleman it is definitely worth your time, you are bound to empathize with at least one of the characters, love most and hate others – yes I consider this a master piece a great proportions. To encompass such a story that contains growth and depth within...each and every character is astounding – all within fourteen episodes – brilliant! Every character has holds there own unique personality and is far from mediocre or one of those bands of chicks that are utterly pointless.The story is realistic, but up to a point. The three year coma is highly unrealistic, but the fight for attention, the jealousy, hate, love and passion are all emotions that everyone can associate with. The widespread betrayal is realistic in a sense, that it is somehow inevitable. Unlike children like anime, KGNE does include some mature scenes, but that only adds to the depth of the story and does not in any way come close to hentai, though I still recommend that the audience be of mature age.The graphics are over all good, nothing great nothing horrible, the buildings and foreground are the highpoints, while some of the architecture within the rooms are a bit unrealistic and contains a bit to much CGI and not enough hand drawn qualities.The music is absolutely amazing, without words there are many scenes where the music perfectly conveys the emotion. There is a perfect balance between the music and dialogue. Overall the music greatly compliments KGNE.My overall rating is 9.5/10. The anime has a strong story and character along with good animation and complimented by great music. I highly enjoyed this masterpiece and recommend this anime to all (mature). It is ranked #3 for a reason. And if you don’t believe, then just give it a shot! each and every character is astounding – all within fourteen episodes – brilliant!

What really brings this anime alive is the characters. Though the characters are not exactly ""original"" per se, the way they interact in the world is certainly enough to have me on the edge of my seat the entire series. At risk spoillingl, but he finale is truly struck a cord in me for a romance. It really shows all the characters emotions coming to a head and it is incredibly dramatic. The choice the protagonist makes at the edge also caught me off guard. Not the typical romance and certainly...worth the watch worth the watch', 'This was a really, really good dramatic series.  I found myself riveted to the story line and wondering what was going to happen next.What is so great about this story is that all the characters are ""good people"" and no one does anything really selfish that leads to pain and suffering of others.  Yet due to difficult circumstances, the protagonist boy Takayuki must make choices, and those choices come back to haunt him later in the story.  All the characters are well developed, and you can empathize with each one, and understand their perspective and their pain.

While the story taken from the visual novel is only average the characters are exceptionally well developed and feel very real, especially Mitsuki, who is too deeply in love and Takayuki who is too burdened by guilt for one person to realize the pain he's causing to the other. The characters are flawed and realistic and the facial expressions are done quite well. One more gripe i have about this is that Mitsuki and Takayuki are never shown to be truly happy...even after they reunite. Do not watch this anime for entertainment.

Last time I wrote a review for this show it got removed I guess because my language was too foul or the fact that it really was\'nt a review. I think it was because I called the show a mental  vasectomy. It was though. If yo masculinity aint take a hit after watchin this show then nigga you was suspect to start with. Now listen, ahh this show\'s story was flat out disturbin at times. It included one character that did not know how to set up the sex game, (all she did was take...off her clothes, throw herself at her partner and start cryin, unfortunately it worked cuz she a slut like that).I spend more time in anticipation of beatin my meat then she did givin niggas signs and foreplay. She does however redeem herself by a highly touted slut move of goin on a date with two men at once and gettin hammered Elimidate style.(Hammered means she got drunk not what you were thinkin)  But I digress, this isnt what it was all about. The show chronicles the trials and tribulations of interpersonal relationships of all kinds, which is vastly overlooked. When people  talk about this show they talk about it from a dating sim\'s perspective , which it was, but the show addresses things like juggling work and Kinship with bosses and  just general stuff. Jus to let yall know I added actual review criteria to this rant in hopes that they won\'t delete this shit again, not because I wanted to. Rumbling Hearts should be specifically noted for its handling of a drama with a motif of complexed relationship dynamics, combined with the feelings of the central characters and emotional abandonment across the board. This is what separates this show from contemporaries of this genre. I know plenty whores and what bothered me is the whores I know do they thing and walk the streets like no one\'s the wiser. The whorin (I invented that adjective and it its copyrighted) that goes on in this show is laser guided. Meaning they do it to set in motion a domino effect. AHHHHHHHH the soundtrack is alright. The art is pretty tight considering there are no action scenes outside when they bang each other; oh yea another thing about that, why a nigga can\'t watch them get it on? I mean I\'m not watchin the show specifically for that, but shit if you gon nudity show it all, DAMN. They show them butt neckit gettin in the bed but then decide to be ""tasteful"" and cut scenes?Don\'t draw the umbrella if it aint gon rain!!!

FIN tramp', ""*SPOILERS INCOMING*More like Rumbling Farts, am I right? Comedy genius, I know. But in all seriousness, this is a great romance anime. Just the first two episodes alone were absolutely fantastic. Main character, Narumi Takayuki is confessed to a girl by the name of H̶a̶r̶u̶h̶i̶ Haruka Suzumiya. Haruka was introduced to Narumi by her best friend, Mitsuki Hayase, and when Haruka confesses her love for Narumi, they immediately hit it off. I’m truly shocked at how quickly the romance in this anime progresses. This anime accomplishes more in just two episodes than what most romance shows can do in twelve episodes, twenty-four, hell even forty-eight...episodes.  Which is another perfect example of why Kimagure Orange Road is a god-awful romance anime! Man, oh man, I always find some way to punch that anime in the gut.Don’t you just love watching an anime where it takes an entire season for the characters to actually hook up, acknowledging the fact that they’re in a relationship and hold hands for the first time? Maybe even kiss for the first time? It’s so fulfilling to watch, sure, but Haruka and Narumi’s relationship blossoms so quickly that they’re French kissing in episode one, and by episode two they’re fucking! Unprotected sex, as well. Don't we all like it raw? However, while waiting for Narumi to show up for their date, one day, Haruka is tragically hit by car, and the aftermath is gruesome. Once it’s revealed that Haruka was the victim, the music cuts in with impeccable timing and my jaw dropped when this scene happened. It reminded me of the scene from Hunter x Hunter when Killua threatened to kill Sadaso and Hunting For Your Dream by Galneryus came on at the perfect moment. For Rumbling Hearts, it was just so… unexpected. It was “almost” an entirely wholesome love story. And there was no OP or ED for the first and beginning of the second episode, by the way. What an amazing but also upsetting way to end an episode like that. An extremely bold decision. And I respect that.Haruka survives the accident, but she ends up in a coma as a result. The show does a three-year time skip where Narumi and Mitsuki start a relationship and Haruka is pretty much forgotten with time. That is, until she wakes up. Things get very complicated after this point, and it would be difficult to explain what happens. In my opinion, the rest of the show is not as strong as the first two episodes and slowly teeters out after a while. However, the whole thing is rather impressive for a romance anime and the ending is heart-warming.My thoughts on Narumi as a character are mostly positive. Despite being only fifty minutes of content, I loved seeing his relationship with Haruka develop at the beginning of the show. After the accident with Haruka, Narumi became a nervous wreck, until he starts a relationship with Mitsuki. He gets a job working at a family restaurant and everything is normal. Mitsuki is also a bit of a nervous wreck, as well. Pre-time skip she was the big swimming star of her school, but eventually quit and got an office job. When she isn’t at school, she’s with Narumi and they also make a good couple. Haruka, the girl I prefer more than Mitsuki, is a sweetheart. Sorry for not being an unbiased party, dawg. Haruka is in the hospital for the vast majority of the series and is the quintessential reason for the conflict and drama between the characters. When she awakens, she handles the situation quite well for someone who got caught up in a traumatic accident and lost three years of her life. There are other characters like Akane, Haruka’s little sister. Pre-time skip Akane is pretty enjoyable and fun to watch, but post-time skip Akane is a lot more bitter and stoic after her sister’s accident. Completely understandable. One last character I’ll briefly mention is Daikuuji. She’s… peculiar. She has the tendency of having these crazy, unhinged outbursts and telling people to step in cat shit. That insult is oddly specific and also questionable. She is hot, though. Blondé hair with nice tits. I just love the entire concept of this anime and the character dynamics. It’s all so good.The visuals themselves are not the show’s strong suit. Early 2000’s anime have the habit of being a tad ugly. Not all, but many. For a story like this, the visual department and animation is not completely important. This was very refreshing to watch, and I know I’ve been saying that the past few times, but it really was. I’ve not mentioned the music because it’s one of the weaker aspects of this anime. It’s not bad in any way, just nothing substantial and worth mentioning. My scores:Story: 8/10Art: 6/10Sound: 5/10Character: 8/10Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10 episodes.  Which is another perfect example of why Kimagure Orange Road is a god-awful romance anime! Man, oh man, I always find some way to punch that anime in the gut.Don’t you just love watching an anime where it takes an entire season for the characters to actually hook up, acknowledging the fact that they’re in a relationship and hold hands for the first time? Maybe even kiss for the first time? It’s so fulfilling to watch, sure, but Haruka and Narumi’s relationship blossoms so quickly that they’re French kissing in episode one, and by episode two they’re fucking! Unprotected sex, as well. Don't we all like it raw? However, while waiting for Narumi to show up for their date, one day, Haruka is tragically hit by car, and the aftermath is gruesome. Once it’s revealed that Haruka was the victim, the music cuts in with impeccable timing and my jaw dropped when this scene happened. It reminded me of the scene from Hunter x Hunter when Killua threatened to kill Sadaso and Hunting For Your Dream by Galneryus came on at the perfect moment. For Rumbling Hearts, it was just so… unexpected. It was “almost” an entirely wholesome love story. And there was no OP or ED for the first and beginning of the second episode, by the way. What an amazing but also upsetting way to end an episode like that. An extremely bold decision. And I respect that.Haruka survives the accident, but she ends up in a coma as a result. The show does a three-year time skip where Narumi and Mitsuki start a relationship and Haruka is pretty much forgotten with time. That is, until she wakes up. Things get very complicated after this point, and it would be difficult to explain what happens. In my opinion, the rest of the show is not as strong as the first two episodes and slowly teeters out after a while. However, the whole thing is rather impressive for a romance anime and the ending is heart-warming.My thoughts on Narumi as a character are mostly positive. Despite being only fifty minutes of content, I loved seeing his relationship with Haruka develop at the beginning of the show. After the accident with Haruka, Narumi became a nervous wreck, until he starts a relationship with Mitsuki. He gets a job working at a family restaurant and everything is normal. Mitsuki is also a bit of a nervous wreck, as well. Pre-time skip she was the big swimming star of her school, but eventually quit and got an office job. When she isn’t at school, she’s with Narumi and they also make a good couple. Haruka, the girl I prefer more than Mitsuki, is a sweetheart. Sorry for not being an unbiased party, dawg. Haruka is in the hospital for the vast majority of the series and is the quintessential reason for the conflict and drama between the characters. When she awakens, she handles the situation quite well for someone who got caught up in a traumatic accident and lost three years of her life. There are other characters like Akane, Haruka’s little sister. Pre-time skip Akane is pretty enjoyable and fun to watch, but post-time skip Akane is a lot more bitter and stoic after her sister’s accident. Completely understandable. One last character I’ll briefly mention is Daikuuji. She’s… peculiar. She has the tendency of having these crazy, unhinged outbursts and telling people to step in cat shit. That insult is oddly specific and also questionable. She is hot, though. Blondé hair with nice tits. I just love the entire concept of this anime and the character dynamics. It’s all so good.The visuals themselves are not the show’s strong suit. Early 2000’s anime have the habit of being a tad ugly. Not all, but many.

A lot of the conflicts could be resolved if a character just managed to speak one proper sentence to explain themselves – the industry standard. As a character, Takayuki is about as interesting as the color grey – rest of the cast I thought was good. There are some leaps of logic that could have used further explanation. Also, this...story really didn't have to be an anime, I feel. The Visual Novel format probably served this tale a lot better than an anime ever could. Hell, almost any other form of presentation could have worked better for this subject matter. In this story, the scenes are often defined by their lack of motion instead of their motion, so going through the trouble of animating all of it feels almost pointless. The animation itself is a little inconsistent, but there's not much of a visual spectacle here anyways, so I suppose it's adequate.The story is a good old love triangle, with a very cool twist. The real personal tragedy that is mixed into it, gripped me harder than what I was prepared for. The idea is maybe stretched a little thin, but I have no major complaints with the flow of the story. It's good.It's been a while since I watched anything as grounded as this. Or even a show that took itself so seriously for that matter.

This is a fifth dimension, as vast as space and timeless as infinity; the middle ground between subjectivity and neutrality, opinion and fact. It lies between yourself and the vast majority of the outside world, a bizarro reality in which you cannot see where other people are coming from. Look, there're always going to be varying takes on a project, popular or indie, but even in...areas of disagreement you're usually able to glean the origin of someone’s views, and though you may not share said view, it's at least a perspective you can understand.Then comes that one work wrapped in the twilight zone, its fog tossing aside all acuity and leaving you wondering what in the world other people experienced. Such is the case for me with Rumbling Hearts, an anime adaptation of a VN that tries to be a serious romantic tale, only to stumble in every major department. And yet, taking a gander at the blurbs on this site would lead you to believe otherwise: “This is quite possibly the best anime drama I have ever seen,” “this is a great anime... and believe me, I'm not a big fan of romantic anime,” “Touching. Moving. Emotional. Saddening,” “If you're looking for a tear-jerking, moving, romantic, realistic, dramatic type of anime, here it is,” etc…etc…Now you may be thinking, well Red, most dedicated pages are innately going to be skewed in favor of their respective product. Fair enough, but it’s not just MAL. From Anime News Network (“Powerfully affecting romance that is this year's romantic drama to beat”) to THEM Anime (“Rumbling Hearts is a solid drama/romance title with a moving emotional storyline”), everywhere you go you’ll see highly positive ratings, and it’s figuratively making my mind melt. I have no problem with people liking something I don’t enjoy- heck, I frequently chastise such snobbery given that I’ve found myself on the other side of the spectrum plenty of times. But why the heavy positiveness? The standards for anime productions, including romantic ones, have long been established- is sentimentality really that big a selling point?Perhaps it was back in the mid-2000s when Rumbling Hearts came out. I’m not an anime historian by any stretch of the term, but even I was familiar with the number of VN adaptations being produced at the time: Clannad, Kanon, Air, etc….and the thing all these properties had in common was their indulgence in the paramour genre. And yes, as you may guess, Rumbling Hearts was developed right there alongside them.Well, as happy as I am for the success of everyone involved, let this be a sign that following trends doesn’t equate to quality as Rumbling Hearts is garbage. After taking a years-long hiatus from anime, it wasn’t worth the wait in any way, shape, or form- I deeply regret wasting my time with it and urge any prospective watchers to do the same.The problems begin within the first three episodes, which do a good job establishing our four leads yet falter significantly in fleshing out their dynamics. Takayuki is your charismatic pretty boy held back by an inherent introvertedness; Haruka your shy moe; Mitsuki, Haruka’s tomboy best friend, and Shinji, the static BFF of the group. None of them particularly standout, but one of the few things I appreciated about Rumbling Hearts was how grounded the characters were. Outside of Mitsuki and her Olympian aspirations, no one has any grand plans- it’s purely about graduating high school and moving onto college, taking life one-step-at-a-time like the average joe.Unfortunately, that’s about the only praise I can give the story as everything else crashes and burns. See, Rumbling Hearts’s overarching problem is how it adopts concepts that are actually realistic and wrings them dry for cheap melodrama. Take Takayuki and Haruka’s initial relationship -- the latter has had a long-gestating crush on the former, culminating in Mitsuki infiltrating his inner circle to help set them up. Except why go through such stupid shenanigans when you could’ve just worked with your friend to boost her confidence or played wingman (err wingwoman) during an initial meeting? Anxiety over rejection is something VERY relatable, yet RH treats its resolution like a chess game.When Takayuki and Haruka finally go on their dates, they realize they have nothing in common and consequently lose attraction. Again, a completely natural occurrence in society: sometimes, people just aren’t right for each other and should move on. Only, we’re instead treated to a pathetic tirade from Mitsuki wherein she attempts to guilt trip Takayuki into jumpstarting the relationship because of how long Haruka waited. It’s so dumb, and culminates in this intoxicatingly-cringy scene wherein Takayuki drags Haruka to this hill and proudly claims he likes her. Yeah, if I was a sane person, I would’ve dropped the show then-and-there. But unfortunately, my personal philosophy has been you cannot critique something without seeing it through to the end, and so I treaded onward.A spell must’ve been cast as we’re transported to an alternate plane of existence in which the two lovebirds suddenly have rapport and are on their way towards a deep relationship. I mean, Takayuki acts like a complete pr!ck via considering abandoning her at a festival to spend time with Mitsuki, but we’re meant to forget that in the grand scheme of things. Only, a secondary excursion with Mitsuki unintentionally results in big eyes getting hit by a truck and promptly put into a coma. Given that Haruka was waiting for Takayuki at the place of the collision, the guy ends up wracked with guilt and we’re pushed three years into the future. I’ve never been a fan of time skips, especially in anime, due to them lazily skimping over vital character development, but here the concept wasn’t half-bad due to RH theoretically intermixing flashbacks with contemporary changes as a way of boosting the drama. The problem is, once again, the writers take sympathizable ideas and turn them into cheesefests: ideas gleaned through those aforementioned flashbacks.See, Mitsuki was secretly in love with Takayuki from the get-go, and consequently took care of him whilst he fell into a deep depression, resulting in the two hooking-up in the three-year gap. So much to unpack, so little time. First off, if you felt this way the whole time, why emotionally blackmail Takuyuki into getting back with Haruka when it was blatantly clear they had no chemistry? You would not have been a bad person to let things play out naturally. But no, one of the recurring motifs you’ll find in this series (should you put yourself through such an ordeal) is the writer’s blatant attempts at making Mitsuki unlikable. She chose to continue flirting with her best friend’s boyfriend, and after sh!t hit the fan, went out of her way to seduce him (yeah, reverse the genders and tell me this would be considered non-predatory behavior).And it really is a shame because the plot could’ve been so much deeper. All the pieces were right there to make Mitsuki a tragic character. She gives up her swimming dreams and pursues a career she’s not passionate about - two facets that were presumably tied to her own guilt over Haruka’s accident - yet the show chooses not to focus on that, never provides her a moment to give her side of the story and scream at the world, instead opting to display her continual feelings for Takayuki as they drift apart, and the result not only renders her pathetic, but makes her this thirsty simp. And look, I get what they were going for- they were trying to depict the desperation a partner feels when they realize they’re losing the person they love. However, if you go down this route, you need to ensure that person is a full-fledged human being first, lover second; otherwise you get a trainwreck of an individual of which Mitsuki is Exhibit A. It honestly got cringy seeing her engage in the most frantic antics to win over Takayuki’s heart, and this is coming from someone who grew up with classic hopeless romantics like Johnny Bravo and Jon from Garfield.As for our sapless hunk, he initially starts off well, enduring a severe mental breakdown and giving up his university aspirations out of pure remorse, but quickly devolves into a pr!ck himself the second Haruka wakes up. He repeatedly cheats on Mitsuki (physically and emotionally) with his ex, and while this is originally done under the pretense of facilitating her recovery (more on that later), it becomes clear that he is not solely motivated by altruism. To the writing team’s credit, we never get into a schlocky love triangle due to Mitsuki (rightfully) abstaining from confronting Haruka, but the refusal to give Takayuki any kind of externalized dialogue becomes very frustrating very fast. The show don’t tell approach simply does not work when your cast abstains from acting like regular human beings.Haruka, as stated above, eventually does wake up, albeit with no recollection of the incident (her memory dictating no time to have passed in the three years). The amnesia angle does make sense, but what doesn’t is Haruka being so moronic as to not quickly realize things changed. Her hair has gotten significantly longer, her skin thinner, her sister is grown-up, her friends literally look older….like how do you not put two-and-two together? If the writers had at least throw-in some contrived explanation I’d (mostly) let it go, yet that isn’t the case and we’re expected to believe she’s just that naive.Because of her situation, Haruka does remain the most affable of the original quartet- there’s a genuine innocence to her personality which goads empathy out of you (plus, you know, those wide eyes). It’s unfortunate, then, that it’s never capitalized on for emotional value (save one short scene down the line post-reminiscence wherein she chastises life for doing this to her). She truly isn’t given much dedication for individual growth, no doubt because of the prioritization of Takayuki and Mitsuki, and part of me wonders if the series would’ve been better off axing that whole introduction centered on her and Takayuki’s original paramour. It was poorly-construed, set-up false expectations for Haruka’s presence in the rest of the show, and honestly could’ve been easily replaced with basic flashbacks.Shinji happens to be largely written out of the series after the timeskip, only reappearing in the final act to serve as an ill-conceived one-night stand with Mitsuki (my guy literally stops a drunk Mitsuki from being taken advantage of by a stranger, only to immediately do it himself). It’s evident the writers wanted him to be this “magical asian” who helps fix Takayuki and Mitsuki’s amour in the zero hour, but like many facets of RH, this venture is poorly-executed (and frankly, the scribes would’ve been better off having Mitsuki sleep with a stranger over ruining yet another of their characters).To be fair, Shinji shouldn’t be considered the tetragonist given that his screen time pales in comparison to Haruka’s sister, Akane. Akane is arguably my favorite main character in RH, namely because of how she’s seemingly the only person here who realistically reacts to the situations about her. Initially starting off as a perverted savant, the incident turns her into a serious persona openly hostile towards Takayuki and especially Mitsuki, as she sees their affair as a betrayal of her sibling. Some of the best moments in RH involve her confronting one or the other in a contentious manner, and outside of one that’s ruined by a plot hole, all these rants end-up feeling mostly deserved.+ Unfortunately, she, too, is partially-sabotaged by way of this implied crush she develops on Takayuki that concurrently never goes anywhere and feels forced.A 14-episode serial with five leads had more than enough material to tell its tale, but no, for some reason, the writers felt the need to throw in recurring characters, and all but one of them are annoying to varying levels. The worst of the bunch are Takayuki’s coworkers at this restaurant, two teenage girls (Daikuuji and Mayu) who, if I’m being generous, were maybe intended to be metaphorical shoulder angels for Takayuki yet end-up metamorphosing into screaming banshees in a vain attempt at comic relief. Daikuuji at least gets a decent scene down-the-line wherein she helps Takayuki obtain a book for Haruka, but the series honestly would’ve been better without the two of them.Haruka’s doctor and her nurse compatriots also exist, but they’re honestly so forgettable and so unprofessional that there’s no point in even listing their names. They at least facilitate the plot compared to the duo above, but you can tell the writer’s had bigger Cormac McCarthy-esque ambitions with the small yarns they spin about their personal experiences.Ultimately, the only character I found thoroughly enjoyable was Mitsuki’s boss Ishida. She’s consistent, clear-headed, knowledgeable, and even has her own subplot involving a messy divorce that’s both organically interwoven into the framework of the show AND symbolic for the goings-ons.However, even if you amplified her presence, it would not have outweighed the sheer garbage you gotta put up with. I know the countless apologists out there will claim I’m missing the bigger picture, and to that I just laugh. There are definitely some great ideas and themes here: desperation driving someone to degrade themselves; self-punishment as a means of contrition; feeling entitled to someone else’s reciprocation out of a cost-sunk investment, and so forth. The problem is they’re consistently undermined over fleshed-out. Even the core motif involving the tumultuousness of a relationship borne out of tragic circumstances is a very sound concept and could’ve (partially) made-up for Mitsuki’s behavior had the writers not, you know, finished things with Takayuki realizing his own desire for Mitsuki and ultimately reuniting with her in the finale (bypassing all the horrible stuff he did beforehand….).When it comes to the animation, I generally don’t like to criticize minimalism in anime because I know how overworked and unethical the industry is, and therefore cannot truly understand the motivation behind certain decisions. Rumbling Hearts is certainly on the lower side: multiple scenes feature stationary pictures for metropolitan bustle, background characters rarely move, and you can barely make out joint angles/skin texture. But all cards on the table, this honestly isn’t a cartoon that required extensive motion/detailing, and I’d say no frame is particularly distracting. One of the cool things I actually appreciated about RH was the artists coming up with different outfits for the cast- maybe I’ve been overexposed to shounen, but it was a pleasant surprise given how many franchises bank on 1-2 textiles/per individual at best for the entire run.That said, there were two things I absolutely could not stand about RH’s animation. First is the abundance of “sparkle eye” waverings to indicate strong emotion; it’s stupid, hackneyed, and overused. The second is the lame amount of fan service; nearly every female boasts abnormally long legs and C-cup breasts, the former of which you’re entitled plenty of glances to due to each of them conveniently donning a comically short skirt. And no, it’s never replicated on the other side of the aisle; you rarely see a shirtless man and not a single dude here wears shorts (seriously, does Japan not get hot in this world?). Look, I like sexiness as much as the next chap, but it has to fit the tone, and the truth RH is not a harem nor a romcom; it wants to be this serious tale, yet can’t help falling prey to its adult VN roots.Like most anime, the lower budget didn’t apply to the opening, which brings me to the OST by Ken'ichi Sudō, Yoshiki Minami, and Ado Torai- it is shockingly good. Listening to it separately, I was blown away by the quality of the compositions as they consistently evoke a well-tuned orchestra ripe with strings and percussion. I know VN adaptations usually coast off of a synth-heavy music program, but here it’s clear (or at least sounds like it’s clear) that an actual wind ensemble was available for recording. So why was I surprised? Because the tracks are HORRIBLY integrated in the show. You know all that melodrama I chided earlier? Well, someone on the editing team evidently decided it wasn’t histrionic enough as they have sampled the score’s stronger beats purely for cliche crescendos, and it gets grating very fast.It truly is a dang shame as, on its own merits, this is a great piece of music. I have no problem saying some beats like “Sigh of Night” are on par with the likes of Mass Effect. My sole complaint is that certain melodies do get blatantly rehashed down-the-line as you get to the end of the CD.With regards to the voice acting, I cannot comment on the English performers as I only listened to the sub for a couple of reasons: one, Crunchyroll’s free version didn’t offer the dub, and two, I’ve found school-based anime to normally be better in Japanese. All the seiyū were lifted straight from the VN, and while Akane (Kaori Mizuhashi), Shinji (Makoto Aoki), and Haruka (Minami Kuribayashi) were spot-on from the beginning, Mitsuki (Chiaki Takahashi) and especially Takayuki (Kishō Taniyama) took time to grow on me, though I feel that’s more on the VAs having such flawed scripts to work with, which brings me full circle- don’t watch this show. There’re TONS upon TONS of better quality cartoons out there to waste time on. Rumbling Hearts can’t even provide guilty pleasure delights, wasting decent premises on half-baked schemes you can tell no one put a modicum of thought into (one plot sees Takayuki attempt to get a newer copy of a picture book Haruka desires since his older version would ruin the mirage….except, the publishing date remains the exact same, and he could either way have acted like he found a ruined copy).Yeah, find something else.NOTES+Akane hates Takayuki for refusing to come see her sister in the hospital, only for it to be revealed that her parents personally requested it after an admittedly-emotional scene involving him trying to take Haruka outside. The big question is why did her folks hide this from her? In general, they’re given very little screentime despite their very kid being at the center of this tragedy.-I get that these are high schoolers, but regardless their earlier actions come across as so far-fetched.-The opening has a nice touch in the first few seconds wherein you see both Mitsuki and Haruka’s adult forms morph into their younger ones.-Loved how deep some characters’ eye hues could be: Mitsuki, Ishida, and the Doctor’s stand out. areas of disagreement you're usually able to glean the origin of someone’s views, and though you may not share said view, it's at least a perspective you can understand.Then comes that one work wrapped in the twilight zone, its fog tossing aside all acuity and leaving you wondering what in the world other people experienced.

And look, I get what they were going for- they were trying to depict the desperation a partner feels when they realize they’re losing the person they love. However, if you go down this route, you need to ensure that person is a full-fledged human being first, lover second; otherwise you get a trainwreck of an individual of which Mitsuki is Exhibit A. It honestly got cringy seeing her engage in the most frantic antics to win over Takayuki’s heart, and this is coming from someone who grew up with classic hopeless romantics like Johnny Bravo and Jon from Garfield.As for our sapless hunk, he initially starts off well, enduring a severe mental breakdown and giving up his university aspirations out of pure remorse, but quickly devolves into a pr!ck himself the second Haruka wakes up. He repeatedly cheats on Mitsuki (physically and emotionally) with his ex, and while this is originally done under the pretense of facilitating her recovery (more on that later), it becomes clear that he is not solely motivated by altruism. To the writing team’s credit, we never get into a schlocky love triangle due to Mitsuki (rightfully) abstaining from confronting Haruka, but the refusal to give Takayuki any kind of externalized dialogue becomes very frustrating very fast. The show don’t tell approach simply does not work when your cast abstains from acting like regular human beings.Haruka, as stated above, eventually does wake up, albeit with no recollection of the incident (her memory dictating no time to have passed in the three years). The amnesia angle does make sense, but what doesn’t is Haruka being so moronic as to not quickly realize things changed. Her hair has gotten significantly longer, her skin thinner, her sister is grown-up, her friends literally look older….like how do you not put two-and-two together? If the writers had at least throw-in some contrived explanation I’d (mostly) let it go, yet that isn’t the case and we’re expected to believe she’s just that naive.Because of her situation, Haruka does remain the most affable of the original quartet- there’s a genuine innocence to her personality which goads empathy out of you (plus, you know, those wide eyes). It’s unfortunate, then, that it’s never capitalized on for emotional value (save one short scene down the line post-reminiscence wherein she chastises life for doing this to her). She truly isn’t given much dedication for individual growth, no doubt because of the prioritization of Takayuki and Mitsuki, and part of me wonders if the series would’ve been better off axing that whole introduction centered on her and Takayuki’s original paramour. It was poorly-construed, set-up false expectations for Haruka’s presence in the rest of the show, and honestly could’ve been easily replaced with basic flashbacks.Shinji happens to be largely written out of the series after the timeskip, only reappearing in the final act to serve as an ill-conceived one-night stand with Mitsuki (my guy literally stops a drunk Mitsuki from being taken advantage of by a stranger, only to immediately do it himself). It’s evident the writers wanted him to be this “magical asian” who helps fix Takayuki and Mitsuki’s amour in the zero hour, but like many facets of RH, this venture is poorly-executed (and frankly, the scribes would’ve been better off having Mitsuki sleep with a stranger over ruining yet another of their characters).To be fair, Shinji shouldn’t be considered the tetragonist given that his screen time pales in comparison to Haruka’s sister, Akane. Akane is arguably my favorite main character in RH, namely because of how she’s seemingly the only person here who realistically reacts to the situations about her. Initially starting off as a perverted savant, the incident turns her into a serious persona openly hostile towards Takayuki and especially Mitsuki, as she sees their affair as a betrayal of her sibling. Some of the best moments in RH involve her confronting one or the other in a contentious manner, and outside of one that’s ruined by a plot hole, all these rants end-up feeling mostly deserved.+ Unfortunately, she, too, is partially-sabotaged by way of this implied crush she develops on Takayuki that concurrently never goes anywhere and feels forced.A 14-episode serial with five leads had more than enough material to tell its tale, but no, for some reason, the writers felt the need to throw in recurring characters, and all but one of them are annoying to varying levels. The worst of the bunch are Takayuki’s coworkers at this restaurant, two teenage girls (Daikuuji and Mayu) who, if I’m being generous, were maybe intended to be metaphorical shoulder angels for Takayuki yet end-up metamorphosing into screaming banshees in a vain attempt at comic relief. Daikuuji at least gets a decent scene down-the-line wherein she helps Takayuki obtain a book for Haruka, but the series honestly would’ve been better without the two of them.Haruka’s doctor and her nurse compatriots also exist, but they’re honestly so forgettable and so unprofessional that there’s no point in even listing their names. They at least facilitate the plot compared to the duo above, but you can tell the writer’s had bigger Cormac McCarthy-esque ambitions with the small yarns they spin about their personal experiences.Ultimately, the only character I found thoroughly enjoyable was Mitsuki’s boss Ishida. She’s consistent, clear-headed, knowledgeable, and even has her own subplot involving a messy divorce that’s both organically interwoven into the framework of the show AND symbolic for the goings-ons.However, even if you amplified her presence, it would not have outweighed the sheer garbage you gotta put up with. I know the countless apologists out there will claim I’m missing the bigger picture, and to that I just laugh. There are definitely some great ideas and themes here: desperation driving someone to degrade themselves; self-punishment as a means of contrition; feeling entitled to someone else’s reciprocation out of a cost-sunk investment, and so forth. The problem is they’re consistently undermined over fleshed-out. Even the core motif involving the tumultuousness of a relationship borne out of tragic circumstances is a very sound concept and could’ve (partially) made-up for Mitsuki’s behavior had the writers not, you know, finished things with Takayuki realizing his own desire for Mitsuki and ultimately reuniting with her in the finale (bypassing all the horrible stuff he did beforehand….).When it comes to the animation, I generally don’t like to criticize minimalism in anime because I know how overworked and unethical the industry is, and therefore cannot truly understand the motivation behind certain decisions. Rumbling Hearts is certainly on the lower side: multiple scenes feature stationary pictures for metropolitan bustle, background characters rarely move, and you can barely make out joint angles/skin texture. But all cards on the table, this honestly isn’t a cartoon that required extensive motion/detailing, and I’d say no frame is particularly distracting. One of the cool things I actually appreciated about RH was the artists coming up with different outfits for the cast- maybe I’ve been overexposed to shounen, but it was a pleasant surprise given how many franchises bank on 1-2 textiles/per individual at best for the entire run.That said, there were two things I absolutely could not stand about RH’s animation. First is the abundance of “sparkle eye” waverings to indicate strong emotion; it’s stupid, hackneyed, and overused. The second is the lame amount of fan service; nearly every female boasts abnormally long legs and C-cup breasts, the former of which you’re entitled plenty of glances to due to each of them conveniently donning a comically short skirt. And no, it’s never replicated on the other side of the aisle; you rarely see a shirtless man and not a single dude here wears shorts (seriously, does Japan not get hot in this world?). Look, I like sexiness as much as the next chap, but it has to fit the tone, and the truth RH is not a harem nor a romcom; it wants to be this serious tale, yet can’t help falling prey to its adult VN roots.Like most anime, the lower budget didn’t apply to the opening, which brings me to the OST by Ken'ichi Sudō, Yoshiki Minami, and Ado Torai- it is shockingly good. Listening to it separately, I was blown away by the quality of the compositions as they consistently evoke a well-tuned orchestra ripe with strings and percussion. I know VN adaptations usually coast off of a synth-heavy music program, but here it’s clear (or at least sounds like it’s clear) that an actual wind ensemble was available for recording. So why was I surprised? Because the tracks are HORRIBLY integrated in the show. You know all that melodrama I chided earlier? Well, someone on the editing team evidently decided it wasn’t histrionic enough as they have sampled the score’s stronger beats purely for cliche crescendos, and it gets grating very fast.It truly is a dang shame as, on its own merits, this is a great piece of music. I have no problem saying some beats like “Sigh of Night” are on par with the likes of Mass Effect. My sole complaint is that certain melodies do get blatantly rehashed down-the-line as you get to the end of the CD.With regards to the voice acting, I cannot comment on the English performers as I only listened to the sub for a couple of reasons: one, Crunchyroll’s free version didn’t offer the dub, and two, I’ve found school-based anime to normally be better in Japanese. All the seiyū were lifted straight from the VN, and while Akane (Kaori Mizuhashi), Shinji (Makoto Aoki), and Haruka (Minami Kuribayashi) were spot-on from the beginning, Mitsuki (Chiaki Takahashi) and especially Takayuki (Kishō Taniyama) took time to grow on me, though I feel that’s more on the VAs having such flawed scripts to work with, which brings me full circle- don’t watch this show. There’re TONS upon TONS of better quality cartoons out there to waste time on. Rumbling Hearts can’t even provide guilty pleasure delights, wasting decent premises on half-baked schemes you can tell no one put a modicum of thought into (one plot sees Takayuki attempt to get a newer copy of a picture book Haruka desires since his older version would ruin the mirage….except, the publishing date remains the exact same, and he could either way have acted like he found a ruined copy).Yeah, find something else.NOTES+Akane hates Takayuki for refusing to come see her sister in the hospital, only for it to be revealed that her parents personally requested it after an admittedly-emotional scene involving him trying to take Haruka outside. The big question is why did her folks hide this from her? In general, they’re given very little screentime despite their very kid being at the center of this tragedy.-I get that these are high schoolers, but regardless their earlier actions come across as so far-fetched.-The opening has a nice touch in the first few seconds wherein you see both Mitsuki and Haruka’s adult forms morph into their younger ones.-Loved how deep some characters’ eye hues could be: Mitsuki, Ishida, and the Doctor’s stand out."", '""Rumbling Hearts?

Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34712/Kujira_no_Kora_wa_Sajou_ni_Utau,"[""So far, this is a big disappointment.After having watched two great somewhat similar shows this year, I was looking forward to this one, specially after having seen how the show looks, which I believe is the main reason most people are giving this one a try.Unfortunately, the production is the only good thing about this show, and on some cases even that is a issue, specially on some action scenes, when the character's don't even look like they inhabit the world of the background(or just stand there doing nothing for no reason at all).The main issue I have with this show are the characters. Most...(if not all) of them are very generic tropes with generic designs, some of them do have interesting traits, but they're left pretty undeveloped, and most of those characters exist for pretty much no reason. Seriously, there's an absurd amount of character's being introduced at a nonstop pace, and we don't  know (or remember) most of their names, which makes it even harder for the somewhat interesting characters to have any development, most of those characters will probably be killed at some point (they already started being killed actually), and that's also a problem, since we know nothing about they and have no reason to care about the main characters because of how superficial they are.There are even some small details that apparently are plot holes, since I doubt they'll ever be explained, but I don't want to give spoilers.This show has a lot of obvious issues, and I don't think I can recommend it to anyone, unless you want to look at some gorgeous artwork, but you'll probably end up being betrayed by it.

The people that enjoyed it would say it’s a heartbreaking tragedy filled with death and agony, a show packed with emotion. The people that disliked it would call it a tragedy in a more literal sense, and personally I agree with them. With boring and unexplored characters, predictable and badly paced drama, and a dollop of plot armour to top it all off, Children of the Whales manages to mess up almost every part of what could have made it an interesting watch.Our MC for the show Chakuro...feels like a misplaced side character given a slight power boost. He doesn’t do much but survive the whole ordeal and worry about everything, making him completely irrelevant to the story. Our converted enemy Lykos is only around for plot progression, occasionally rising up to be important and then shrinking back into a somewhat empty cast member. The real MC Ouni is the one that holds the most importance and gets explored more than every other character, but for some reason, the show continues to brush him aside so our two less interesting mascots Chakuro and Lykos can take over.The rest of the cast are only around to create drama, make stupid decisions, and die when needed. I can’t count the amount of faceless blobs of mass that have lost their lives in a desperate attempt to suck out some fragment of despair from its audience. It tries to make us feel attached to people while making no attempt to actually allow us to get to know any of them. There are a few people that the show deems to be of some worth for whatever reason, so it keeps them alive with the wonderful power of plot armour and convenience. Instead of enemies killing them instantly like they do with every other unlucky soul, they take their time to have a little conversation to reveal some plot points, allowing our good guys to make it out alive so they can again be unimportant.Talking about dying, the drama is a collection of the most predictable situations I have ever seen. You can see almost everything coming from a mile away, and when the show does try to surprise you, the horrid pacing stops you from giving a single shit about each lacklustre episode. Add in the already mentioned plot armour and character stupidity and you are left with massacre after massacre that carry no meaning other than to be a cheap emotional scene for us to sigh over. The only parts that carry any impact are centred around Ouni dealing with his history as a mole rat and him trying to protect his friends. However, the pacing and plot armour still brought it down quite significantly. The story could have made a comeback if it had just played its cards right. To make it even worse, the story ends right when everything is building up for a major arc, just to throw the cherry on the mess that was supposed to be a cake.Now the two biggest problems I have with this anime are the plot holes and singing. The show states that the Allied Empire, the antagonists of the show, is a country filled with emotionless citizens for reasons explained in the show. Emotionless characters are a tough thing to write so many opt to go with characters that start off emotionless and slowly learn to have human feelings, with even Children of the Whales trying (and failing) this with Lykos. However, the supposedly blank slates that our good guys fight against sure seem to be pretty human to me. Showing signs of fear, desires, and ambition, it’s really frustrating having the show keep telling you that they are emotionless when they are clearly not.And the bloody singing. Why does the show think it’s alright to break out into songs during the middle of a battlefield? Are they trying to make the show seem more deep and dark with a random sad musical playing over some the serious scenes of the anime? I’m trying to find a reason to like this show but it decides to make up for its terrible drama by distracting us with a little singalong. What the legit fuck? It annoys me so much to see something so out of place in an already bad anime.Children of the Whales is a show that deserves little praise. It is a massive disappoint that it’s only redeeming point is that it looks nice. No one cares about how good a show looks if the story going alongside it is subpar. Avoid this show, move past it and find something that’s actually worth putting your time into, because this show is just a waste of time. feels like a misplaced side character given a slight power boost.

When Kujira no Kora Wa Sujou ni Utau (Children of the Whales) began airing, I had a strange instinct about the show. It felt like an anime that really wanted us to really embrace its ideas but fell short on capitalizing on all of them.Created by Abi Umeda, few people probably heard of the author’s name. Taking a close look at their resume, some of their work consists of horror genre series. Crafting a shoujo fantasy adventure sounded like a challenge. However, I will say this: the author decided...to mold a variety of themes together that felt different from some of the other shoujo fantasy series I’ve seen in the past. To be clear, I think this show is suited for an audience beyond just the female demographic.Are you the target audience? Let’s test that theory. Do you enjoy watching a show with colorful world fiction? How about a show with a large cast of characters? Or conflicts involving a utopia certainly thrown into turmoil? If any of these are on your bucket list, then definitely give it a try. That being said, the main attraction on paper is so far the setting. Mud Whale is really a unique dynamic that will draw attention. In an endless sea of sand of the Sand Era, Mud Whale is a moving vessel composed of an unique civilization. There are the “marked ones” who are individuals with psychokinetic powers but have a short life span. On the other hand, there are the “unmarked ones”, individuals who possesses no powers but have longer life spans. It’s interesting to note that these people live in isolation so they know nothing about the outside world. The plot involves a mysterious girl named Lykos as she changes the lives of everyone on Mud Whale.As a 1-cour adaptation running for 12 episodes, I was a bit worried. Before even watching, I had to be less optimistic because it meant the likely event that the show will omit content and also leave questions for the viewers. Unfortunately, that came to be the case after this series ended. It felt like an advertisement of the manga and wants the audience’s hunger for more. As a manga reader, I am thankful that the anime adapted the story consistently with what the overall tone of the setting. But for the overall story, it really felt lacking. My early impression of the show kept me wanting for more though. The first few episodes established the setting and really gives a feel of a shoujo fantasy adventure. We have the characters living their lives in harmony as part of a utopia. Despite being isolated, they behave like humans and have their own system like the council, battle platoons, and recreational services. That changes after Lykos makes her appearance with Mud Whale while bringing attention from outsiders. It transformed the show from a harmonious story into one with dramatic conflicts. This elevates into bloodshed, pain, and even death.Now as I watched more of this series, I accepted that only the main core characters will get their spotlight. The ones you see on the key visuals includes Chakuro, Lykos, Ouni, Suou, Ginshu, Ryodari, and Sami. Chakuro is the main guy who bears a gentle personality. This is a contrast to characters such as the emotionless Lykos and cold hearted Ouni. While I can’t say Chakuro is an impressive protagonist on paper, he is able to influence others such as Lykos throughout the show. The two forges a unique bond after the two begins to understand each other more. However, the anime doesn’t go too far into developing their relationship nor does it explore them individually as characters. It’s sad to realize this but I think omitting characterization makes the characters harder to accept. For the others, they play a variety of roles such as Suou becoming a leader, Ouni as the rigid combatant, or Ginshu as a guard of Mud Whale. It’s also noticeable that even deceased characters in the series has some influence on the present story. This is especially true when applied to characters like Chakuro as death affects his mentality. Meanwhile, I can’t say the antagonists of the series are appealing. The most noticeable one to point fingers at is Ryodari, the pink haired child soldier. We only see a glimpse of his past but it’s shown that he is clearly unstable and has a thirst to kill for the thrill of it. It lacks any depth in characterization and really doesn’t make him feel believable as a character. Indeed, the characters in the show is a mixed bag. As I watched more and more of this series, it felt like the creator didn’t really put too much thought into making them.On the other hand, the experience I got from watching this anime felt rather memorable at times. The drama brings a reality to death and there’s a sense of tragedy that can send chills down the spine. While character chemistry isn’t always meaningful, it does have a way to express itself and evoke emotions. The vulnerability of the characters is clear and it shouldn’t take long for viewers to discover how death affects them. While it is also a shoujo, don’t expect romance to actually develop though. It serves more as a genre to carry the style of the story. The mystery elements develops more and more as the story progresses but don’t expect answers to everything. It’s explored through some background storytelling but will still leave viewers to their imaginations.Adapted by J.C. Staff, this anime really stood out in the artwork department. A utopia like Mud Whale is depicted as a perfect society and before the events of Lyko’s encounter, it really does look like one. From the simple character outfits to natural spectacles, it’s a sight to feast eyes on. Mud Whale itself is also decorated with colorful features such as the sand particles, atypical structure, and natural aesthetics. The world fiction gives the impression of what a fantasy shoujo should be with the endless sand. It feels like a vast open world video game. Character designs also makes quite an impression as a majority of the cast are children. It gives off a sense of innocence, vulnerability, and youth. There’s also violence so do expect action to pick up once the conflicts really gets going. The amount of blood isn’t presented as shock value but more as a way to illustrate the reality of death. Fan service isn’t explicit but does also exist with bath scenes so be on the lookout for that.Beautiful and harmonious. That’s how I’d describe the theme songs of the show and overall tone of the OST. The technical elements of the soundtrack is outstanding to fit with the genres of this anime. Sound director Jin Aketagawa (known for his work on some other fantasy series) impressed me with the overall direction. The synchronization of the soundtrack with some of the more emotional scenes made them feel impactful. Not to mention, there’s also harmonious singing in the show that really took my attention. Character voice mannerism can be a mixed bag at times. Lykos is too emotionless to be memorable while most of the younger characters all sound the same. Ryodari takes his personality often too far to be declared impressive.Adapting a shoujo fantasy adventure isn’t easy but the final product that came to be felt like it’s missing something. Whether it’s the weak characterization or underdeveloped plot is up for you to decide. It definitely has visual splendor though and sells its setting convincingly to viewers. I just wish they took more time to expand the story and characters to really capitalize on this series as a whole. To me, this is a show that needed more passion to bring audience for appreciation. to mold a variety of themes together that felt different from some of the other shoujo fantasy series I’ve seen in the past.

It lacks any depth in characterization and really doesn’t make him feel believable as a character. Indeed, the characters in the show is a mixed bag. As I watched more and more of this series, it felt like the creator didn’t really put too much thought into making them.On the other hand, the experience I got from watching this anime felt rather memorable at times. The drama brings a reality to death and there’s a sense of tragedy that can send chills down the spine. While character chemistry isn’t always meaningful, it does have a way to express itself and evoke emotions. The vulnerability of the characters is clear and it shouldn’t take long for viewers to discover how death affects them. While it is also a shoujo, don’t expect romance to actually develop though. It serves more as a genre to carry the style of the story. The mystery elements develops more and more as the story progresses but don’t expect answers to everything. It’s explored through some background storytelling but will still leave viewers to their imaginations.Adapted by J.C. Staff, this anime really stood out in the artwork department. A utopia like Mud Whale is depicted as a perfect society and before the events of Lyko’s encounter, it really does look like one. From the simple character outfits to natural spectacles, it’s a sight to feast eyes on. Mud Whale itself is also decorated with colorful features such as the sand particles, atypical structure, and natural aesthetics. The world fiction gives the impression of what a fantasy shoujo should be with the endless sand. It feels like a vast open world video game. Character designs also makes quite an impression as a majority of the cast are children. It gives off a sense of innocence, vulnerability, and youth. There’s also violence so do expect action to pick up once the conflicts really gets going. The amount of blood isn’t presented as shock value but more as a way to illustrate the reality of death. Fan service isn’t explicit but does also exist with bath scenes so be on the lookout for that.Beautiful and harmonious. That’s how I’d describe the theme songs of the show and overall tone of the OST. The technical elements of the soundtrack is outstanding to fit with the genres of this anime. Sound director Jin Aketagawa (known for his work on some other fantasy series) impressed me with the overall direction. The synchronization of the soundtrack with some of the more emotional scenes made them feel impactful. Not to mention, there’s also harmonious singing in the show that really took my attention. Character voice mannerism can be a mixed bag at times. Lykos is too emotionless to be memorable while most of the younger characters all sound the same. Ryodari takes his personality often too far to be declared impressive.Adapting a shoujo fantasy adventure isn’t easy but the final product that came to be felt like it’s missing something. Whether it’s the weak characterization or underdeveloped plot is up for you to decide. It definitely has visual splendor though and sells its setting convincingly to viewers. I just wish they took more time to expand the story and characters to really capitalize on this series as a whole. To me, this is a show that needed more passion to bring audience for appreciation.', ""The best fantastic adventures take you to cool worlds full of cool characters, and, fortunately for everybody involved, Children of the Whales does just that. Anybody who is a fan of mystery, fantasy, psychological themes, and beautiful artwork should most definitely check this show out!Story:A quiet and tranquil ship called the Mud Whale full of short-lived psychokinetics and a handful of boring normies with longer lifespans drifts aimlessly on an endless sea of sand. Barring a few troublemakers the people of the Mud Whale are (mostly) happy in what seems to be a utopian commune of sorts. Unexpected contact with the outside world reveals...that things on the Mud Whale are not as simple and benign as they initially seem, and soon the passengers of the Mud Whale are forced to confront a world that doesn't much resemble the paradise they know. Chakuro (our hero and the archivist of the ship) and his friends must struggle against the pressure of a vast, hostile, and unknown world if they want to continue to live their peaceful lives.Art:It's beautiful, it's perfect, it looks like Linda Evangelista. This show is gorgeous to look at, and a couple seconds should be enough to convince anybody with working eyes of that fact. It has a muted, watercolor look that keeps the atmosphere very tranquil even when some serious shit starts going down. In fact, the mellow art makes the serious shit all the more serious by comparison. The way this show is drawn and animated would reason enough to watch it even if the story was garbage, and as the story is also great you really have no excuse not to.Sound:The only part of the show that isn't amazing. It's good, don't get me wrong, especially the OP. It's just not as perfect as the art and the story. Nothing to sneeze at, but certainly nothing to write home about.Character:Really really good. Chakuro, our main character, is something of a wet blanket at first, but he grows a backbone as the story progresses and he is forced to start standing up for himself and his family. Lykos, a mysterious stranger from abroad, starts off as an emotionally dead husk and fairly quickly becomes a really badass little girl. Kinda like anime Eleven from Stranger Things. Other characters of note include Ouni, the rebellious angsty teenaged shit-stirrer, Sami, the plucky (almost) girlfriend of our protagonist, and Suou, one of the non-psychokenetic individuals on the Mud Whale who is being groomed to become the next chief of the ship. A plethora of side characters, each interesting and dynamic in their own right, help the Mud Whale feel like a lived-in community filled with real people. This, of course, serves to make the fact that they are about to get their shit kicked in all the more tragic.Enjoyment/Overall:This show is great. It is going to be a fun and colorful adventure full of complex characters, tough decisions, and really beautifully animated fights, scenery, and characters. The world is cool, the characters are vibrant, the visual is spectacular, and the episodes have a natural dramatic tension that is very exciting to watch unfold. Fans of other awesome fantasy/mysteries like From the New World (Shinsekai Yori), Dennou Coil, Uta Kata, and Made in Abyss will really get a kick out of this show. If you have no idea what any of that stuff is, watch this show anyway. You'll love it. And then, if you do, watch that other shit too.

I was anxious to be able to watch it and now I feel that all my expectations are being fulfilled very well. And I'm still being surprised.Art (10)The first thing I wanted to mention about it, is the beauty of the drawing and the color palette. The colors are mostly very soft, pastel tones, giving a more innocent and pure connotation for the protagonist characters. The antagonists, in turn, always receive stronger colors - I found this quite interesting....In addition, colors also direct well the emotions that viewers must feel: sad themes lead to environments in navy blue, joyful themes ranges from an orange rose to all the colors of the rainbow. It's just beautiful to watch.The character traits are all super delicate - from the strands of hair to the minutest details of the eyes, the clothes and even the movement of the wind. Even before the series was released, it was this delicacy that made me super excited to be able to follow the anime. I admit: it is my weakness. The way the studio stayed true to Umeda Abi's art style made me very happy too. She is a wonderful mangaka. I really, really loved the art.Sound (10)The second thing I wanted to mention is the wonderful soundtrack. A lot of people don't pay much attention to this kind of detail, but I'm completely in love with the entire OST without even having access to the media yet. It's the kind of OST that I definitely have the interest to get for my collection. And the ending theme! Oh goddess, I love this song. Rionos' voice is simply angelic, this song always gives me goosebumps. The lyrics of the song are very cute and practically whispered, harmonizing a lot with the soft tone that the anime passes, the idea of \u200b\u200bpurity and sadness.Story (9)The story is a bit hazy at first and is being built slowly, like a puzzle. To the present moment, I am giving it a 9 because I still don't know the end of it. I hope it continues to surprise me positively. But it's worth the rate because it's the kind of plot you normally expect from a shounen manga, an adventure full of tragic and even violent twists.Characters (8)The characters follow a similar path of history: they are all poorly developed. The story focuses on Chakuro, the narrator, but it explores a bit of several other characters, so it leaves little room for deeper development. The viewer knows the names of the characters, whether they are ordinary humans or controllers of thymia and in some cases, a bit of the past of one or another. But yet their emotions - or their lack - are so well worked out that it also thrills you. Again, I hope to continue to be positively surprised in this regard.Okay, I may sound a bit partial here because I love their design, but there's no way you can watch this series and not want to hug Chakuro and protect him from all the malice in the world. They are all just adorable.Enjoyment/Overall (9)I'm having loads of fun and getting lots of excitement too. I love these silly and delicate stories involving human feelings, thematizing individual freedom, the value of life and friendship. This story is a root shoujo (which means it couldn't be more original to the genre, I guess)!So, if you like shoujo stories like I do, I'm pretty sure you are going to like this one quite much.

Children of the Whales is a story which could not be for anyone. It appeals and please quite a niche group of people. Nevertheless it did really please me with its unique story and world.§§§§ STORY §§§§So I cant really go deep in the story without spoiling it so I won’t. That would lessen the fun of watching it yourself. Children of the Whales is told form the perspective of Chakuro who occasionally narrates some of his thoughts. It...gives the feeling like you’re being told an tale or good story by the mc himself. For just 12 episodes this anime feels deep and convinces me that there is a lot of lore behind the real storyline. They have funerals, festivals, laws, culture. It all adds up to interesting world building while simultaneously laying the foundation for future events. It really conveys a story rich world and shows that the Whales is more than just a plot device. It is something that lives and breathes. Something where obviously more happened, before we got to see it. I feel it was unjustified to be just 12 episodes and feels like it could have been easily 3 seasons long with the amount of lore unexplored.The characters aren’t abused up to the point they will just be for tear jerkers or comic relief. They have more purpose, like in the real world. It makes each of the characters stand more out, even if they don’t get much screen time.I’ve got to say that the pacing is fast but well justified. It doesn’t go in to deep in the history of the Whales, what was disappointing, but it does create a new story for us to be a part of. Luckily it doesn’t drag out unnecessary parts as it feels like you will always move along the story while watching. The fast pacing does leave some information left desired.§§§§ ART §§§§The background felt like Chinese art style with anime characters popping in. It felt so fresh. The easy-going background gave my eyes plenty of rest while still being appealing. I would say that it is one of the strong points of Children of the Whales. I noticed some CG was used for sand and some other effects, but it was blend in so well that it made the anime better looking, rather than an abomination (like most CG scenes).The character design was simple yet attractive.  It fulfilled the role of “simple looking” on an island without too much tech.The way thymia was handled was very beautiful. A simple depiction of power while still being very appealing. The rules are simple, more thymia means more power. Luckily there is no stupid thing like instant powerup with mad effects. It was simple and appealing.§§§§ CHARACTERS §§§§We see multiple characters developing and adapting to a changing world. Reactions and actions were taking accordingly if you would think about how the characters were before the invasion. Emotion plays a big role, but that doesn’t really seem prominent at first. It gradually evolves and opens up. You might re-watch it for the sake of understanding the first few episodes. Because I didn’t really understand the world and the characters yet, their reactions ticked me off and I was almost ready to drop it. But when I look back, I think it was really well done.Im happy the characters don’t act “out of character”. The characters have their own treads and their own strengths and weakness. We get to see Chakuro evolving from slow mc to better mc. Suoh/Souo changes his thinking and decision making, but still remains kind and gentle. Ouni stays badass.I’m a bit puzzled by Lykos, she wasn’t really easy to read and the story didn’t really support her choices and motivation. I guess she is a nice addon but I feel like she wasn’t really needed. To bad she had to replace a character.Because the story deviates real quick I’m not discussing the characters in detail, as that would spoil most moments. I would say that they won’t be new characters at the end of the season, but you get to see what makes them move and what moved them. On the other hand, if this would be 24 episodes, they could flesh out just a bit more of character.§§§§ MUSIC §§§§The music is beautiful and does a great job at expressing scenes, guiding the pace and supporting the art in general. The ambient tones fluently changes to upbeat battle style with each changing scene. The scene where Neri (purple lil girl) sings and dance was beautiful but very alienated from the story. It felt theatrical and soothing. It did add some element, yet I puzzled what it exactly added.The music felt in a way nostalgic, reminding me of something spacious, worldly, yet very close and cozy. I don’t know if this is personal, but I liked it.§§§§ FINAL THOUGHTS §§§§This anime sails between being good and mediocre. Some moments were bright and other were really frustrating. As mentioned earlier I was ready to drop this anime on episode 3 but something etched me to really finish the story and I’m glad I did. It wouldn’t be an anime for many people but in a way it is really artistic. I had some moments where I could see the skill of the story writer, how things turned out or how things are handled. It didn’t feel like there was plot armor and most things played out very natural. Sacrifices are made and somethings are gained from it. I would ship Chakuro and Sami and I hope they will be happy together.If you would love unique painteresque anime with unique premise and a beautiful evolving story, I would recommend you Children of the Whales! If you like mc who do crazy ass pulls and always push through or clear and predictable story, this isn’t your call.

If you're on the fence on watching, let me personally encourage you.In a weird way it feels like a game of Civilization - little countries with hidden motives and philosophies, some are stronger than others in debatable aspects and dreaming of expanding your knowledge of the world to truly understand you're place in it.That is all. Watch along this series, it's looking like it's already and gonna...get good. get good."", 'Children of the Mud Whale is a beautiful show with an interesting world that is a complete waste of time. Most of us watched it for the pretty background art and fascinating concept, but it fails miserably to deliver on these.Story: 33 is a bit generous and is there solely because of 1) a death early on that caught me by surprise, and 2) the world building. Mud Whale has an interesting world, with whale/ships powered by grotesque monstrosities on a sand ocean. There\'s an evil empire and other kingdoms scattered around, it all seems like it should be really entertaining but it just isn\'t....The direction is awful, it feels like they didn\'t take their episode numbers into account at all. A third party that intends to ally with the Mud Whale shows up at random in one episode and just hangs out with them for the rest of the series, not affecting anything. Information is doled out whenever the show feels like it and characters are introduced and killed off in bulk.Art: 8The art is where this show excels. The background art is beautiful, the world looks interesting and fun. You want to learn more about the unique society on the mud whale, their specific customs that they\'ve developed from their years in isolation, the world they inhabit. Where it fails is the action direction. Emotionless enemy soldiers wait their turn to attack the helpless and allow themselves to be mowed down for no reason. There is a scene where a weakened old man is able to kill two soldiers by stumbling into them off a cliff, after they\'d already cut a gash into his chest. Why they didn\'t get out of the way is behind comprehension. The show doesn\'t look bad necessarily in motion but it\'s nothing impressive. It\'ll get you some nice screenshots though.Sound: 8I\'ve got a terrible memory when it comes to background music and OP/ED themes. There is, however, a memorable scene in one of the episodes where a character sings a song amidst a battle and it\'s genuinely beautiful. It briefly revived my hope in this series before it was beaten back into the sand.Characters: 1The characters are the worst part of this show.Chakuro - the main character who doesn\'t feel like a main character. He\'s described as an archivist but this aspect of his personality is so underdeveloped that I genuinely forgot that that was his job until a character referred to him as ""Archivist of Falaina."" On top of that he\'s a weak, ineffectual crybaby who, unlike better crybabies like Deku from My Hero Academia, never gets better.Lykos - she literally had the emotions sucked out of her prior to the series and it shows. She\'s quiet and mopey, refusing to give potentially crucial information until the end of the series despite having it the entire time.Ouni - The only decent character. I think he even exhibits character development, but my god is he not enough to save this section of the review, let alone the entire show.The main issue is, as I mentioned before, that they introduce characters at random. ""Oh this character\'s going on a potentially dangerous mission? Give him a best friend who wants to come with."" ""Hm... there\'s not enough internal strife, let\'s introduce two new characters who literally explain away their absence with a \'we\'ve stuck to the edges of the Mud Whale til now\' as if that excuses their delayed introduction and have them stir things up"" They\'re reluctant to kill off important characters so they invent new characters whenever they want and throw them in the story, hoping to eke out some emotional payoff.Enjoyment: 2There are just enough pretty moments to edge this series above a 1 for enjoyment. It\'s not fun to watch, it\'s really boring even during the action. The fact that they introduce new characters just to kill them off destroys any tension once you know who\'s going to survive. There are about 2 deaths with any real impact, and even then only the first one is felt by the viewer. The penalty for the magic system that the characters have is short lifespans, which is a totally ineffectual penalty. Sure the older characters are likely to die, chances are it won\'t affect anyone you really care about for another few years, and it\'s difficult to care about these characters anyway because they just don\'t do much.Overall: 3Children of the Mud Whale is a bad show. It\'s a pretty show, but it\'s bad. The art and sound keep it from being a 1 or a 2 but they are not enough to give it an even passable score. This is, after all, an anime, not an art book.

It\'s a pretty show, but it\'s bad. The art and sound keep it from being a 1 or a 2 but they are not enough to give it an even passable score. This is, after all, an anime, not an art book.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Whales are intelligent, majestic creatures. Rulers of the sea by size and by power.In comparison, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau has no size. It has no power.All it really rules over is the bottom of the ocean – right where it belongs.STORYCredit where credit is due: Kujira no Kora (as it will be shortened to from here on out) contains a neat premise what with its expanse of sand, an inexplicable titan, and the cultural norms it creates. It at least has the footing necessary to get the ball rolling (or, in this...case, get the “boat” rowing).But as a narrative, as a story, this whole venture sinks rather than swims.Major issues reveal themselves swiftly and without remorse. For instance, the bad guys have a weird tendency to just not really do anything in situations where they clearly have the upper hand, turning specific events into an excuse to push the plot in a certain direction rather than into intense moments that allow it to develop naturally. Moreover, hardly anything is known about these adversaries since the show will go long stretches without talking about them or at least referring to them, missing out on crucial exploration of their side.The trading of information also encounters trouble. Characters like Lykos will hold onto vital clues for very little reason other than to obstruct the narrative. Then, in complete opposite fashion, someone like Aima will descend in front of Chakuro to give him her umpteenth example of deus ex machina so that the plot at least “makes sense” when going to its next part.Quotes must be used there since Kujira no Kora often treads into nonsensical territory. Random characters, such as the older elders, appear and disappear out of nowhere. Certain interactions, such as Chakuro speaking with one of the Nous directly, involves incredulous logic. Important changes, such as Ouni’s newfound powers, have miniscule impact in the aftermath of their discovery.This systemic plague within the writing festers and oozes its way into the more fundamental aspects of the show. An excessive amount of exposition bogs down the flow, and pacing can get too quick which hinders events. There’s also the intermittent comedic relief. It stilts the tone since people are literally dead or dying and such jokey asides clash hard with the serious morbidity.Even disregarding the comedy, Kujira no Kora breaks apart with its drama and its action, the areas that make up the bulk of its story.On the drama side, it’s tough to care about the loss of life which occurs. It tries to be emotional insofar as those who perish usually represent major figures in the lives of those nearby, but the lacking presence of these people to begin with prevents the drama from landing.On the action side, not enough happens to justify the skirmishes. Those who are Marked have essentially magical powers, but their abilities and their usage rarely (if ever) aim for an interesting angle let alone reach memorable status.Problem after problem hounds this story nearly every step of the way. It’s largely incompetent, and its premise simply cannot carry the glaring mishaps and the ludicrous inadequacies that weigh it down. This vessel doesn’t just sink; it implodes.ART & ANIMATIONWhile the show may not recover from the damage to its narrative, Kujira no Kora at least dazzles with the artistry at its disposal.Chief among its wonders is the color palate. The anime opts for a watery fade to achieve its softer hues, coinciding with the sea motif and forming the watercolor looks for many of its visuals. It also chooses much lighter colors in general: pinks, teals, yellows. They add a vibrant contrast not only to the darker blues and purples but also to the overall darkness of the mood at hand.The rocky outcropping the characters call home also gets attention. Craggy walls and earthen stone encase their lodgings. Rudimentary holes act as rough windows. Quaint amenities line their rooms. Vegetation on other floating islands and the regal cities of the “normal” people have a place, but this monolith of mud and clay captures the rustic intent of the anime.Combining the colors and the setting provides the show with ample opportunities to highlight the beauty of this world. Again, it almost never leaves the static ruins of their roaming giant. Yet, when a sunset casts light on their abode or dancing lights flicker in the nighttime air, it becomes easier to forgive the stale variety and to appreciate these gorgeous segments.While the art and the artistry often impress, the more nuanced, technical side of things isn’t as captivating. Cinematography remains standard for many of its scenes, and the actual animation during bouts or as they go about their daily lives stays relatively straightforward.Kujira no Kora prevails with other details, though. The designs for its characters fit the scope and the lore of their era and their culture as loose clothes, accessories, sandals, and other simplistic garb invoke a native feel to their looks. And above them, a painted, almost canvas-esque sky stays aligned with the painted vibe of the art, granting an awe in all directions.Overall, the anime contains some rather good artistry. One can’t complain too much here.CHARACTERSThe characters within Kujira no Kora, however, cannot evade complaints.Chakuro takes the helm of this “ship” as the lead star and the narrator, speaking of his account aboard their home and his knowledge of the Falaina people (i.e., his people). However, he’s entirely too passive to be considered a worthwhile character within the anime. Not that being passive is inherently a problem; it’s that that’s all he is.He’s a writer at heart, so it’s understandable that he stays on the sidelines during fights (even if he’s apparently a very strong thymia user) since he has little in the way of battle training. But he contributes almost nothing else. He watches events play out, and he cries a lot, yet he just laments the situation and goes along with nearly everything that happens around him.Deaths of dear friends do affect him, so he’s at least attuned with the gravity of their dilemma. That’s not saying a whole lot, however, when he won’t speak up even if he knows the causes behind it. Worse yet, Chakuro will constantly talk about wishing to record the stories of his people for historical purposes episode after episode, but his progress on this front must be minimal because Kujira no Kora rarely showcases him doing as such. I.e., he talks the talk but does not walk the walk.Chakuro is so bland and so useless that it’s a miracle to see him connected to this story whatsoever. Lykos is a walking blob of a character, too. She begins as a blank slate of sorts, harboring almost zero emotion when Chakuro and the others find her. Meaning, the anime primes her for an interesting arc to follow throughout the season.True to its trends, though, Lykos succumbs to the same problems of overt passivity and minute contributions. She receives a tiny bit of backstory near her introduction, and she’s related to the main baddy, but the extent of her presence stops there. She barely says or does anything meaningful despite her growing emotions.Lykos maybe-possibly develops feelings for Chakuro, indicating her recent changes on a psychological level. Sadly, their relationship neither goes anywhere meaningful, has a resolute foundation, nor is challenged to any significant extent. That is to say, just as they are individually depleted as characters, the bond they share turns hallow as well.Besides these two leads, Kujira no Kora includes side characters who likewise fail to meet a proper spot. Shuan, the eyepatch guy, is the outlier amongst everyone insofar as he cares not for anything, including (apparently) his own wife. But he’s almost too much of an outsider, leading his small asides to register as inconsequential moments without much follow-through. Then there’s the purple-hair goofball who gets some pretty vital backstory right before a key scene in his arc. It demonstrates a complete lameness in the character writing, aggravated further by his absurd motivations.Perhaps the only two notable characters in the show are Suou and Ouni.Suou becomes the voice of reason whose nonviolent ideologies struggle against the fear and the hatred which brews in the hearts of his fellow thymia users. He’s the anchor of hope that the rest of the characters look up to, a mature person who himself has a lot left to learn. As a supporting character, he’s at least beneficial to the ensuing plot.Ouni is arguably the most well-written character in Kujira no Kora, but it’s still a weak and precarious backing. The anime sets up him as a conflicted anti-hero who inspires everyone to fight back and who cares deeply for the misfits he has befriended over the years. His never-ending angst and his much-to-be-desired backstory don’t do him any favors, but the personal troubles he endures push him down the right path. A statement that cannot be said for the other two main characters.Unfortunately, Suou and Ouni find themselves drowned out by a mixed bag of other additions to the cast. Sami enlightens the audience to the harshness of their world, Hakuji shows how people can redeem themselves yet, and Masoo reminds everyone of the unfair toll they have burdened. On the opposite side, Oruka is an annoyingly blasé villain in need of depth, and the latecomers from the new country arrive way too late indeed.For these characters, it’s mostly just a wash.MUSIC & SOUNDA cleansing of the audio is also required for Kujira no Kora.At the minimum, its opening track “Sono Saki e” harbors a hefty emotional tone that strikes at the bittersweet layer permeated throughout the anime. The tender female vocals and the light acoustic guitar strings work in unison to meld this mood, relying on the drums and the shakers for a steady rhythm. It’s perhaps slightly repetitive in its structure, but poignant delivery for many of its lyrics supplant this grievance.The tail end of each episode brings the ending track “Hashitairo”, another song aiming for that bittersweet tone. However, it dives into it with more gusto. Female vocals and acoustic guitar strings return alongside piano keys, extra backing vocals, and violins to emphasize the bitter half of the term. Unlike the OP, this ED skirts around repetition, yet the middle section of the track meanders to a questionable degree. Still, the poetic, story-like lyrics introduce a complexity that befits the song’s equally complex emotions.While neither the OP nor the ED stand out as too impressive, they at least do not go down the contemptable route of its semi-insert songs. Over the course of Kujira no Kora, a few musical numbers per se pop up to crescendo as sweeping emotional points in the story. Per usual, though, they fall flat. Sometimes they’re way too out of place, like as the prelude to a battle about to commence. Sometimes they’re too methodical, like as the beginning of the end to the story’s conclusion. Whether melancholic or uplifting in nature, these songs are easily the worst audio decisions in the anime.The majority of the rest of the audio elements simply pass the mark. Heavy cellos and quicker instrumentation coincide with the somber and tenser parts of the anime (respectively), but the collection of tracks it touts leave behind nothing all that memorable. The voice-acting performances similarly lose out on any standout mentions. And the sound-effects, regardless of the thymia possibilities, remain par for the course.In short, the music and the sound fairs slightly better than the other aspects of Kujira no Kora, but it ends up in the red anyway.ENJOYMENTTo say I disliked this anime would be an understatement.The weaknesses throughout the season were already enough to make it a soured and sorrowful experience, but the anime goes that extra step further with some more baffling choices. Key among them involves a certain purple-hair antagonistic who shall go unnamed still for being absolutely insufferable.Jim Carrey as the Grinch put it best: “Loathe entirely” describes this annoying, eye-rolling, grating nuisance of a character (intentional or not). Yet the show steps it up again by making him into a literal personal jester later on, increasing his loathsome behavior to another level after what should have been his leave. He pretty much deserved such a fate for being a psychopathic lunatic, but, having hit maximum on the hated scale beforehand, he breaks it afterwards. He has now become one of my least favorite characters I’ve ever had the displeasure of viewing onscreen, and I pray I never have to see him mentioned anywhere ever again.Furthermore, I couldn’t take the anime very seriously at all. There’s a distinct part in episode five that is one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments I’ve ever seen in a long time, if not ever. The Nous creature gets hit by an arrow, and its reaction is priceless. The scream, the eyes, the camera zooming in and out. It was a trifecta of funny that wasn’t meant to be so but got there anyway.Also why would throwing sand at each other equate to a worthwhile pastime for these stranded people? I get that they must be bored out of their minds out there, but the fact that nobody seems to question such a dangerous activity comes off as irrational.Maybe I’m being nitpicky over such a tiny detail, but it just goes to show how frustrating this whole project ended up being for me. It’s empty. It’s inane to watch. It’s borderline bottom of the barrel.When this one did finally wrap up, it boldly declared that, “The journey will continue.” I can acknowledge its confidence for future success – but that’s as far as I’m willing to extend my olive branch.Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau fails miserably. Like a golden toilet, it shines on the outside thanks to its beautiful art, but, on the inside, it contains excrement in the form of poor narrative writing, odd musical choices, lame characters, and unappealing entertainment. A whale of a time it is not.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a ridiculous enemy, improper plot handling, nonsensical happenings, fundamental problems, and an uninteresting direction sink its maiden voyageArt & Animation: Good, vibrant colors and a painted style give the visuals a gorgeous look even if the more technical traits like cinematography and movement do not impressCharacters: Bad, Chakuro and Lykos are horrible protagonists, Suou and Ouni have a mediocre presence, and the remaining supporting and extra cast members lean towards the weak, negative sideMusic & Sound: Bad, the OP and the ED demonstrate emotion, but the absurd singing moments and the rest of the lackluster audio elements fail to contributeEnjoyment: Terrible, has one of the most annoying characters ever seen, laughable when it doesn’t intend to be, and increasingly frustrating the further along it proceedsFinal Score: 2/10 case, get the “boat” rowing).But as a narrative, as a story, this whole venture sinks rather than swims.Major issues reveal themselves swiftly and without remorse.

Not a single death except for the first one is even remotely sad or emotional. Even when they have a...long death sequence to show how much two characters cared for each other, it just doesn\'t work. If every character was treated like an important character and given time and more than 12 episodes to develop, I might like this considerably more, but they aren\'t so every death is kind of just like ""Ok so he\'s dead now, cool I guess?"" because none of the characters that die are properly given any screen time or relevance or dialogue or backstory or anything at all except for the episode of, or maybe the episode before, their death.All of this eventually grates on you and is EXCRUCIATINGLY boring. The mechanics of the emotion sucking things that power the ships are completely stupid and have very limited explanation as to what exactly their powers are.There is also a song scene later in the show that kind of got on my nerves because the show was acting like this was a massive moment with tons of crazy tension and build up. It was kind of tooting its own horn a little by thinking that this scene was so important and tense that a song sung by some random little girl dancing in the sand ocean would be necessary and feel heavy and important.

It probably would have been more essential where exploiting a desirous on began challenging the unbearable of living and anticipating the less aesthetic human nature."", 'One must truly understand, to a profound degree, the duality of the nature of life to fully appreciate this anime and all it has to offer this world. If this is you, as it is me, then this will likely become your favorite anime. I sincerely hope it comes back for a second season, though certainly not at the expense of the delivery of its message. Truly a masterpiece, as it stands.There is nothing more that needs to be said.Though when I hit submit it says; ""Please enter a longer review""So I\'ll repeat; There is nothing more that needs to be said. ', 'Kujira No Kora is beautiful anime in all senses! I realize not everyone will like, because it’s quite a sensitive story; it’s that kind of story which leaves you, at the end, with lots of tears. The story is quite interesting too – it’s filled with a magical world and mysteries; so, I’m sure if you start watching it, you’ll end up watching all episodes in a row, considering how much addictive the show is. I need to be sincere with you guys: the show is really interesting, but the story has some inconsistencies; it’s a shoujo show, but, as far as I’m concerned it...ends up being too shoujo – to the point where the story becomes unrealistic, at times, because the show follows rigorously the “shoujo criteria”. Everything said, you’ll love the show, so don’t hold back and just watch it right away! It’s on Netflix, after all, come on, guys![Story: 7/10][SPOILERS ALERT] There are minor spoilers ahead, otherwise it’s really hard to write this review: but don’t worry, they’re not anything which will make a difference when you’ll watch the anime. Also, review big AF ahead.Kujira No Kora has a marvelous universe construction, you’ll be dumbfounded by how well constructed it was. The story is based in a utopic island which moves around a sea of sand – and, yes, in the story the sea is made of sand: it’s not a figure of language. The island has a small community living within it; to them, that’s their entire world, for they have no idea of the world which exists out there. It seems that utopic island Thomas More wrote about: everything is beautiful, everyone is an equal (well, almost everyone) and all of the people live their lives with no worries and no violence (it’s almost as if they don’t know what violence is).That said, there’s something which divides people in two groups: the ability to use a power called “thymia”. Ninety percent of the people can use it – being known, then, as the Marked; the other ten percent can’t use it – being known then as the Unmarked. A board of Unmarked elders hold the political reins of the island; however, the work is divided equally among everyone – even among the Unmarked. So, in this sense, is almost as if that island represented a communist system (if not for the difference in political power among the Marked and Unmarked, but the Marked have super powers; so, I guess that makes them equal lol).The people who live in the island are different from the people from their ex-homeland: while they can feel such stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking feELiNgS, the people from the outside world don’t have feELiNgS. Now, I can begin to show how incredibly intelligent the show is: I see as a portrayal of our world if it were to become a dystopia (in a way it already is if we stop to think about it). And it’s really interesting how you start the show thinking it’s a utopia but, in the end, you realize it’s a dystopia. In this universe, it came a time in human history when humans deemed emotions could only get in the way, so it’d be better to live without them; therefore, they became heartless soldiers. The people in the island can only live this perfect, utopic life in the island, because they ignore the outside world. And it’s really interesting to see, as the show progresses, that some people in the island, who have emotions, can be really cruel at times – so, they are just hypocrites pointing their fingers to the outsiders, who don’t have emotions, and calling them “monsters”. Regarding the outsiders, it’s exposed how far it came the human stupidity to think it’d be better to live in a world without emotions.So, the brilliance of the show lies this portrayal of us, of how far the human stupidity can go and of how deluded we can become, unable to see our own hypocrisy. Also, the brilliance lies in the way the show can demonstrate emotions in such a stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking way. It just kills me how I ended the show soaking wet with my tears. I’d give a 10 for the story, if not for the inconsistencies; nonetheless, it’s an amazing show.[Art: 10]The direction of art is splendid! The island is so beautifully constructed visually that it only can aid the understanding that is a little perfect world! The art is so well done that it really makes you think that island is a utopia. The art is so good that I’d watch the show just for the art. That’s how good it is.[Sound: 10]It’s rare to watch an anime with an orchestrated soundtrack; just that considered makes the sound of the anime incredible. But besides being orchestrated, the melodies are heavenly, really, they’re heavenly! When you hear that beautiful music, you’ll believe that island is not only a utopia, but it’s heaven. Not to mention the few songs in the show, sung by the own characters, have such a good lyric and carry such a huge emotion that when you start listening, you’ll cry immediately.[Character: 7)As I’ve said above, the show can be really, really shoujo – which, on one side, make it amazing to watch all of those guys with emotions blurting out of their skin acting so passionately around other guys (and girls); but, on the other side, it makes the show unrealistic: Suou and Chakuro, for example, are so kind and passionate that their behavior, at times, is just ridiculous (though, most of the time is just tear dropping). Many characters lack depth while some are really deep and well-constructed; so, if you forgive that and the inconsistencies, I can grant you’ll have a great time filled with tears watching the anime.As I’ve said above, this kind of show is not for everyone, but, in my opinion, the best shows are the ones filled with passion, I’m sorry not sorry.[Enjoyment: 10] and [Overall: 8.8]I’ve spoken so much about the show in this review that I guess it’s enough (and obvious) to say, with all of its faults, you’ll love the show.

For the first time in a long time I am actually sad that an anime has gone this poorly. I had hopes that Children of Whales (KujiKora for short) could be a little gem of an anime. JC Staff are an animation studio that have probably been the most consistent studio in all of Japan and have given us some incredible classics like Nodame and Hachimitsu as well as some great contemporary works like Sakurasou and Raildex. I had hope that this anime would be able to join their echelons. Fantasy is a genre that I have hardly explored but this...show had so much promise to introduce to me a whole new, wonderful world with a smooth, slow, purposeful story that took you in with beautiful imagery and charming characters. That was my hope. And it was shattered.WARNING: DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ANIME, THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.KujiKora is set in a world with a gargantuan ocean of sand. We follow the experiences of people living on a large ship made of mud which is called a ""whale"" which is where our title comes from. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Chakuro - a young archivist living on the ship with several hundred others. Some people - our MC included - possess telekinetic powers called Thymia and are ""Marked"". In exchange for this power they live relatively short lives, rarely going past 30. The ship and its residents have been aimlessly adrift for nearly a hundred years and have never encountered any other people. Whenever another mud ship drifts into view and range, they send people to see whether there is anyone on board as well as to scavenge. There is never anyone on board these rarely encountered foreign ships but, one day, the scavenger group - our MC included - find a girl who turns out to be a soldier for a large empire who sent their own ships to attack and sink their mud ship for reasons that are explained latter into the anime. Thus, begins our thrilling adventure of drama ad suspense while figuring out the secrets of the world.Problem #1: Too many charactersThere\'s a lot of characters in this anime. And I mean a lot. There are about thirty or so named characters in the show. It isn\'t an inherently bad thing that a show has a crap ton of characters in it. Shirobako, for instance, has about twice as many named characters in twice as many episodes and turned out great. Kujikora, however, struggles to juggle between all the characters. A lot of the characters have way too much screen time despite hardly being tertiary characters. It gets so bad that the actual main characters of the show have almost no screen time despite them being the point-of-view characters of the story. The anime does kill of quite a lot of its characters and these are often the characters the anime pushes us to try and form an emotional bond with despite us hardly even knowing them. The anime is simply inept at trying to develop these characters since most of them have one-note personalities and only last around two or three episodes if they\'re lucky. This makes their existence feel so shallow and I could hardly muster up the energy to feel anything for them. It just feels so cheap. So high is the frequency of the show killing off characters that you just know who has a death flag on them. There\'s a lot I can list - more so than I want - but one of the most egregious is in the beginning where they kill off the MC\'s ""love interest"". We hardly know anything about her and her entire character is that she loved the MC. That\'s it. But the anime constantly brings us back to her and her sad story - especially in the first half - that she got annoying fast. Another egregious example would be Ouni\'s friend who gets offed simply to become a plot convenience to ""unlock"" Ouni\'s power as well as to give some cheap backstory which I hardly cared about because he was introduced literally 2 episodes prior. Trust me, these characters might sound like big deals but they really aren’t since so many of them pop up.That\'s another part of the problem: new characters are often introduced seemingly on a whim and they constantly do this throughout the very small number of episodes. A lot of them either end up doing nothing, do very little to further the plot, or and up making the whole thing a lot worse simply by their existence. I understand that this anime is adapted from a manga and that these characters will probably become relevant latter on in the story but in the anime it just feels intrusive. One of the most egregious examples of this happening occurs in episode 8 where two blokes whom we were only introduced to a few episodes prior, and whom were never alluded to – nor had more than 5 minutes of screen time, suddenly came out looking all important and demanding a rebellion of the Marked against the Unmarked. Not only was this conflict never expanded upon or alluded to in any previous episode (something I’ll expand on latter), but these characters were incredibly one-dimensional. The anime expected me to somehow invest myself in them and the conflict but I just cringed throughout the scene. This haphazard and disregard of characters ruins the pacing of the show. It also makes it so that hardly any of the characters have time to develop past their shallow personalities. This ties in with the second problem I have with the show-Problem #2: Poor character writingAs I’ve explained, none of the characters are particularly interesting. This extends from the most insignificant of side characters to the main characters as well as affecting the whole spectrum of bad guys to good guys. The anime’s attempts to make characters be multi-layered and complex end up doing it more harm than good since the show struggles with timekeeping. There are 3 main characters listed on the MAL page for this show but I swear that Suou has the most screentime and he supposedly has a supporting role. The MC is (supposed to be) Chakuro who did have some decent scenes in the first half and had a lot of promise to develop into a stronger, more assertive character after going through all the shit he’s been through. Unfortunately, he hardly changes from his meek attitude he displays at the beginning of the show. This is likely because the creators of the show wanted to contrast him with our other male MC – Ouni. This guy is supposed to the be sort of an edgy anti-villain protagonist with the big power and only helps out the other characters begrudgingly. He unfortunately has very little personality to speak of. His character is reactionary and he never seems to do things on his own violation. Instead, the anime seems to be forcing him to go through with almost all of his actions all for the sake of furthering their shaky plot.  This saddens me since he’s the one with the most motivation in the story. He has a bond with a group of friends whom he considers dear to him, he desires to get off the ship and explore the world, and he has huge power which can have a whole arc built around it. Any of those things could have served as the main driving point for his development but the anime flip flaps between them and never gives him any solid ground on which to build his actions upon. To be fair, his group is made up of a bunch of boring, bland characters who, as explained in problem #1, take up far more screen time than necessary. So, like our first main character, he never really develops at all and seems to be there for the sake of being there. Our third main character is Lykos – the girl who was found on the abandoned ship. She’s kind of alight. She has the second most motivation (and potential) in the show and she doesn’t waste all of it. She serves as the emotionless foil to the emotion-driven people on the mud whale as well as providing a lot of insight in to the world of KujiKora. Her development is the most natural but (I feel like I’m saying “but” way too many times in this review) the anime writes her in such stupid situations it’s sad. In any other anime she’d be forgettable but here, she’s pretty good. Our last character of note is Suou – who isn’t but might as well be a main character. He serves as the Chief of the people on the mud ship and is supposed to be the leader type of guy who takes on responsibility and such. He’s a boring character who also never develops but I feel that he should have been the main character from who’s eyes the story is told from. The anime wastes a lot of his potential wither on melodrama or stupid slapstick comedy (problem #3 coming up) and he has very little impact on the story despite being the goddamn Chief of the place. The story always seems to blow straight past him which is a bit of a shame since he has the second most development.The villains of KujiKora are hilariously bad. The main one we’ll be seeing is the anime’s attempt at making a crazy character – Liontari. He’s basically someone who failed the audition to become the main character of Neo Yokio and after seeing he lost to Jaden Smith, he went mad and joined the army just to kill some people. That was a joke but it’s still a better, and more impactful, motivation than he was given in the show. What a shame as well since I think Liontari would fit in perfectly in the comedy genre that is Neo Yokio because I for the love of me can’t take him seriously. He’s the anime’s attempt at making a sympathetic villain and he’s given a lot of backstory and such as to why he’s the crazy guy he is. The anime, however, can’t make him imposing in any sort of way and he instead comes off as a comedic villain while he’s busy doing really despicable things. That sort of mood dissonance is not healthy for the body I’ll tell you that. His “development” comes late and feels very rushed and contrived. He, like many of the other characters, has a lot of potential in character interactions but he’s never really given any chance to change or anything. The worst part is that he’s got almost as much plot armour as Brie Larson and seemingly can’t be killed off. He sticks around with us like a zit and overstays his welcome up to the very end in the anime’s attempt to bait a second season. I would love to say he’s the only villain of the show since it would beneficially limit the conflict and world of KujiKora to only him and his fellow soldiers and the people on the mud ship. The anime can then be free to make express it’s themes on a much larger scale than the physical setting it is built up on. Uuuuunfortunately (I’m also using that word a lot in this review) this anime tries to make its world on a scale as large as the themes it tries to present. The world building problems will be explained in problem #4 but I’ll explain the crappy side effect that is the overarching main villain of the show. The main villain is introduced early on but only gets proper writing very late into the show. And I mean around episode 10 kind of late. He’s just your generic villain who the anime tries to make imposing but he has so little time to develop. Again, this is likely the anime baiting us a second season, or telling us to screw off and read the manga – both things which are big problems in their own right. His actual character doesn’t bother me too much – he’s simply your generic bad guy as I’ve said. What does bother me is that his very presence is detrimental to the show. The introduction of a much grander conflict so late into the show blasts away what was left of the pacing beforehand and he introduces us to the incredibly boring world of politics. The anime should never have adapted his part in and probably should have ended just before his big introduction.Problem #3: Tone deafnessThis anime has a big problem with its tone. It just can’t keep anything straight. There are many parts in the show where serious exposition is being delivered but then they have many of the (useless) side characters start cracking jokes. They don’t even bother changing the serious music. This is a result of the anime trying way too hard to juggle about a dozen different themes that it clearly couldn’t in just 12 episodes. Many themes are introduced throughout the show including but not limited to: horrors of war, the conscription of children to fight out of desperation, what it means to kill someone, not running away from a cursed fate, how having emotions is better, wanting to explore the outside world and rebel against a closed society (basically Ouni\'s character in a nutshell), love and grief, the burden of revenge as well as taking on responsibility, the importance of leaving behind records for future generations to find etc. That was long but trust me it feels longer watching the anime try and play out these themes. It feels very disorienting whenever they bring up these serious questions and themes before immediately dropping them in favour of another. It makes everything feel so inconsequential. For example, the people on the mud whale have to conscript little children to fight against the invading force sent to slaughter them. That is one thing but the other is that this is supposed to be a peaceful society who has never seen fighting the entire century they have been adrift AND the explicitly go out of their way to teach people not to use their powers to hurt others. What I expected was a sort of commentary on the desperation of the people and how being forced to use innocent children to fight can be a hopeless situation. But no. These kids are all too happy to shoot arrows and kill the faceless goons. Heck, they even have fun while they’re at it. They don’t address it either. They just SHOW them having fun killing the goons. There are no repercussions for the kids. There are absolutely no consequences for the people who basically forced the kids to kill. None. The worse the adults get is that they feel guilty about it while deliberating on the conscription. The anime just sweeps it away once it is done and offers nothing deeper to think about.Problem #4: Lack of coherent story tellingAll the various problems with the characters and its themes lead to the storytelling being completely shot. There is almost a total disregard for pacing in the show thanks to the numerous characters being poorly introduced. Things either crawl at a snail’s pace or they give you whiplash with random new developments. This is especially prevalent near the end when we are suddenly whisked away to the random Empire that is trying to sink our main characters. It suddenly introduces politics in an anime that was never good at politics in the first place. There are way too many plot contrivances in this anime and there’s very little foreshadowing of anything that is to happen. Stuff like the furrball pet suddenly being an important plot point feels ridiculously hammed in because the writers wrote themselves into a corner and couldn’t think of a way to move the plot forward. The stupid friend of Ouni being stupid and wanting to go on the trip felt so inauthentic that I was bashing my head against the desk at the anime’s sheer bravado at trying to move the story forward with such an obvious death flag. It feels like the people writing this show had to refer to a set of guidelines when writing this show instead of actually thinking about the actions and consequences of the story.#5 Final thoughts (aka tl;dr)This anime is not good. The themes are messy and are all over the place, the characters are uninteresting, there’s too many characters, the anime tries to gobble up way more than it could, and the story itself is somewhat generic and one I’ve seen in better fantasy settings. This anime reminds me of Shinsekai Yori. Shinsekai Yori, in case you’ve never watched it, is not a particularly well-written show. It struggles with pacing, there’s a lot of characters I didn’t care much about, the themes were messy – very much like KujiKora. The characters having powers is also a major similarity. So why do I give that a 7/10 and this a 3/10? Shinsekai Yori actually manages to create a world I became invested in. It did this by turning many of its faults into points that drove the anime forward. Lack of pacing? It doesn’t care. Use that infamous exposition episode to naturally build the world. Less-than-stellar character writing? Don’t make characters play very important roles and sideline them which makes the feeling of desperation when shit hits the fan all the more full of dread. Shinsekai Yori managed to create a cohesive world that made sense and feels like it has rules. KujiKora simply feels confused at what its supposed to do and can’t remember any of the groundwork of rules on which it is built upon. It fails at being a compelling, densely-themed story and it fails at building a proper word of fantasy. I have never been so disappointed watching an anime.KujiKora should serve as a warning to any prospective writers that you should never try to bite off way more than you could chew. Harsh criticisms aside this anime really had a lot of potential. This incoherent mess does have a lot of things that I would like if they did them right. I love a good fantasy show and was hugely expecting this anime – especially since it came from one of the most consistent studios in the past two decades. This anime, however, is not what they should be doing.Thanks for reading! show had so much promise to introduce to me a whole new, wonderful world with a smooth, slow, purposeful story that took you in with beautiful imagery and charming characters.

This guy is supposed to the be sort of an edgy anti-villain protagonist with the big power and only helps out the other characters begrudgingly. He unfortunately has very little personality to speak of. His character is reactionary and he never seems to do things on his own violation. Instead, the anime seems to be forcing him to go through with almost all of his actions all for the sake of furthering their shaky plot.  This saddens me since he’s the one with the most motivation in the story. He has a bond with a group of friends whom he considers dear to him, he desires to get off the ship and explore the world, and he has huge power which can have a whole arc built around it. Any of those things could have served as the main driving point for his development but the anime flip flaps between them and never gives him any solid ground on which to build his actions upon. To be fair, his group is made up of a bunch of boring, bland characters who, as explained in problem #1, take up far more screen time than necessary. So, like our first main character, he never really develops at all and seems to be there for the sake of being there. Our third main character is Lykos – the girl who was found on the abandoned ship. She’s kind of alight. She has the second most motivation (and potential) in the show and she doesn’t waste all of it. She serves as the emotionless foil to the emotion-driven people on the mud whale as well as providing a lot of insight in to the world of KujiKora. Her development is the most natural but (I feel like I’m saying “but” way too many times in this review) the anime writes her in such stupid situations it’s sad. In any other anime she’d be forgettable but here, she’s pretty good. Our last character of note is Suou – who isn’t but might as well be a main character. He serves as the Chief of the people on the mud ship and is supposed to be the leader type of guy who takes on responsibility and such. He’s a boring character who also never develops but I feel that he should have been the main character from who’s eyes the story is told from. The anime wastes a lot of his potential wither on melodrama or stupid slapstick comedy (problem #3 coming up) and he has very little impact on the story despite being the goddamn Chief of the place. The story always seems to blow straight past him which is a bit of a shame since he has the second most development.The villains of KujiKora are hilariously bad. The main one we’ll be seeing is the anime’s attempt at making a crazy character – Liontari. He’s basically someone who failed the audition to become the main character of Neo Yokio and after seeing he lost to Jaden Smith, he went mad and joined the army just to kill some people. That was a joke but it’s still a better, and more impactful, motivation than he was given in the show. What a shame as well since I think Liontari would fit in perfectly in the comedy genre that is Neo Yokio because I for the love of me can’t take him seriously. He’s the anime’s attempt at making a sympathetic villain and he’s given a lot of backstory and such as to why he’s the crazy guy he is. The anime, however, can’t make him imposing in any sort of way and he instead comes off as a comedic villain while he’s busy doing really despicable things. That sort of mood dissonance is not healthy for the body I’ll tell you that. His “development” comes late and feels very rushed and contrived. He, like many of the other characters, has a lot of potential in character interactions but he’s never really given any chance to change or anything. The worst part is that he’s got almost as much plot armour as Brie Larson and seemingly can’t be killed off. He sticks around with us like a zit and overstays his welcome up to the very end in the anime’s attempt to bait a second season. I would love to say he’s the only villain of the show since it would beneficially limit the conflict and world of KujiKora to only him and his fellow soldiers and the people on the mud ship. The anime can then be free to make express it’s themes on a much larger scale than the physical setting it is built up on. Uuuuunfortunately (I’m also using that word a lot in this review) this anime tries to make its world on a scale as large as the themes it tries to present. The world building problems will be explained in problem #4 but I’ll explain the crappy side effect that is the overarching main villain of the show. The main villain is introduced early on but only gets proper writing very late into the show. And I mean around episode 10 kind of late. He’s just your generic villain who the anime tries to make imposing but he has so little time to develop. Again, this is likely the anime baiting us a second season, or telling us to screw off and read the manga – both things which are big problems in their own right. His actual character doesn’t bother me too much – he’s simply your generic bad guy as I’ve said. What does bother me is that his very presence is detrimental to the show. The introduction of a much grander conflict so late into the show blasts away what was left of the pacing beforehand and he introduces us to the incredibly boring world of politics. The anime should never have adapted his part in and probably should have ended just before his big introduction.Problem #3: Tone deafnessThis anime has a big problem with its tone. It just can’t keep anything straight. There are many parts in the show where serious exposition is being delivered but then they have many of the (useless) side characters start cracking jokes. They don’t even bother changing the serious music. This is a result of the anime trying way too hard to juggle about a dozen different themes that it clearly couldn’t in just 12 episodes. Many themes are introduced throughout the show including but not limited to: horrors of war, the conscription of children to fight out of desperation, what it means to kill someone, not running away from a cursed fate, how having emotions is better, wanting to explore the outside world and rebel against a closed society (basically Ouni\'s character in a nutshell), love and grief, the burden of revenge as well as taking on responsibility, the importance of leaving behind records for future generations to find etc. That was long but trust me it feels longer watching the anime try and play out these themes. It feels very disorienting whenever they bring up these serious questions and themes before immediately dropping them in favour of another. It makes everything feel so inconsequential. For example, the people on the mud whale have to conscript little children to fight against the invading force sent to slaughter them. That is one thing but the other is that this is supposed to be a peaceful society who has never seen fighting the entire century they have been adrift AND the explicitly go out of their way to teach people not to use their powers to hurt others. What I expected was a sort of commentary on the desperation of the people and how being forced to use innocent children to fight can be a hopeless situation. But no. These kids are all too happy to shoot arrows and kill the faceless goons. Heck, they even have fun while they’re at it. They don’t address it either. They just SHOW them having fun killing the goons. There are no repercussions for the kids. There are absolutely no consequences for the people who basically forced the kids to kill. None. The worse the adults get is that they feel guilty about it while deliberating on the conscription. The anime just sweeps it away once it is done and offers nothing deeper to think about.Problem #4: Lack of coherent story tellingAll the various problems with the characters and its themes lead to the storytelling being completely shot. There is almost a total disregard for pacing in the show thanks to the numerous characters being poorly introduced. Things either crawl at a snail’s pace or they give you whiplash with random new developments. This is especially prevalent near the end when we are suddenly whisked away to the random Empire that is trying to sink our main characters. It suddenly introduces politics in an anime that was never good at politics in the first place. There are way too many plot contrivances in this anime and there’s very little foreshadowing of anything that is to happen. Stuff like the furrball pet suddenly being an important plot point feels ridiculously hammed in because the writers wrote themselves into a corner and couldn’t think of a way to move the plot forward. The stupid friend of Ouni being stupid and wanting to go on the trip felt so inauthentic that I was bashing my head against the desk at the anime’s sheer bravado at trying to move the story forward with such an obvious death flag. It feels like the people writing this show had to refer to a set of guidelines when writing this show instead of actually thinking about the actions and consequences of the story.#5 Final thoughts (aka tl;dr)This anime is not good. The themes are messy and are all over the place, the characters are uninteresting, there’s too many characters, the anime tries to gobble up way more than it could, and the story itself is somewhat generic and one I’ve seen in better fantasy settings. This anime reminds me of Shinsekai Yori. Shinsekai Yori, in case you’ve never watched it, is not a particularly well-written show. It struggles with pacing, there’s a lot of characters I didn’t care much about, the themes were messy – very much like KujiKora. The characters having powers is also a major similarity. So why do I give that a 7/10 and this a 3/10? Shinsekai Yori actually manages to create a world I became invested in. It did this by turning many of its faults into points that drove the anime forward. Lack of pacing? It doesn’t care. Use that infamous exposition episode to naturally build the world. Less-than-stellar character writing? Don’t make characters play very important roles and sideline them which makes the feeling of desperation when shit hits the fan all the more full of dread. Shinsekai Yori managed to create a cohesive world that made sense and feels like it has rules. KujiKora simply feels confused at what its supposed to do and can’t remember any of the groundwork of rules on which it is built upon. It fails at being a compelling, densely-themed story and it fails at building a proper word of fantasy. I have never been so disappointed watching an anime.KujiKora should serve as a warning to any prospective writers that you should never try to bite off way more than you could chew. Harsh criticisms aside this anime really had a lot of potential. This incoherent mess does have a lot of things that I would like if they did them right. I love a good fantasy show and was hugely expecting this anime – especially since it came from one of the most consistent studios in the past two decades. This anime, however, is not what they should be doing.Thanks for reading!', ""Watch this anime if you cannot decide what to watch or have a lot of time. Give it a try but don't expect too muchAlmost no character development and too slow paced for a 12 episode anime.

In fact, if there was more world to explore it could be quite enjoyable. Instead, the first two episodes are 25 minute expositions that end up doing nothing for the story overall.From that point on the story attempts to pull heart-strings by delving into the debate of logic vs. emotion, and exploiting the death of children to really drive home the point of how gut-wrenching the story is.All in all the story ends up going nowhere while attempting to paint itself...as some kind of amazing piece of art. In short: skip this anime if you can. Its not worth it.Art; I will say that I did enjoy the background art. I do enjoy a unique look, but its completely thrown off by the same-face animation style that has taken over anime in the last 10 years. Netflix itself has a bad habit of using sub-par animation, and this is no exception. While I can\'t get past the animation of the characters, I will give credit to the background images. They were well done and really gave the world life.Overall: Abandon the  mud whale. Not worth the time or energy that went into it. as some kind of amazing piece of art.

Depending on what you like in a show, this anime might either be really enjoyable for you or not enjoyable at all.One thing that is really appealing about Children of the Whales is its setting and world-building, it\'s hard to explain without giving too much away, but there\'s this whole complex story of this sea of sand with various islands called ""whales"" with the inhabitants...on them being divided between those who have special power and those that don\'t. For each society there is a different drawback to having these powers called ""thymia"", for the protagonists it means that their lifespans our significantly shortened, for others it cost them their emotions. I\'m not going to divulge what the cause of this is of course, but there were plenty of surprises, twists and turns that kept me hooked the whole time.While the premise and background are the anime\'s biggest strength, the writing is its biggest weakness. Children of the Whale is surprisingly brutal at times, with a body count among its main cast rivaling many popular war anime, but it seems that the writers of the show were uncertain of how much they should showcase. A lot of the brutality and character deaths were muted and ruined by pointless melodrama, and it seemed as if the show kept trying to cover up how dark it actually was. Pacing was also an issue, some episodes felt overly rushed while others were far too slow. Also, the show relied way too much on exposition, especially in the early episodes.Another aspect of the show negatively affected by the writing were the characters. For its runtime Children of the Whales has a surprisingly large caste, especially among our protagonist\'s society, but their development is haphazard at best. Chakuro is built up to be the main protagonist and Lykos is kind of the poster child of the show, but there were some episodes were neither of them were in it for more than a couple minuets. It is clear that the vigilante Ouni is the most dynamic and complex character in the show, and this is reflected by the fact that he is by far the most popular character, but his development too was uneven at best. Another issue was how unbelievably stupid a lot of the characters acted, aside from the aforementioned Ouni it rarely seemed as if any of the other characters had two brain cells to rub as they were constantly making boneheaded decisions to further the plot.The art for the show was alright, I guess. The whole environment of these islands and people floating on a sea of sand was well conceived of and animated, and the main caste\'s character designs were surprisingly complex. The side character\'s designs though at times bordered on overly simplistic and it was hard to tell them apart, as well as sometimes the background art and the characters seemed to contrast too much, making it look like the characters had simply been pasted on.The music also had its highs and lows, the op and ep didn\'t strike me as overly special at first but they both grew on me over time, to the point that I consider the former one of my top favorite openings now. On the flip side there is this tune one of the characters sings which is really annoying, and there were a few times the music did not gel well at all, there was this one moment that was supposed to be sentimental, but the directors chose to have this upbeat, almost goofy song playing which ruined the moment for me.Children of the Whales touches on some important themes, such as the inevitability of mortality, how complicated morality can be, the fact in war the bad guys sometimes win, and the power of emotions. Yet despite that and its interesting premise, I personally never felt as if the anime ever fully delivered. In fact, there were a couple times, especially after the horrendous episode 10, that I wanted to drop this. Personally, for me it\'s the one anime I feel most conflicted about, and I feel that I like it more for the show it could have been rather than what actually came out. Perhaps it\'s because the anime is a Shoujo and not the Shonen, but I really didn\'t connect with how the themes and ideas were being expressed. Despite that and all the issues I have with Children of the Whales, it did get me interested in the manga, and I am hopefully looking forward if this anime (though unlikely) ever gets a sequel. I very tentatively recommend this if you appreciate intriguing fantasy anime and complex stories, but if you\'re offput by bad writing or missed opportunities then you probably will not enjoy it. on them being divided between those who have special power and those that don\'t.

Here are my thoughts:I\'ll begin with discussing visuals, as this is one of the show\'s best features. This anime consistently looks excellent. Nearly every single frame is screencap-worthy. The art style is unique and has an organic look to it that is quite immersive. There is a lot of variety among the character designs, and most of them look good. The MC is adorable, both in design and personality. Facial expressions are well illustrated and the character animation is consistently good. The creative art style and high visual production...quality really enhance the fantastical setting of this show as well.The setting is another very remarkable aspect of this anime. It is quite unique and otherworldly. It was a major component of my enjoyment. More and more information about the world is gradually revealed throughout the show; it is pretty intriguing and the show does a decent job at world building for a 12-episode runtime. What I can reveal to you without spoilers is that the show takes place in the middle of a \'sand ocean\' aboard some sort of magical ship composed of earthy materials. It is quite cool and fantastical, and the nice visuals really complement it.Even beyond the world building, there are a lot of mystery elements in the show and hints dropped about things not yet revealed. However, as you might cynically expect from a 12-episode manga adaptation, many of the mysteries alluded to the viewer are never explained. Regardless of some of my questions not being answered, I still often felt a sense of intrigue while watching. The writer clearly had some fascinating ideas. Also worth mentioning is that the ending is not particularly satisfying and leaves a ton of loose plot strings. The last episode indicates an upcoming sequel (and I did watch the Blurays), but at the time of writing this I\'m not aware of any sequels.One of this show\'s most significant issues is the size of its cast. The enormous cast with this limited runtime is not a good combination, especially in an already plot-heavy show with a lot of exposition. This anime tries to balance way too many character arcs, and none of them are done particularly well as a result. Compounding this issue further is the fact that it\'s difficult to feel emotions for characters who are not given adequate development, or barely any screentime at all for that matter. A common criticism that I\'ve heard from others about this show is that it is too ""melodramatic."" I would argue that this feeling of so-called melodrama described by others is the result of phenomena I\'ve just outlined: emotionally impactful events happening to inadequately developed characters. In any case it is true that the show is dramatic. Most episodes involve somebody crying at some point. If frequent tears is something that puts you off then you likely won\'t enjoy this anime. It definitely lays on the drama heavy (that\'s certainly not an issue for me personally). Apparently the source material is shoujo demographic, although it felt much more cosmopolitan than that to me. One subtle but praiseworthy aspect of this anime is that it maintains a fairly consistent emotional tone. I was grateful for the absence of comedic relief and minimal \'emotional whiplash\' effects.Beyond the characters, the show tries to tackle a bewildering amount of story arcs, in addition to the already elaborate world building. Simply put, the show tries to pack way too much story into its runtime, and as a result none of the story arcs are executed particularly well. The divided attention of the viewer and lack of sufficient screentime meant that any resulting emotional payoff from a given story arc was significantly impeded. To me, this is a core reason for this anime\'s squandered potential. I think you won\'t be surprised to read that I found the show\'s overall pacing way too quick, particularly during the later episodes.Although they weren\'t present in every episode, I found the fight scenes to be a weak point of this anime. They were fairly lackluster and, even worse, drawn out and soaked up a lot of precious screentime. I\'m really not sure why so much screentime was allocated to these fight scenes. Regardless of the execution, it was disappointing to see such a unique creative show devolve into mundane violent conflict. I realize that the kinetic conflict was a mechanism to explore the themes of the writing, but I wish it was approached a different way. However, my opinion on this is definitely biased due to my general distaste for fight scenes. It\'s possible I\'m overstating their significance.The OST seemed decent but I\'ll need to listen to it in isolation to evaluate it with greater confidence. I know there were some good tracks, but it was mostly overshadowed by dialogue and sound effects (like sandstorm background noise), at least from my perspective. In terms of voice acting, nobody in this large cast impressed me or stood out (besides Ouni\'s sexy deep voice).My overall rating: 7/10This anime has a truly unique setting along with some intriguing world building, and it\'s all presented with a wonderful organic-looking art style. It consistently looks fantastic. Unfortunately, it suffers from unfocused storytelling and poor screentime budgeting. It tries to present far too much story content for its runtime, and sadly as a result none of the story arcs realize their impressive potential.A lot of this anime\'s issues could have been diminished if it were two cours instead of a mere 12 episodes. Most of its flaws are common manga-adaptation problems.Despite my criticisms, I think that a lot of people could enjoy this anime. There are a lot of aspects here worth appreciating.

This is thanks to a alright yet very familiar story.Story (6/10)The story concentrates on the people of the Mud Whale, an island drifting an ocean of sand. They discover a girl who turns the whole world of the Mud Whale upside down.The first two episodes really didn't do much for me and almost made me consider dropping this show, the artstyle, music and the world of the Mud Whale itself had me interested....The characters were the main problem, they were just bland as hell, thankfully the ending of episode 2 kept me on board and I don't regret it too much.Episode 3 and beyond changed everything, it's development changed the show from being mediocrely sweet to surprisingly dark. The fact that a new human civilisation had come to destroy the people of the Mud Whale was pretty hectic and seeing characters, who I thought would have a big role, die was also surprising.However once you get past the initial battle and the people on the Mud Whale try to recover and build up for another attack it does slow down again. Then it picks back up again once the next battle arrives, I was entertained for a good while as the battle got more and more brutal for the Mud Whale people, plus there were some pretty cool battle scenes between certain characters.When we reach the final episodes though, the direction of the show shifts immensely as other human factions are introduced and we see the scope of the world itself, which leads us to our cliffhanger end of the series, although with the way things were going this seemed inevitable.I did like the emotional split between the human factions, as having emotions was a bad thing and not having them was good. I enjoyed this aspect and gave more weight for the opposing sides, however this setup felt way too familiar to Attack on Titan. I mean think about it, a secluded bunch of humans being attacked by a larger faction of humans because they have a specific trait that is wrong to the rest of the world sounds very familiar.Despite this, I am a little surprised how this anime managed to narrowly escape me dropping it.Characters (5/10)The main problem of this anime, is the characters, true there is a whole emotional war going on, but when you can't make your characters feel interesting then whats the damn point of them.Chakuro is the male MC, an expressively emotional guy who is very interested about the world he lives in, Chakuro just didn't do much for me as a character. Sure he has an adventurous spirit, but most of the time he actually doesn't do a whole lot. He just points out certain things and obtains certain things, because story plot I guess. By the end of the series I felt barely any different of him than I did at the beginning.Lykos is the female MC, ok I get that she is from a race of people who have discarded emotions, but come on she was another boring character. Although not as bad as Chakuro since you see her slowly develop emotions again over the course of the show, which gave her some development, but she didn't do anything either. She just felt like a character for Chakuro to hold hands with.Ouni felt like the only character, who was actually worth a damn in this show. He already seemed like an emotionless person from the get go, but as he starts fighting against the enemy and starts losing the people he cares about, you really see the devastation erupt from him and he starts to care more for the people of the Mud Whale instead of being an outcast. True his overpowered legacy is a little cliche, but I'm willing to put that aside since he was an actual badass character.I'll also talk about Suou since he felt like a major character, I thought he was alright since he had the difficult job of being the new mayor of the Mud Whale when the previous one died in the first attack. He tries his best to find peaceful solutions that will keep everyone alive and even when this doesn't happen he still stand up to the enemy so he can protect the others. Suou was a very respectable character compared to others.There was a lot of supporting characters, but they don't seem worth the mention since they were only there for a specific role and that was it really, however it did surprise me with certain characters who ended up dying.Art (8/10)I have to give credit where credit is due, because Children of the Whales was a beautifully made show, there was barely any notice of CGI apart from a few cases, but the detail put into the Mud Whale and the scenery was applaudable, it looked fantastic. I also liked the roughness of the characters look too, it gave off a unique feel I haven't seen for a while in an anime.I think the artstyle is what kept me watching the show mostly, as there were so many scenes you could look at and pick apart how good the animation and background was, like for example the scene where Ouni sees one of his friends die and he sees his spirit sail away or when Chakuro receives a weird object from one of the enemies creature thingies. These are just a few examples, but it proved how good looking the show was.Sound (7/10)The sound was also done pretty well too. The OP felt like it was made to fool you into thinking this was a happy show, sure there are moments where you see certain characters arming themselves for action, but you don't know what for and the happy tune the op has along with the scenes being shown helped really well with covering the true nature of the show.The ED was also really nice too, it had a calm, but sad feeling to it and this definitely fitted for the later episodes when everything gets brutal with the battles and everything. I also liked how it just showed the ocean of sand like there was an infinite bleakness to it as well.The ost also felt magnificently done too, the scenes where it felt calm, sad or something amazing was happening the music just kicked in at the right moment and had some really powerful stuff.Extras:The fantasy setting this anime has was pretty interesting, seeing people on an island that is endlessly drifting an ocean of sand until another human civilisation comes and destroys everything they knew, however this is a little ruined when you compare it to Attack on Titan, but I'll give it points for coming up with a fairly unique setting.The mystery element in the show, kinda falls short as we get a lot of stuff thrown at us, but not a lot of it is explained. Like for example the weird creatures we see that take human emotion or don't in the case of the Mud Whale, these creatures are a big part of the show, we just don't get a lot of exposition of them which is probably being saved for the sequel.Enjoyment (6/10)I'd say this is a fairly mixed show, but it felt more positive than negative. The characters are really what lets the show down, but it had it's moments of surprise.Overall (6/10)Overall this show had something, but didn't really do a whole lot with it. We get an interesting world, but sadly it felt strangely familiar to another anime, however I am interested in where the sequel series will go. The characters were the main problem, they were just bland as hell, thankfully the ending of episode 2 kept me on board and I don't regret it too much.Episode 3 and beyond changed everything, it's development changed the show from being mediocrely sweet to surprisingly dark.

While a great deal was never explained outright, enough was explained that I felt moved by the story, and Chakuro and his friends were brilliant characters that I was rooting for the entire time.The colours and lighting in this show are part of what makes it so good. It's a very emotional story that relies on silence, emotional beats, and what is left unsaid, but it works rather well. Not only that, but the concept of the magic, as well as what it does to the people of the Mud Whale,...was incredibly unique and something I enjoyed watching and seeing.And I will freely admit that Ouni is one of my favourite characters in the entire thing.

Really hoping we get a second season for this."", 'I am quite new to reviewing anime series, although I am certainly not new to watching them. I will try to write a brief review that does not divulge anything essential. I was intrigued by the dystopian promise of this series (other reviewers have called the series ""utopian,"" but ""dystopia,"" I think, describes better the world the anime presents). The main problem for me at this point (Season 1 being over) appears to be twofold: 1) the series does not handle well the emotional excess it piles up rather quickly and all too abruptly and, as a result, often blends melodrama with bizarre farce that...seems quite out of place; 2) The changes in plot direction are too sudden, leading to patchy characterization and to some alarming inability to make characters find/fit their environment. At best, it is as if the 12 episodes were used to create a basis for sequels that are supposed to do all of the/most of the work. Having to wait considerable time for a sequel to come, I find this approach unsatisfying.The premise of this anime series, by the way, is very familiar, although its setting is somewhat unusual. Without revealing too much, I hope, I will mention that it shares plenty of similarities with a long line of dystopian narratives that have shaped our experience of imagining an altered and troubled Earth, living a life of illusion and false nirvana. From the works of H.G. Wells, Zamyatin, Wyndham, and Orwell through Lanier and Brosnan, there is a strange world out there that carries precarious beauty which comes with an awful price to pay. The creators of クジラの子らは砂上に歌う, however, opted to reveal the ugly face of brutal reality way too soon and, in my opinion, sabotaged the promise and the enchanting/mysterious qualities of the early episodes. Rather than building a world where characters can grow and acquire depth, they tried to shatter all and rebuild from there, but in doing so resorted to farce, to haphazard inclusion of newcomers and non-engaging characters, and to some strange pacing that alternated between apathy and frenzy.Overall, I am disappointed with this series. Its premise was familiar, but suggested a somewhat unique angle of the ""After Earth"" narrative; its absence of a strong protagonist, its tendency to mix up innocents and psychopaths, gore and prayer, chant and mania, spoiled most of the fun for me. Its visuals are good but not exceptional, and they are also a tad too curious: static, almost sketch-like landscapes clash with the colors/tones used for the inhabitants and their actions.Having said all this, I have certainly seen much weaker series, but expected a lot more from this one. Final grade: 5/10. seems quite out of place; 2) The changes in plot direction are too sudden, leading to patchy characterization and to some alarming inability to make characters find/fit their environment.

This is where I would like to do the show some justice.This anime is the tale of the descendants of a group of people who refused to become the mindless puppets of a central authority. For...this, they were banished from their homeland, and sent into a prison they could not possibly escape. What is more, their rebellion against the central power has been demonized in the historybooks of the mainland, where they are presented as fiendish brutes.(an oddly familiar way of treating the voice of dissent)All in all, I think the premise of the show is set quite spendidly. While later on other elements, like the importance of emotions (i feel that the quote from Hamlet is quite pertinent here: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep No more), become important as well, the story does not neglect its original aim of depicting how a repressive authority works.Into this grand setting embedded is a magical place with its unique characters and laws of nature. I personally liked the characters, they were just as 'colourful' as you would expect humans to be, with their uncertainties and internal struggles, along episodes of heroism and courage.I think the show addresses some very interesting topics, which will surely have those thinking who have the desire to do so. this, they were banished from their homeland, and sent into a prison they could not possibly escape.

There are many memories that you wish you forgot, there are those that are bittersweet, funny, ridiculous; an amalgam of emotions and thoughts. You are going on a journey of enlightenment with patience and endurance for whatever comes in the way. Suddenly, the staircase ends and you are not even close to the surface. You start pondering whether your quest of reaching the top was fruitful or completely for naught. You consider waiting for the rest of the staircase to appear and keep...on the manner with which you started. However, you realize that no matter how much you wait, you will never escape. That is my impression of Children of the Whales in a nutshell.It is rare that I find anime that I was genuinely disappointed with. Usually, my disappointment is attributed to anime that seemed from the beginning that they were not planning to go anywhere and even in that case, I was still expecting it. Unfortunately, there are some that have the potential to make a difference and stand out from the norm in their own way, such as shows as Shinsekai Yori which came out at the worst time possible. But, it managed to leave a mark in the industry and surpass the mediocre and its concurrently airing mainstream anime. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case for Children of the Whales, which although started with a lot of promise on its original concept and lore and development on certain characters, ended on the worst point possible in a story.I was surprised by the implementation of greek in the names of people outside of the island and how much effort was put into building up the lore surrounding the Mud Whale and the rest of the Unknown World. But, the moment Rochalito introduced himself, I stopped taking the use of greek seriously due to how ridiculous it is to give a character the name ""Snore"" and how the mangaka ran out of animals to name people. Otherwise, Children of the Whales was building up to be a war drama and then it changed tangent to an adventure anime with soap opera drama. And that is the first issue with the story: tonal shifts. The show did not know how to handle emotionally heavy moments and blend them well with calmer and comedic ones. It is not as bad as the tonal whiplash was in Akame ga Kill! but it was still really jarring at some moments. Also, that had an effect on the pacing of the show, which started going a lot faster from episode 4 onwards and after episode 9 it became slower than molasses. The ending itself was a representation of what the whole show was: a hot, messy Sloppy Jo sandwich; tasty, but still messy. This is also a qualm I have before watching 12 episode anime series: they are usually too short and towards the end, they get even messier than they started.Frankly, the lore behind the actual plot of Children of the Whales is innately rich. It explores how people could use Thymia and why it has specific effects, the truth behind the hearts of the lands called ""Nous"". In the anime, all of these concepts are explained and revealed in a rather subtle manner instead of being bombarded to the audience with symbolism and/or in a preachy manner.But, even the lore, in the end, is incomplete, because the show is cut short and everything feels just like a small introduction. If the lore had not been so interesting, I may have quitted the show before it ended. Yet, it still feels like wasted potential.To make a long diatribe on the characters of the show short, most of them are archetypical or underdeveloped or uninteresting with the worst being Chakuro, the main protagonist of the show. He is your typical Xerox Kaneki protagonist who does nothing useful and he does not change at all as a character. He remains the crybaby he was despite having to go through horrible events at such a tender age of 14 years old. I swear that if Lykos was not a character in the show, the characters would mean nothing to me. Thankfully, she is easily the best character of the show, since she starts as your typical apathetic killing machine and she evolves to a caring and emotional person who is mindful of the people she wants to protect. But, Suou, Ouni and the rest are just not interesting and too underdeveloped for me to sympathize with or remotely care about them.The only areas that the show stands out without a lot of stuff to talk about are the art and the soundtrack. The show is breaming with style and the directing is spot on as expected from the director of other anime series, such as Occultic;Nine. The CG sand and thymia fit the show mostly seamlessly but there are a few moments where the characters feel like cardboard placed on top of the screen than actual 2D figures. There were many risks taken with the art style and animation of the show and luckily it mostly paid off. There were a few moments in the show and in the OP where I was impressed with how beautiful it looked. Overall, it is shown how J.C. STAFF with the right directors and animators can pull off high-tier productions better than other studios, such as A1 Pictures.From the soundtrack, only the song found in the preview stood out the most, but it is just a decent track. The OP and ED songs attached to the show are beautiful and easily one of my favorites for the Fall season. They remind me of what the show could have been; emotional, dramatic, suspensful and meaningful as a journey.In its entirety, Children of the Whales is just a decent sci-fi that screams potential with its rich lore and good production values, but decides to end as another short adverisement for the manga with more questions than it could handle. I am still glad that I watched it, but the journey made it sure unworhtwile to reach the end which was unsatisfying and aggravating. on the manner with which you started.

While there is indeed much to be desired, the anime does not pretend to be about either of these things.In a word of magic and gifted children who are ruled by elders without similar abilities, Children of the Whales does not pretend to be about childish friendships or silly moments growing up. Instead, they dive right in with a character who is misinformed yet eager for proper answers. And a system set up to ensure he is constantly shielded from them.The anime...is gripping, not only because the bright colours (might I add here that each character on the Mud Whale is named after Japanese colours) contrast almost sickeningly to the content, or that the theme songs, especially the closing one, is haunting and written to perfectly fit the mood one feels after an episode. The anime tackles how these children respond and are affected when they must decide: allow their home to be taken and destroyed or fight a war.With characters representing almost every viewpoint that may fit this topic, Children of the Whales presents a story where children are called on to make sacrifices, are harmed, grow and develop with one another. Quick warning though, don’t get too attached to any character. The anime is not afraid to remind its viewers that war is a nasty game and on the Mud Whale, not even the children are safe. is gripping, not only because the bright colours (might I add here that each character on the Mud Whale is named after Japanese colours) contrast almost sickeningly to the content, or that the theme songs, especially the closing one, is haunting and written to perfectly fit the mood one feels after an episode. The anime tackles how these children respond and are affected when they must decide: allow their home to be taken and destroyed or fight a war.With characters representing almost every viewpoint that may fit this topic, Children of the Whales presents a story where children are called on to make sacrifices, are harmed, grow and develop with one another.

From the absolutely stunning production value to the mesmerizing music to the soft-spoken narrative, it\'s the quintessential Ghibli-esque experience you can ask for in an anime. The key difference, I would argue, is that Children of the Whales is a very sad tale-- quite possibly a tragedy if you look at it in a certain way, where...it offers more mature and dark themes than Miyazaki\'s work. Basically, Children of the Whales\' atmosphere is comparable to Miyazaki, but the takeaway message is not.This anime was also a breath of fresh air as its magical realism is something I\'ve never seen before. Again, comparable to Miyazaki\'s works, there is a paramount of magic and whimsical worldbuilding without adhering to the technicalities of how and why things work. You simply get immersed in this wonderful fantastical journey.The characters, while nothing groundbreaking here, are likable and serve their purpose. They have satisfying arcs and they all feel like well rounded, 3-dimensional people. They go through your typical internal conflicts (ex. questioning the world around them and their individual identity) in a very gratifying way that highlights impressive character development in only a short span of 12 episodes. it offers more mature and dark themes than Miyazaki\'s work.

In my eyes, they all seem like idiots, who lack the brain to think probably. For example, if you can't understand what I mean, they could have told everyone on the island that the Elders are trying to sink the island. Other than this I would say the story itself is pretty interesting, despite those retardedness actions taken by the characters. The art is also pretty good, so as the music.It's something decent to watch with your brain turned off, but...other than that, don't waste your time on it. other than that, don't waste your time on it."", 'It is weird how a such with such an interesting synopsis and world, could be this boring.- The plot line for this show sounded fascinating to me and I jumped at the chance to watch it. And whilst it did deliver everything it promised...it was incredibly boring. The world itself was extremely interesting and creative. It presented this scenario and all these questions started to pop up in my mind like ""who are they and why are they here?"" but even though by then end of the show these questions were answered, I think I fell asleep twice during it. It takes talent to present...such an interesting story in such a boring way it makes you sleep.- Art and Sound were very good, nothing to comment on.- After much thought, I think its the characters to blame all this dullness on. But even still I\'m not too sure. The main was a bit cliche and the main supporting girl character was also nothing special...in fact, I don\'t think any character was really memorable.

What doesn\'t work in Kujira no Kora is a set: screen time, character development, plot, and the ending.- About screen time: 12 episodes are almost nothing for what anime sets out to do: touch the heart of the watcher and arouse their curiosity about the backgrounds of both the story and the characters. It turns out that everything turned out to be very hurried and unorganized. The first episode (no spoiler) is boring. Drab and...does not have many elements that make the viewer keep watching. The screen time for each thing was poorly divided. They can\'t decide if an episode will be to develop things X and Y or if it will develop Z.- Character Development: It is expected that if the anime has 2 or 3 protagonists, they will all be developed as the story progresses, but this is not the case. Each character looks pretty shallow in any aspect other than the look. The protagonist started one way and ended the same way. Who still had a little development was the protagonist (lykos), but so little. The secondary cast has plenty of potential to show various characteristics about themselves, but they get lost amid the short screen time and the pressure and need for a drama to be broadcast to the viewer.There are a lot of deaths over the course of these 12 episodes, but I couldn\'t care about any since I didn\'t have time to become fond of any characters other than the protagonists. There is the use of flashbacks on some major killings for the main cast, but it\'s so short-lived and so misused that it didn\'t even get all my attention or emotion.- Plot: Any story without a minimum of plot base does not work. Kujira\'s problem in Kora is the opposite. There are many attempts to insert a grand plot that captivates the audience and gets some prominence. The first episode, in plot terms, is what works best in the entire anime. I watched the 12 episodes released and I\'m not sure which story the anime wanted and wants to tell. The story throws several questions and answers almost none, as it did not have time for that, as the concern was to kill undeveloped characters to force the drama on the viewer.-The Final: I will not spoil the final episodes of Kujira no Kora. I just wanted to reserve a space to say the ending was bad. And they still tried to leave it with a ""we need a second season"" mood, but failed miserably. Wow, from episode 10 the course is different.

So why has it turned out to be bad so far?Story:The story is wonderful, you can clearly see the author put time into fleshing out what the Mud Whale is and the world around it. The mysteries of the Mud Whale pull you in and it makes you want to know what happens next. Will they survive on the Mud Whale, or abandon it? Will the Empire eliminate them all, or will they escape and defy them? Although the pacing is a bit strange it\'s bearable. 7/10Art:This anime\'s art style...is quite fresh, it\'s a nice change when all you have this season is cookie-cutter animation. I don\'t really have anything else to say other than they did a really good job with the art. 9/10Sound:The music is amazing, it pulls you in from episode one. It immerses you even more because it feels like the music actually belongs to the world, like it was created there. 10/10Now, the sole reason I stopped watching this disappointing show.Characters:The characters are absolute garbage, most of them are introduced just to be killed off (Sami for example) in the first episodes without us even being able to become attached to them.Chakuro is one of worst characters I\'ve ever seen. This feminine crybaby is what killed this show for me. So many times did I have to listen to his whiny little monologues about how ""this is bad!"" and ""i don\'t like that!""Never once has this little piece of human garbage ever stand up for himself, he simply just cries, and cries, and f*%king cries.Why isn\'t Lykos the MC?! She actually does stuff other than sit around and cry! Even Sami would have been a better MC then Chakuro. 2/10Overall, if you like characters that whine and have others do everything for them, this is the show for you. I really did want to like this show, but the characters hold it back, if you want to watch it for the story then just read the manga instead, Chakuro crying is kinda bearable then. 5/10 is quite fresh, it\'s a nice change when all you have this season is cookie-cutter animation.

The concept and world is unique to itself and it would without a doubt present a nice change of pace against other works. Also worth noting that it looks pretty to look at It, it\'s not the best looking, but it definitely pleasant to look at.However, this is where the positives draw the line upon the rest of the 12 episode run of the series, and you immediately notice it upon reaching the second and third episodes.|-Downs-|Red Flag - This...anime presents the perfect example of ""How not to do action scenes"" by making each character regardless of faction break out into a speech/monologue. This trope is seen in multiple works of anime however it takes it a bit further by having upwards of up to 20 to 30 characters on screen to completely halt their actions with what I call the \'bystander syndrome\' until they\'re done speaking after almost every strike regardless of the context that put them in that situation. This leads to drawn out battles that are meant to be engaging and full of action feel like it\'s being played out for way too long especially given the fact there\'s only 12 episodes so time is important for these types of scenes. Given the fact that they try to deliver character development in these same scenes end up coming out to you not caring as a character feels the need to talk about their entire life story to the opposition being taking action again.It\'s an extremely jarring decision to make such an incomplete method of character growth and discussion so surely the characters are at least unique, right?The characters - These types of characters are generic and hit every single trope that you can possibly imagine. Side Characters that are given backstory only serve as a means to further the main characters story but then killed off in the same episodes. It presents you with a lack of emotion, ironically enough (with the joke being the show is meant to invoke actions vs emotions).Regardless, the main character holds a significant spot in my heart as being the most whiney and pointless kid in any anime I\'ve seen. People mock Shinji from Evangelion for being a \'coward\' for not getting in the robot, however the protagonist here will make you think Shinji is the most confident and upholding figure for everyone.This COULD be attributed to the idea that the protagonist is meant to be an \'observer\' of the events that unfold, however that role should specifically be made for the narrator/side characters, not necessarily the main character that has to take action and change the course of the plot. An accurate description of watching the main character would be akin to watching a show/anime of a person in a room sitting at a chair watching an anime with the person on the chair chiming in some times to his thoughts of what\'s going on infront of him.Needless to say, the main characters aren\'t that exciting or captivating to even be memorable to you, you\'ll never hear people that have watched at minimum 5 anime shows say ""X from children of the whales is a great character!"" It won\'t.Plot- This is just so dumbfoundly shocking that the plot of the show with such an interesting concept is more or less trash to put it lightly. Moments and things that happen are so telegraphed to the viewer it\'s almost insulting to you if you\'re paying attention even somewhat. Nothing is shocking and nothing is there to keep you invested or interested since the characters are as tasteful as cardboard. The dynamics of the characters are non-existent especially given the concept of showing emotions is forbidden (Even though the anime constantly breaks that rule MULTIPLE times for both heroes and villains) so the characters shown aren\'t really worth taking the time to care for them.|-Conclusion-|It\'s almost painful to watch this anime solely on the fact that it has a unique setting and concept being squandered by a staff that forgot how to write action dialogue, plot, and characters. It\'s downright insulting to ask viewers to invest 12 episodes of their time to witness a train wreck of bad handling that only those that haven\'t watched a single anime will enjoy it.I regret watching this/wasting my time to go through it trying to find anything redeemable for it to hold it at an average, that maybe I was too harsh and it\'ll turn out great, but it is without the doubt below average at best and a 1 out of 10 if you hate the visuals. anime presents the perfect example of ""How not to do action scenes"" by making each character regardless of faction break out into a speech/monologue.

If the above doesn\'t sound interesting, you can watch it for the artwork at least.', 'INTRODUCTION:Kujira no Kora is set on a fictional world, where people live on top of a floating island, or the ""Mud Whale"", as they call it. However, the island sails not on a sea of water, but on a sea of sand - akin to Final Fantasy XII\'s Nam-Yensa and Ogir-Yensa Sandseas. The inhabitants know nothing about the fate of mainland humans, so they sail alone, in a neverending journey with no destination.The anime also features magic: the vast majority of people living there are ""marked"", which can be used for a plethora of things - aim assist, defence, moving objects and so on. People...are either born with or without it, the latter being known as ""unmarked"". For an unknown reason, marked ones have a shorter lifespan - they can\'t live much past 30. Due to that, administration is left to those who can acquire more life experience and knowledge.As an adaptation from the homonymous manga, Kujira no Kora is a dramatic shoujo within an amazing and unique setting. The question remains: can it live up to its expectation?PLOT:One of these days, another island is found afloat - as a somewhat uncommon recurrence, it is a mean to gather resources for survival. Main character Chakuro finds there an enigmatic and dangerous girl, Lykos, and brings her home with him. At first, it feels like Kujira no Kora is a light-hearted exploration and adaptation anime. However, later events completely change the anime\'s tone: tragedy befalls upon the whole island. What follows from there is a dramatic, interesting sequence of events. Unfortunately, the plot suffers from both bad pacing, mostly from weirdly-timed climaxes, and bad narrative, which comes from overdramatic focus on specific events. The anime tries too hard to surprise us with misfortune and pain, and it fails miserably. Still, it is a show about survival - after the storm, life goes on, and the show portrays that in a fine manner.Besides Chakuro and Lykos, Ouni is the third main character. Despite them being the main trio, they aren\'t well developed as the anime goes on - which is a problem with the entire cast. All characters, and I mean ALL, are simply... boring. I could not care at all about Ouni\'s desires, Chakuro\'s inner battles nor Lykos\' struggle. Besides them, Suou is the most important ally and the one who gets frequent screen time, and Liontari is what is portrayed as a maniac enemy, a character I utterly despise. Shuan, Sami, Nibi, Neri, Ginshu, the Elders and all the others feel like filler characters, existing just for rushed plot points. I wish this were a 24 episode anime, so each of them could have been explored and developed.I\'m split in two regarding the art direction - effects and backgrounds are incredibly beautiful, being what looks like hand-drawn. Despite that, I hate most of characters\' look, as I feel they don\'t fit the atmosphere. I wish they weren\'t so ""anime-y"" just so they could match the environment around them. The sound direction is mesmerizing, it being Kujira no Kora\'s strongest part. Beautiful piano melodies fit melancholic scenes perfectly, while cheerful songs made us feel on-par with the happy moments around the island.There are also a few more things to note. Some deus-ex machina bullshit happens with certain characters, which should have been avoided. The inhabitants of the island are densely stupid regarding fighting strategy, though there is an implicit excuse to that. Most of the misteries are explained, though some are either badly shown or left out for a sequel, which is a cue to another point: the show features an open end, which may or may not satisfy viewers. I didn\'t mind it, though some might.CONCLUSION:Kujira no Kora is a wasted potential. I wanted it to be great, though it was just a fine anime. It did not live up to my expectations. It left the same sour taste in my mouth as Lost Song did, which is not a good thing.The worldbuilding is simply amazing, featuring both solid art and sound directions. The story itself is fine, though it could have been way better if it had fewer of the aforementioned problems. The characters are definitely the weakest link - too much time was wasted on drama I simply couldn\'t care about.

I cried quite a lot throughout this series, maybe due to pms or something like that, I'm joking by the way, but it made my heart ache with sorrow, grief but also love.It's a story telling us to never let go of our emotions, as...it is what makes us special, unique.

Is it acceptable to defend yourself with violence, how many will die, WHO will die, will it be a friend, a brother, sister, father or...mother.

Good.The world FOR NOW is plain, like REAAAAALY plain! Seriously though, it\'s a giant sand ocean, there\'s nothing much to talk about it, you can wonder about the beauties of the continents but i haven\'t read the manga so i can\'t expect much for now.The OST is amazing, if you haven\'t already watched the anime , just listen to the OST when they release it, it\'s absolutely outstanding, Made in Abyss levels of outstanding.Sound effects are really well blend with the environment and the Thymia sound effects are well portrayed with it\'s highlighted sound being easily recognized when someone is activating their thymia (also something noticeable in the anime).The Art Designs are..... Well i don\'t know how to describe it very well. It\'s ""Unique"", some may look at it and call it ""classic"" like designs made almost 4 to 5 years ago, but when you see it in action you can really see why the directors liked the style, with a colorful palette and smooth animation sequences, the art style of this anime makes it a real masterpiece when it is combined with it\'s amazing OST.Overall, i think everybody should at least give this anime a try, i\'m really enjoying the plot, and like some of the haters of SAO 2, i can become a critic of everything, but in this case, it\'s kind of hard to see the bad parts of this anime, it\'s just really well made in general.I just think it\'s kind of a shame it has only gained a 12 episode season (but shokugeki no souma san no sara got  24 episodes this year, I SEE YOU J.C STUDIOS), i feel like 12 episodes aren\'t enough to see the full picture yet and maybe i\'ll read the manga like i\'m doing with made in abyss. mystery part of the anime, in which in my opinion would be the main reason to watch this.Characters are generic, nothing new everyone! almost 2 decades of anime and now people are complaining about this common issue, look around you, everyone is generic and there are some people that are more interesting than others, either because they are really smart or maybe they are just energetic and everybody likes them, and this kind of character design in my opinion should be the basis of most anime, you don\'t need to have an impressive cast of 90 characters with their own background and special abilities or some other different thing (looking at you Naruto+), and this is portrayed very well in the development of this story.The people of the mud whale have no idea of what is going on in the world and neither does the main characters, the main characters are interesting because they are the ones looking at the major picture of the situation and trying to do something about it (or maybe write about it, in Chakuro\'s case), the side characters follow the chieftain\'s orders because they believe in him, and so do the main characters, they grew peacefully and depending on the guidance of the chieftain and the elders, so you shouldn\'t be asking ""why aren\'t they questioning the elders, blah blah"", they are but, they spent almost a decade without conflict and reaching to the elders and the chieftain would be common sense if you lived there, do you get my point?

The track for the PV was also enough to get me on the edge of my seat, searching all areas on the internet for a release date. Alas, it was one of those that wasn't as great as I had hoped it would be. That being said, some aspects were just so beautiful to me that I urged myself to write a review. Here are my thoughts-- SPOILER FREE.STORY - 5/10A very unique storyline-- one I cannot compare to any other anime (mind you I can't say I've watched...over 100). However, there were some episodes were I started feeling a little bit bored with the exposition. Things were becoming predictable, and I felt little to no tension built. If you you're looking for action-packed with suspense after every episode, this wouldn't be what your looking for.ART - 9/10.Breath-taking is the only word to describe it. I've never seen anything like it. I rewatched scenes after nearly every episode because the visuals were so stunning. The colour palette was quite beautiful too. Not much else to say, but I really loved the visuals of this show.SOUND - 9/10BEAUTIFUL soundtrack. The vocals were so elegant, matching the visuals in every scene. I will say that in some scenes I felt that the track was not fitting for the feeling that was to be portrayed in specific scenes. But I'll definitely be listening to this over and over again for a pick-me-up.CHARACTERS - 5/10.Didn't feel as thought many had unique traits about them. The main girl, Lykos, was a very boring character for me and I didn't enjoy her at all. One of the characters I didn't think was so bad was Ouni, who has a rather emotionless demeanour which I'm not a big fan of, either. My favourite character would, unfortunately, be one of the last to be introduced in the final two episodes of the season. I didn't grow any emotional attachment to a character in particular, which is always something I hope to gain from an anime. Bit of a swing-and-a-miss in this category, I must say.ENJOYMENT - 6/10.I had a hiatus with this anime after the 7th episode, to which I finished today after 41 days of time going by. I felt like it was becoming an effort to watch, and the only thing keeping me watching was the visuals and the music (I am a very creative person, so music and art are things I thrive on).TO CONCLUDE: Don't have high hopes for this one. But if you're like me and are fans of pleasing visuals and soundtracks, give it a go and see if you like it. over 100).

Watching the first episode or two, I had a lot of good will towards it.  The art is amazing, and reminded me very strongly of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (an all-time favorite of mine).  The music and voice acting were spot on.  And the ideas were FASCINATING.  I love approaching these high, philosophical ideas in fantasy, and questions of utopia or dystopia, and what makes a human, well, human or what makes life worth living.  And the initial story...and conflict we\'re given is just that, playing on what it means to have emotions and how life could be different for factions that sacrifice feelings over ones that don\'t.  It\'s not fare I\'d go for all the time, necessarily, but it can be really good stuff.All these existential questions and more were unceremoniously discarded or thrown into the ""never really addressed"" pile in favor of harsh action.  Also and more damningly discarded are basics like pacing and character development, the poor handling of which constantly degraded the show, along with a poor understanding of when and how to do its world building.As an example, we lose a very likable character early enough in the show that I wouldn\'t even count the death in question a spoiler.  I wouldn\'t mind so much, but towards the end of the show I realized that the one who died in the first couple of episodes was one of the straight-out best characters.  That\'s right, a character with only a little screen time in the first couple episodes beats out our leads in my mind because that bit character at least had a definitive persona and some recognizable character traits while our central characters just don\'t.  The survivors, most notably our leads Chakuro and Lykos, were damnably two-dimensional, with no character traits that you could discern if you weren\'t told by other characters that they\'re supposed to have those traits.  Chakuro can almost be forgiven -- he is our point of view character, and such a person suffering from being an invisible bland nobody is still bad, but it\'s hardly remarkable.  Lykos though has to do some heavy plot lifting, and we\'re supposed to believe that she\'s experiencing a journey as she gains feelings for, if not literally the first time, the first meaningful time.  How much does she change from the very beginning to episode 12?  Well, her voice acting does emote a little more, and she gets a crying scene?  Yay?  But that happened at the start of her journey too; there\'s no progress nor transformation, and if she has more or less become a person by the end of the show thanks to gaining feelings of her own, I have no idea who she is as a person.  None whatsoever!  There are more tolerable characters -- Ouni and Suou -- who experience arcs, but for the most part they aren\'t the focus as much as they should be through the bulk of the show if they\'re the characters we\'re supposed to be seeing evolve.The pacing throughout the story has a continual problem where too much time was spent on scenes that really didn\'t need it, or building in directions that never paid off.  For instance, there\'s a minor villain who never really amounts to anything who is given a really notable setup and what looks to be a huge, focal sendoff and it\'s totally undeserved.  Similarly, multiple times throughout the show we\'re treated to out-of-time conversations in some spirit world, and while the first one seems to be serving to build character (it fails) and comes at a time where it feels relevant and germane, at least one later such conversation comes in the middle of climactic action, and it takes FOREVER, repeating itself and slowly, over iterations, saying what it wants to say when a much shorter version of the same scene could have been just as effective.  Or, thanks to reducing the bloat, more effective.  These kinds of problems are throughout the show, to the point where you could probably tell the story that it wants to tell in episodes 1-9 in 6 or fewer, which would have left time for the simultaneously rushed and bloated post-script that takes up episodes 10, 11, and 12.  Speaking of which, that little misstep is truly baffling in its failure.  It has the emotional weight and sequence of occurences of something you could handle in a single episode, but introduces so many specific details and new plot threads that it feels like it needs another season to properly explain and explore them.  Maybe that\'s supposed to be the way it feels, since the show will outright tell you that the journey continues, but there are far more graceful ways to do it.  Other shows, adapted from longer-running source material, leave hooks to draw the audience on to a (theoretical) next season, but they don\'t do it at the expense of getting the first season right.The art and sound may be great, but the Story is a wasteful mess, the characters are bland puppets, and I was left feeling fundamentally unfulfilled by how insultingly little the show gave me.  Now, I will say this -- I do appreciate the world-building.  I love fantasy worlds that dare to be something alien to Earth as we know it, and the vast Sea of Sand that we see here does that well.  What\'s more, the creatures and powers (Both supernatural and political) that inhabit the world are quite interesting, and their roles and life-cycles seem designed well.  I didn\'t like Children of the Whales and can\'t recommend it, but at the same time I have to say that if a second season does manifest, I\'d probably at least try to watch it in the hopes that they go somewhere with that.Story: 3Art: 9Sound: 8Character: 3Enjoyment: 4Overall: 5 and conflict we\'re given is just that, playing on what it means to have emotions and how life could be different for factions that sacrifice feelings over ones that don\'t.

The story tackles difficult themes (e.g. value of life, emotional baggage) but is rushing the first episodes. Plus for the music. Establishment of the (fantasy) setting feels forced on many spots, could have been made a lot better by simply SHOWING what happens instead of narrating every little bit WITH THE CHARACTERS like the viewer is a total idiot and doesn't understand anything by watching. If you are a lazy storyteller, the budget doesn't allow it or sth. and you NEED to explain things, use text or off-voice. Characters who've lived in the...same spot for their whole lives don't go around telling each other how THEIR world works - there are so many ways to show all of that visually.

I must say, the story had potential. Even though the world was interesting, it is clearly undevelopped but that can be excused by the fact that it only has 12 episode to develop it and that the show seems to be focused on characters and emotions before world-building - but I\'ll come back on that part in the character section.Art...: 6. Unlike most people here, I really didn\'t find the art to be that amazing. Sure, it had some great character designs, great color palette and designs too, but that\'s about it. The art is good for something like an illustration, but in an anime, it\'s the animation that\'s more important, and that\'s what they\'re missing. Most of it was pretty stiff, and even on parts were it was supposed to be the climax, I feel like they just didn\'t put enough effort and, as people call it, enough sakuga.Sound : 8. Honestly I\'d be lying if I said that I paid big attention to the music in this anime apart from the opening. But I\'d say that it\'s a good point since it didn\'t disturb me from the actual show.Character : 3. Oh boy, the characters... Where do I start. Well, let\'s begin with the main character. To me he was one of the only good characters, along with Ouni and, to some extent, Lykos. But still, he was kinda...bland. Now, for other characters of the Mud Whale, while some had great potential (shoutout to best girl Ginshu and best girl #2 Taisha) they get forgotten pretty easily because of the lack of appearance (and yes I had to go back check their name since I forgot them because of how few these two appear in the show). Ouni and Nibi relationship was great, but it was only clearly revealed late in the show so it kinda ruined the climax of their relationship.About the characters from the other islands, I don\'t even want to talk about them because either 1) they have little to no screentime and 2) those we are able to see are simply incoherent. I mean, yeah, let\'s make an entire country full of """"""emotionless"""""" people and yet they will still have the exact same reaction as the inhabitants of the Mud Whale, pretty logical huh. Although I\'ll make an exception for Liontari since he is one of the few character of this anime who actually got character development.Enjoyment : 3. Boy was I bored when I watched this show. To be honest I only finished watching it to see where it was going in the end,  but I was rather disappointed with an ending leading to a most-likely second season. Well, at least I know that if that second season does actually come out, I probably won\'t watch it. : 6. Unlike most people here, I really didn\'t find the art to be that amazing.

I liked how it was shrouded in mystery, leaving me confused at some moments as to what exactly was going on before my eyes. I do admit that at some moments it left me a little too confused, hence why I'm rating this show a 7/10 for story, but luckily it wasn't too long for me to lose interest in it's concept. It was a very unique idea that had me hooked...on the concept from the beginning.Art 9/10:I really loved the art style in this anime. It wasn't the most beautiful I'd seen by any means, but it was definitely an anime that had visuals I really enjoyed. There were some especially beautiful shots in the anime that I will recall and remember fondly and I think that speaks volumes.Sound 6/10:I can't say that the sound was particularly overwhelming for me, but it wasn't necessarily bad either. The ed track was very nice, I wasn't that interested in the op, and the music in the actual show wasn't too memorable for me.Character 7/10:I must say that I did like a lot of the characters in this show. Lykos, Ouni, Chakuro, were probably the ones that kept my attention the most. That said, even with characters I did like, I can't say that all of them were memorable. The ones that caught my attention my most are memorable to me of course, but others characters? I can't say the same. I don't think they were necessarily bad characters, but they weren't so special that I would remember them and how they stuck with me.Enjoyment 8/10:Regardless of everything I've said so far, I really did enjoy the anime enough to give it a solid 8. I binged the show from episode 3 to 12 in one sitting if that says anything at all. I wanted to know more about the story as it progressed and I can say without a doubt that knowing more is coming makes me excited for what the future holds with this story. I'm hoping for the best, as well as to learn more about characters (new and old) along the way and what's to come for the characters as they enter the new world.Overall 8/10:I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who may have the slightest interest in it. I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of low rating reviews I've seen for this anime so far. I think it's a little harsh to give the rating anything lower than a 7 as an overall rating, simply because it doesn't deserve it. That said, the anime is not for everyone, as is every show. I think it's definitely worth a try, but if it does nothing for you, then that's okay. But give it a chance? I think you may find it'll be worth your while. on the concept from the beginning.Art 9/10:I really loved the art style in this anime.

I wanted to know more about the story as it progressed and I can say without a doubt that knowing more is coming makes me excited for what the future holds with this story. I'm hoping for the best, as well as to learn more about characters (new and old) along the way and what's to come for the characters as they enter the new world.Overall 8/10:I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who may have the slightest interest in it. I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of low rating reviews I've seen for this anime so far. I think it's a little harsh to give the rating anything lower than a 7 as an overall rating, simply because it doesn't deserve it. That said, the anime is not for everyone, as is every show. I think it's definitely worth a try, but if it does nothing for you, then that's okay. But give it a chance? I think you may find it'll be worth your while."", ""I Don't usually Write Reviews But Damn This anime is underrated.I MAKES MY BRAIN/HEART HURT.(I Had To Right This Big Review OR Else System Won't Accept It So Plz Pardon My English)JUST GIVE IT A TRY AND I PROMISE YOU WON'T REGRET IT.It's a small but Impactful Anime.It Doesn't Have A Big Story But It's aAbsolutely Watchable.I Have Already Watched All The Top Notch Animes Of This Decade and This Is Right Up There.🙏🙏...Give It A Try.Opening And Ending Are OPStory: 8Has I Said It's Not Big On Story (Atleast in season 1) But The Plot isEngaging and Keeps You In suspense .If You like Cute Kids And People Learning From Hardship Them You Will Enjoy It.(It's Unique).Art : 9For Me The Art Style Is Excellent And Top Notch.

The visual style is without a doubt the greatest strength that the show possesses, and probably what influenced most of the viewers to watch it in the first place.Sound 7/10The soundtrack is definitely good, but not something that really stands out as remarkable when I think about the show. I do not...think back on any of the music in the show and think to myself, ""Wow, that was truly remarkable, I\'d like to listen to that again.""Story 2/10The story had some potential to begin with because of the interesting setting, but suffers tremendously by trying to cram way too much into a short time. Because of this, it relies on more cliches than I can count. The plot just seems predictable most of the time, and completely jumbled the next. The most egregious offender of predictability lies with the character deaths. You can predict with painful accuracy who will die and when because the story just regurgitates popular tropes. Some previously unintroduced character shows some kind of unique personality quirk? Yup, looks like he\'s dying in the next episode. Another character has a flashback scene that is trying to establish that he means something to the main characters? Yup, looks like he\'s going to die too. At one point, they bestow magical McGuffin powers onto a character in the most cliche way possible. The possibility of this character having McGuffin powers is mentioned by an antagonist, so the antagonist (who actually believes in the existence of these McGuffin powers) decides to just continually hit this character with non-fatal blows for no reason other than to give the McGuffin powers the chance to manifest. The thought process for this character must have played out as ""Oh no, this guy may be the magical McGuffin that can ruin all of our plans! Better whack him a few more times before ending him hurr durr."" Scenes like this were physically painful to watch. It\'s as if an alien watched a few episodes of anime and then tried to regurgitate the tropes he had seen onto a very pretty canvas. The actions are there to move the story along, but they do not seem like choices made by actual people.Characters 1/10The characters were by far the worst aspect of this show. Without going into very much detail, you have your 5 flavors of stereotypical mediocrity. You have your protagonist who is sensitive and unnaturally gifted with magic but unsure and doubtful of himself, your silent mysterious badass with a heart of gold, your sensitive ultra-pacifist, your sadist antagonist (why? BECAUSE REASONS), and your unique looking female who has no emotions (see Rei-clone).  Their motivations for doing virtually anything that they do make very little sense, and it feels like there is barely any semblance of a character arc for any of them. Their actions just don\'t seem to be the actions of actual human beings with actual motivations, and for that reason, I just could not develop any feelings of attachment to any of them. *Finished after this point, and the character problems do in fact get worse*I think the best way to summarize the shortcomings of this show is that it tries to accomplish and incorporate a lot of elements without earning the right to do so. It doesn\'t invest enough time into its characters to make you care about them, so it does not earn the right to make you feel for their deaths or struggles. It doesn\'t construct an interesting plot, so it does not elicit surprise or awe at any of the twists it tries to incorporate. It tries to speak about deep themes with grand, sweeping statements about life, the world, etc, but it just hasn\'t created a well-crafted story by which to illustrate its points.tl;dr the show is absolutely beautiful, but there is no substance beneath the aesthetically appealing veneer.

However, sound (7/10, especially opening and ending songs) and art (8/10) are really good.Like most things at first sometimes they seem a bit dull so I thought I'd give it a chance till the end and I am glad I did. The story line gets more and more interesting to the point where I wanted to read the manga to know what's gonna happen next. Introduction of new characters and showing flashbacks of...the character's background also got me hung up, wanting to find out more about what they were like and how they came to be what they are now. The unfolding of the mysteries introduced at the beginning and how things get riled up towards the end (how their might be conflict between marked and unmarked) also makes it all the more engaging.You have to keep an open mind while watching, giving the anime a chance till after episode 5-6 and you will find its worth your time. I like that the season is short (12 episdoes) so it doesn't drag on too long. It's not very action based since it's a shoujo of course so emotions are a big part of the anime. It might not be the best anime to watch but it's one of the good ones. I hope they make season 2 cause I'd really like to know how the story unfolds. the character's background also got me hung up, wanting to find out more about what they were like and how they came to be what they are now.

I wished I had seen it sooner because this was a pleasant surprise. The world building is top tier and the clash between the main characters' civilization and their oppressive villains is incredibly engaging.This show is similar to other shows and movies where you have a civilization that knows nothing of the outside world and then are brutally brought down to earth and forced to not only acknowledge the outside world but also combat those who wish to harm them. However, the execution of this story is striking and original; I was never thinking of a similar show...during the entire runtime.Right out of the gate, the civilization is pushed to their emotional limits after experiencing tragedy. Seeing them take a stand was so powerful and emotionally satisfying. The action did not shy away from the psychological brutality of the violence and sense of loss. The civilization acts with their hearts on their sleeve which in turn makes the audience emotionally invested in the characters. No main character stands out, rather the combined social structure of the civilization is what draws the audience's investment.  At the same time, there is a long mystery associated with their civilization and their past that comes into play as the story plays out which adds an extra layer of interest.The animation is unique with backgrounds that look like water colored still images. The facial expressions and outline of the characters is intricate to make them stand out in the crowds of their civilization. The buildings, environment, and magic effects are gorgeous to look at.Unfortunately, it looks like Netflix did not continue the show. Its a shame since there is 5x more material afterwords in the manga. If you did like this show, I highly recommend continuing with the manga.

It has a cutesy exterior, but on the inside, it's a sad story. At least, initially.It feels like a casual story as compared to a deep and intricate story. If you're looking for something interesting to kick back and enjoy (based on the synopsis), then I'd say you'd like this, but if you're looking for depth or for everything to make sense, then maybe skip it. It's a story about kids with powers dying young and trying to change their destiny...one way or another. I wasn't expecting much, I actually watched it without reading anything about it, but I got a nice ride out of it.Either way, I highly recommend watching it yourself to see if it interest you.You can really tell the creator intended for this to be a longer story instead of a seasonal anime. It's not a masterpiece, but I enjoyed watching it and it kept my interest.I can't give it anything higher than a 7.5 though.

Everything about it was gorgeous. The art, the music, the production, the world. They could have made this an adventure and story about love, honor, and sacrifice. Instead the characters are all depressing and mopey. When the main character's love interest dies, he's seemingly ok a few scenes later and he's actually smiling. It's like this story was written by a buddhist monk. There's barely any reaction. Anger should have been the most obvious reaction, but instead the main character writes words on walls and...flirts with other girls after his childhood love interest literally just got killed in the same episode. I'm genuinely frustrated by the lack of any reaction to the death of characters. Instead of being angry, the elders just decide they should just all kill themselves and save the bad guy the trouble. ARE YOU FREAKIN REAL? This had so much potential, but I was actually angry that they wasted so much production value on such a garbage set of characters. flirts with other girls after his childhood love interest literally just got killed in the same episode.

I mean there is some heavy stuff that happens early on with a character death that we're SUPPOSED to care about *eye roll.* It's like nachos but there's only one tortilla chip submerged in a sea of cheese.The story finally picks up around episode 7, but who really wants to wait that long? Not me usually...To be honest, for a story centered around emotions it took too many episodes for me to feel anything.On top of that, the slice-of-life element leaves a serious mood whiplash....SN: WHY IN THE WORLD DO WE NEED AMPLE FOOTAGE OF A DUMB DANCE!?! She looked so stupid. (this will make sense to those that have watched it).CHARACTERS:The characters are really flat, and I couldn't stand Chakuro, the main character. He just seemed too cookie-cutter like many other anime male leads.Ouni was my favorite though you could argue that he's a cardboard cut-out of an anti-hero. Still, I would've liked this show much better with him as the MC.Lykos was boring. I've seen this character too many times. Nothing about her stands out.ART/ANIMATION:It was good. I think the style made some characters look a bit cutesy, but I liked it overall.SOUND: (English Dub)Music is forgettable.Voice-acting was meh/average. I feel like some voices fit the characters well but they had no passion for dramatic scenes or they were too weak like Suou's.OVERALL:If you don't mind waiting a LONG TIME to pick up interest in a story, then you should try watching it. It was a real struggle for me to get past ep 2., but it's not the worst show. I thought Ouni was the gem of the show.Still, I will watch a season 2.

A strong start to something, but as its own product it definitely falls short.I was drawn to the show due to its high quality art, interesting sounding setting, and what I thought was a really strong first episode that pulled me immediately. I basically binged it all in one sitting, which is already some pretty high praise. It was not a struggle to get through at all and I enjoyed my time with it.This show relies on unreliable narrators, societal taboos, cultural traditions, and...things like that to do its world building. You\'ll have to pay attention to understand and grasp what\'s happening. If you don\'t have the attention span for that, this isn\'t the show for you. Frankly, I think you\'ll know early on if it is or isn\'t - I was hooked right away, and trying to unravel these mysteries about their culture and why things are the way they are and why certain people can act in certain ways we\'re told to assume they can\'t is a huge part of why I enjoyed it as much as I did. Judging from other reviews that complain about perceived inconsistencies or lack of explanations, despite the show lacking any inconsistencies or explanations for things that aren\'t intentionally mysteries, this is not the show for everyone.Personally, my biggest complaint is that I didn\'t at any point emotionally connect with a show that felt like it was really, really trying to get me to. There\'s lots of moments where I thought ""oh that\'s sad,"" but none of them moved me. Part of that is a pretty average soundtrack, outside of its pretty fantastic OP, ED and an insert song we hear a couple times, which simply fails to elicit any real emotional response from me. But the bigger problem probably is with the characters.They\'re mainly fine, or a recipe for something interesting, but the show is far more interested in giving us worldbuilding and lore than in connecting us to the characters. I actually think Chakuro is fine, as is Lykos, as is Oruka. They are perfectly fine in their roles and aren\'t a problem, but none of them are particularly inspiring. I actively like Ouni, Ginshu, Suou, and Neri, but we\'re not given much of any of them. Otherwise... they\'re either too wrapped up in the idea of being a mystery, or aren\'t given enough time or weight to actually feel something when tragedy strikes other characters. It\'s just, again, ""oh that\'s sad,"" not even remotely coming close to making me cry and I\'m a girl who will cry at anything. Or, they\'re Ryodari, and are completely insufferable and a huge detracting element from the show.Part of the problem with Ryodari is the voice acting performance is just too over the top for him. Had he been played in a more sinister, reserved way, endless anger bubbling just below the surface, he could have been actually terrifying and interesting. Instead, he\'s just this over the top cartoon caricature that is just so bad. Chakuro\'s voice actor gets a little over the top a couple times too, as do a few other characters at other moments. Oh, and Ham, the cute little animal, sounds too much just like a person making cute animal sounds and that\'s awfully distracting. Otherwise the voice acting and sound are solid enough, but that\'s not a small amount of issues.The overall plot is really interesting, it has Lovecraftian elements to it and the worldbuilding is frankly fascinating. If you\'re at all into that, it\'s worth the small time commitment to check it out, I think. It has pretty fantastic art, though sometimes the background and animated elements don\'t blend together super well. The magic is super cool looking, gives off some Scrapped Princess vibes in terms of interesting magic effects, and the fights we do see are pretty cool usually. It has most of all the elements here to make a really, really great show.In the hands of someone more focused on getting us to know the characters maybe this season alone could even have been fantastic on its own. But instead, it just sets us up for a really exciting adventure to come that, well, might not ever get here. In that case it plays out like so many other shows based on interesting fantasy manga - just an advertisement for the manga. And that\'s a shame, because this definitely feels like a decent first season to a fantastic series, not the mediocre start that doesn\'t deserve any further episodes that others seem to make it out to be.If I could give it a 7.5, I would. I\'d round up to an 8 to help balance out the reviews this show is getting, because I really think it deserves attention, but I\'m pretty harsh in my ratings and don\'t want to make an exception for this. things like that to do its world building.

I've read a volume or two of the manga beforehand, nothing so much as to spoil the bulk of the story but enough to get me excited about seeing it on Netflix. As much as I wanted to enjoy this anime all the way through, watching this show quickly became tedious.Story: 3In the beginning, this story looked promising. From the get-go, the worldbuilding quickly got my attention and I enjoyed the unique ideas presented. I could see that there was potentially a lot going on...in the background that could potentially be the focus for later episodes, particularly the elder council and the surrounding world. However, how it went about this was most assuredly backwards.Take, for example, and there will be spoilers here, the first episode really going indepth into the elder council. Here we see the reaction to the attack on the island from the elders. Instead of taking a moment to think rationally, coming up with a strategy to repel the invaders or at least escape another attack, the elders decide on the ingenious plan to... wait for it... kill everyone. Brilliant. Then they expect no one to argue and they don't even consult the villagers to ask, hey, would you guys be cool with dying so we can atone for our sins or whatever? And that was the justification they used. Their ancestors from a century ago, apparently criminals, were driven out because they had emotions. So obviously the entire island had to go belly up because of that.Yeah, well, in case you didn't pick up on it, that plan backfired a bit. Or not. Not like the elders should have any repercussions for knowingly deciding to murder the entire island and kidnapping the one person in power who didn't agree with them. But this highlights one very big issue in the series that bothered me the entire way through. The elder council is clearly a flawed system, the elders in question untouchable by law and placed in a position of power merely because they managed to live long enough. It wasn't as if it was hard to live long - all you had to do was be born without the power of thymia. So any moron could become one of the almighty rulers so long as they didn't take a flying leap off into the sand ocean. Not only this, but there's a clear unbalance in power between the marked and the unmarked. So what if the marked have thymia? Thymia was basically just a means to fling things around prior to the attack, but Children of the Whales treats it, at times, as if it were second only to godhood. So not only do the marked live essentially under the thumb of the unmarked, they do all the hard labor. Yet they don't even question it. This, to me, was the hardest part to stomach in the whole series. When someone does try to rise up against the elder council, albeit on some definitely skewed thinking that makes absolutely no sense even for a child, it's immediately quenched. I guess that's because that isn't the focus of the story, even though the series is very clearly trying to take on the politics of this whole ordeal along with everything else. I have an entire world of things I could pick apart here, but this review shouldn't just be about the story and this is a bit of a long wall of text.Art: 7The art from the manga was, I'm sure, what drew a lot of readers to the title. It was also probably the entire reason the anime was worth salvaging. Though the art doesn't hold a candle to the manga, it carried over surprisingly well. The backgrounds were detailed and atmospheric. The anime looked good, all around. My main complaints come in with the character designs, which were hardly unique. While they were different enough to tell apart, the faces pretty much looked the same and the style of the characters could be jarring against the backgrounds, especially when CGI was used.Sound: 6The music composition suited the tone and atmosphere while not being particularly outstanding. Voice acting was decent, I'd say, though I'm not one to take note of that too much. Liontari's voice got on my nerves more than it should, and constantly distracted from the story, but maybe that was just the character itself. Nothing to write home about.Characters: 2These are the worst aspect of the story, never setting up too many expectations and yet dashing them all the same. The main character is a bland protagonist whose only two qualities are that he can't do anything and he likes living. Yippee. Oh, and he writes things obsessively, a character trait that started out as a plot device, stayed a plot device, and was dropped occasionly as the plot served. Most of the other characters, and there are many, fall into stereotypes or their only personality trait is that they have no personality.Speaking of no personality, there's also Neri and her twin sister who have absolutely no explanation for existing as of yet, have these weird god powers, speak to the dead, and deliver exposition whenever the mood strikes them. They are also prone to breaking into and encouraging others to sing and dance, usually about death and during the middle of a climactic moment. The only other character who exhibits this behaviour is Liontari, someone who gets off on killing emotional people and is later forced to perform in a jester suit for the sake of his boss Orca's weird fetish for the things. Huh.Enjoyment: 3The height of my enjoyment was during the first two episodes, when I still had the innocence of expecting an unfinished manga to be adapted well. It steadily decreased from there as the series just got worse and worse. By the time I was at the final episode, I was practically ready to just drop the series for the time being only to spontaneously pick it up again a year or two later. There's a part of me that still wishes I had done that.Man, this review ended up being long. in the background that could potentially be the focus for later episodes, particularly the elder council and the surrounding world. However, how it went about this was most assuredly backwards.Take, for example, and there will be spoilers here, the first episode really going indepth into the elder council. Here we see the reaction to the attack on the island from the elders. Instead of taking a moment to think rationally, coming up with a strategy to repel the invaders or at least escape another attack, the elders decide on the ingenious plan to... wait for it... kill everyone. Brilliant. Then they expect no one to argue and they don't even consult the villagers to ask, hey, would you guys be cool with dying so we can atone for our sins or whatever? And that was the justification they used. Their ancestors from a century ago, apparently criminals, were driven out because they had emotions. So obviously the entire island had to go belly up because of that.Yeah, well, in case you didn't pick up on it, that plan backfired a bit. Or not.

Frankly, an exquisite, elegant, and dystopian series from what the anime spotlight is currently on. Something that for me is very unusual but attractive. The mainstream often emphasizes action over expressionism. Not all animes are meant to satisfy all people, but if you like a dramatic and mind-scratching dramatic anime, with slow but detailed progress in the plot. This is the one.I fell in love with the characters back when I was sixteen (now 21), the same age as Ouni, the character that made a significant impact...on me. He has a big heart for his friends but usually keeps things to his own, due to his lack of expressiveness. I understand that a lot. And You don't have to feel this way to understand that he has a problem communicating all his goodwill. A lot of the meaning in this series is between the lines, and I recommend advancing the manga at the same rhythm as the anime. It will not let you down where the anime honestly did.I know mainstream viewers like to have all conflicts and problems perfectly explained, as a character development. But here you don't. You learn from what you are watching and that's the whole point of the story. Super kind and powerful people isolated on an Island who know little about the rest of the world, and when they know this is what happens...--- Spoiler Alert ---If you don't like this kind of plot don't watch it. But it may even make you realize this kind of alternative reality is somewhat something to be worried about. Now, it's difficult to find a child without a phone, but when I was a kid I liked to learn plenty of good things from my fathers. Just to get hit by the MASSIVE way of hatred around the world I live in. People should protect better environments, and try to be a better person for others, and, that's somewhat a resolution you can get from this anime.I'm tired of seeing parents not taking care of the development of a child and just letting them be distracted with phones when they haven't taught them yet, how to be a respected and good person. I'm also tired of people coming from a development like this, to be the pathetic influencers we see all over the internet. People don't give enough time to think about what good are they doing for the world, but-, if they find something they want such as money, or supremacy, they can destroy more than an Island.PD: No, you don't need to have trillions of plot twists nor an impressive character arc, to enjoy and understand what good transcription it is giving in particular. The story is simply dramatic, and people suffer. Friendships suffer, democratic rights suffer, and people get killed. This is not an out-of-the-way super fantastic fantasy.

Seeing something with so much potential to be so dreadful just pains me.ED sounds...pretty good tho pretty good tho"", 'Children of the WhalesI read the synopsis and was actually interested to see what this anime could offer to one. The first episode also gave me very slight Avatar-like vibes, from the presentation and atmosphere of the world. So far it was also still decently convincing despite slow entry.Long story short, in the end, this was an even more traumatic event than I could have ever imagined. And I ask myself again, why are there no quality controls before something like this even gets a budget for adaptation? There\'s no way there were serious people who thought this anime was a good idea.The...main problem here is that Children of the Whales is an anime/manga that has a relatively interesting basic idea. However, it doesn\'t expand on it at all and is further underwhelmed by all the other problems. Bad dialogue, terrible characters, melodrama, slow pacing, poor writing, and to make matters worse, this anime feels like it\'s based on an RPG. It\'s not, even though all the scenes and dialogue seem like they came from a cheap game adaptation.Although the first and last episodes have been almost average, everything in between has been a violation of my soul. The fighting, the ambitions, the dialogues, the scene-setting - everything was so amateurishly bad as if I were watching some Indian Hollywood remake.[Story 2]The story takes place on a moving island where the protagonists have lived for generations. Unaware of why and what is going on with the outside world. The explanation of the outside world is interesting later on, but the way it is presented is abysmally bad. You get the feeling several times that there was no real rationale for the confrontation between the island and the people of the outside world. The entire conflict felt almost like a children\'s fight, which nevertheless resulted in a bloodbath.The people of the island are of course the perfect good people, while the others are obvious shounen antagonists. Black-and-white splitting is clearly done here so that one of the two sides can\'t be taken seriously at all.[Characters 2]This is an incredibly tragic point. Rarely have I seen such monotonous, empty, lifeless, and meaningless characters as here. And this is really appalling, they have neither depth nor real personality. Ironic that their opponents are emotionless puppets, at least the two groups fit perfectly into the picture.The protagonist is an empty shell that has more monologues than he uses in the series, although everyone praises him for always reacting too late or doing nothing at all. He describes to you through his narrative skills all the events and what the viewers see anyway. He always mentions some data and statistics with a gloomy tone of voice, as if they had some relevance. And no, they don\'t. He\'s practically an extra.The female lead is also an empty shell, but luckily we at least had some fan service. Thought this kudere was going to disappoint.Sasuke Jäger 2.0 which strives for freedom is the purest catastrophic bundle of thought processes that he does not even comprehend himself. Everything he wants, he doesn\'t want and everything he wants, he wants. That\'s about how the character can be put into words. At least he broke all the kill records.All the other side characters had faces but nothing behind them. There was some crazy guy with an eye patch who just gave the audience goosebumps with his pubescent 12th-grade syndrome.And of course, the evil bad guys who are evil.
