Zombie-Loan Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3354/Zombie-Loan_Specials,"['*2 little notes:1. I\'ll not only write a review for this OVA, but for all Zombie-Loan episodes that have been aired so far, including the anime because this OVA continues where the last anime episode stops.2.  I\'ll not stick to the story/art/sound/character/enjoyment format but write down what I have on my mind and hope that people will find this review a bit helpful.~ I apologize in advance if I make some mistakes with spelling or grammar, \'cause I\'m not a native English speaker~Now after saying this, it\'s time to write down what I think. It\'s only my opinion and you don\'t have...to agree with it of course.I don\'t really remember how I got Zombie-Loan anime in my ""plan to watch"" list (yeah probably I put it there but don\'t remember how I found it lol) but after watching it, I\'m so glad that it was there. Zombie-Loan is a really great serie that every horror/mystery/comedy lover must see.After reading a few reviews about this anime, I can see that many people didn\'t like the fact that there were so little episodes. I didn\'t like that of course but I don\'t see why that should play a role in my rating. Someone also said that there are many holes in the plot, but don\'t forget that this anime is not finished (at least it doesn\'t look like finished) and it\'s full with things that will be discovered later.Zombie-Loan has a very original plot, at  least in my opinion and it has a great potential to become one of the most amazing stories in anime/manga world.If you are dead in this moment,  and there\'s someone by your side who says that you can continue to live but you must work for them to pay the loan, what would you do? In this story , there are many different characters who must learn to live and fight together because they share the same faith, they\'ll all die if they don\'t continue to fight. That leads us to Zombie-Loan\'s two male main characters, Chika Akatsuki and Shito Tachibana who hate each other but because of the play of destiny they can\'t fight and live without each other. One day, Michiru Kita, a girl from their school runs into them (or is it better to say steps on Chika\'s hand lol) while she\'s coming back from buying everyone\'s lunch. When they bring her the lunch she didn\'t collect, her friends tell her that those two are the only survivors from the accident that happened 6 months ago. Michiru has a secret, she is the owner of shinigami eyes and can see the ring around those people that are going to die in near future. The ring starts as gray  and when it\'s black that mean that the person will die very soon. She sees that those two have black rings around their necks. Michiru goes unconsciousness while in school and stays in nursing room until evening. When she tries to leave she sees Chika and Shito switching hands and freaks out. They want to kill her but suddenly they are attacked by something so they decide to take care of the monster first. After that they point their weapons at her and she discovers what she knows..or think she knows. She tells them that they both are going to die very soon. Instead of killing her those two decide that it\'s the best if she helps them with her eyes to find the zombie that hunts on school\'s territory. Michiru doesn\'t want to be a part of this, but after she finds out that her friend disappeared she joins them for a hunt in her school. While she\'s protecting her friend, she end\'s being badly hurt...when she wakes up..well that\'s where the real adventure begins so you must watch it by yourself ;) The characters are so different and they are all so funny so you can\'t do anything else but love them :D The soundtrack is nice. I love the opening and especially the ending theme. I also like the art...and wow there\'s also blood :DI really enjoyed this anime. It\'s sad that it\'s not finished and it really needs to have more episodes and seasons. The manga is still on-going so I hope that we\'ll see more of Zombie-Loan. OH GOD!! Please, please let them do more!! It\'s sad that lame series like Naruto, Pokemon etc. have so many episodes and something great like Zombie-Loan and Ghost Hunt ends unfinished..it\'s breaking my heart really. What happened with people that actually adore good stories and what happened with people that actually were making them -_-\'Overall, if you like anime with dark feeling, mysteries, blood, adventure and humor you\'ll love this one and you\'ll be sad when you\'ll finish the second episode of this OVA. If you like Ghost Hunt or D.Gray-Man (I can find huge similarities between these two and Zombie-Loan) you can try this one as well and be sure that you will not end up watching some lame show. Some people say that it\'s similar to Death Note, but no, it\'s not..the only thing these two have in common are the shinigami eyes and nothing more, which doesn\'t mean that if you like one of them you won\'t like the other one. I personally like them both ;)Hope you\'ll have fun as much as I did :) to agree with it of course.I don\'t really remember how I got Zombie-Loan anime in my ""plan to watch"" list (yeah probably I put it there but don\'t remember how I found it lol) but after watching it, I\'m so glad that it was there.

Sora wo Kakeru Shoujo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5307/Sora_wo_Kakeru_Shoujo,"['*A war between overly chatty AI.*I know I have been saying this a lot lately and I have come to believe this personally too. One must endure the ""hardship"" of anime to ripe its fruit. By this I mean the often boring, below-your-expectation type first few episodes of an anime series. One must remember that if the anime is 24 or so episodes long, taking 4 to 6 episodes to get the necessary background out of the way is reasonable. Dropping the show when it is not even a quarter done is very disrespectful to the series. So with all that said, what does it...have to do with Sora wo Kakeru Shoujo? First of all, everything I have said above applies to this show. It does not have catchy starting episodes and the story seemed to be going nowhere at first. In addition, there is a great big WTF episode shortly after the story seem to get going (seriously…that was the greatest WTF episode I have ever encounter from a series, but it was still entertaining). But all in all, the utterly absurd idea of space colonies actually having “hand-to-hand” combat is enough for anyone to give this a try, or at least watch the WTF filler episode (personal recommendation; no background is necessary though you will have to discover the exact episode yourself).The show is not built around pure absurdity; there is in fact a heavy metaphor in this show. The show depicts modern day teenagers (and young adults) as human trapped in “boxes” (literally). There is everything one will ever need in the box, thus allowing everyone to be comfortable just by staying inside. This is analogues to how an ever increasing portion of the younger population are now satisfied by simply sitting in front of their computer or gaming console all day without the urge of going outside or having “physical” interactions with friends. The show has a good message behind it, unfortunately it is a bit ironic that the more successful they become, the more people will be glued to the TV screen or monitor.The crew responsible for this series is the same people who did the Mai series a few years back (Mai HiME, Mai-Otome, the OVAs, etc). So it should come as no surprise that some story elements may sound familiar and that some characters may exhibit similar characteristics in terms of their personality traits. The story does indeed sound a bit generic with three girls saving mankind from destruction. However, given the setting is in a futuristic space environment with self-realizing AI controlling space colonies, many fun and amazing events can happen.Animation-wise, Sunrise is trying to give the viewers some clean new looks. While it may look awkward at first, the animation is quite easy to get used to, and the unique character looks and potato-shaped robots are pleasant to look at. The colonies design varies dramatically. Some look like a fearsome battle fortress, while others look like a fish with a long waggy tail. But other than these unusual looking characters and colonies, the production value is solid, and the animation quality is consistent throughout the series.In terms of the music in this series, let’s just say it is average. The first OP was bad, unless you are an ALI Project fan, I doubt you’ll enjoy it much. Noting too spectacular for the first ED either (a bit to kiddy if you ask me). Perhaps due to how poorly made the first OP and ED was, the second OP and ED seemed exceptionally well made. The difference between them can truly be described as night and day. Much to my surprise, some of the sound effects (especially during battles) are recycled from the Gundam SEED series. Putting the music aside, the seiyu in Sora wo Kakeru Shoujo is nothing but big names. Some of these talented seiyu include: Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch from Code Geass, Watanuki from xxxHOLIC), Ami Koshimizu (Horo from Spice and Wolf), Mai Nakahara (Nagisa from Clannad), Rie Tanaka (Lacus from Gundam SEED), Akira Ishida (Athrun from Gundam SEED), just to name a few.There are many occasions from Sora wo Kakeru Shoujo and its spin off manga series that will remind us of Code Geass, one of the most successful series that Sunrise recently produced. While the parallelism may not be obvious to some at first (beside the undeniable evil Lelouch/Leopard’s laugh), it was hilarious to see Leopard stated that if he is a human he would look like Lelouch. Check it out here. http://i527.photobucket.com/albums/cc354/KaminaKun/lelopard.jpg It is from the official manga, not a fanart, although there are plenty of cute looking GIF with a Lelouch/Leopard mix all over the net right now. have to do with Sora wo Kakeru Shoujo?

To be frank, Sora Kake is neither of them. Yet, it is quality. Quality indeed, but on a very different department.One crucial thing that you must understand is that in Sora Kake things just happen. You don’t ponder about it and much less question it. It just is. The Girl who leapt through space is a show filled with idiocy and ridiculous situations leading...to more ridiculous events ultimately leading to some conclusion. However, Sora Kake is a special case you see, because in here being that random it isn’t a bad thing after all.  You can say that it is one of those times that you may call a show stupid yet enjoyable.In Sora Kake we are presented with several anime references such a Code Geass, Gundam, Gainax to name a few. In addition, we can see anime cliché are all over the place for example: girl with superpowers, the chosen one, friends who later becomes foes, evil villain who wants to act as god, mentally disturbed teenagers, and even coming from the dead to list a few. Think back on those typical anime moments and slap them together into a typical mecha show in space featuring comedy, girls with tight suits, people with funky hair styles and deliberate use of English language which would make any non-Japanese feel uncomfortable. Mixed them all up add Jun Fukuyama and you get Sora Kake. That's exactly what Sora Kake is. But you know what? As weird as it may sound, it isn't such a bad thing.It should be clear that the major attraction of the show is a megalomaniac AI named Leopard (Lelouch). His innumerable rabid rants, rambling, delusions of grandeur and his epic Lelouch-like lines always makes the day. So don’t be misled by the title. The show is really about Leopard. He makes the show entirely, without him there is no Sora Kake.For obvious reasons Sora Kake is categorically a hit or miss. Simple as it sounds, you either like it or you don’t. The chances of you liking it will be slimmer if you aren’t a fan of randomness and close to zilch if you are unfamiliar with Code Geass which is a must before Sora Kake. If for some inexplicable reason you’re looking for something deep, amazing character development, and complex story in Sora Kake you aren’t watching this show correctly. You are looking in the wrong place and even the wrong planet or galaxy.  Thus I strongly recommend you stay far away from Sora Kake if you are unfamiliar with those titles because you just won’t’ be able to enjoy it at all.To be summarize, you’re watching Sora Kake for laughs, the randomness, fanservice and to see how far Sunrise can push it while keeping the show as amusing as they can. I believe that we should all deem Sora Kake Shoujo as a product built around absurdity and pure LULZ made only for that purpose. I, for one, enjoyed the ride. to more ridiculous events ultimately leading to some conclusion.

Don't get me wrong, it's not like the other characters are totally uninteresting, but his Lelouch-like rants and megalomania (even as an AI) single-handedly raise the score of this show by a full point.Don't watch this if you're looking for a lot of plot intricacy or subtlety, I found that the pacing can be a little ADD-mode sometimes. Then again that might be exactly what you're looking for.This series has been somewhat episodic so far, though there is obviously some buildup for a larger underlying plot. In the most recent episodes it...seems like we might be beginning to see the forming of something a little bigger. Despite being fairly light-hearted and silly so far, I'm inclined to think that things are going to get a little more serious eventually.In short, it's an entertaining show to watch, not exactly time for deep-thinking, and it's a great way to get a weekly dose of Lelouch. ;) seems like we might be beginning to see the forming of something a little bigger.

Truthfully, she and Luke from first part of Tale of Abyss can...make a good pair.I swear the only thing keep me from drop this series coz His Majesty Lelouch's reincarnation : LEOPARD !! This brain colony always make me laugh when i see him, While still can't escape from moron trend of series, he somehow able to retain some of his previous life's qualify; hearing him yelling would be a good laugh. But overall, even His Majesty can't save this entire series. make a good pair.I swear the only thing keep me from drop this series coz His Majesty Lelouch's reincarnation : LEOPARD !!

But overall, even His Majesty can't save this entire series."", ""Now keep in mind i'm reviewing this series, with it essentially only half watched, and this is a one of the few reviews i HAVE written. I will most likely be revising this a little as i will finish watching this...however i don't expect it to change much of anything as i the feeling i have really just makes me want to stop before it gets worse. So before you hit that not helpful button, take a moment, to stop, think and ask yourself these questions.Was there a story? Did they execute it well or not at all?How was the art? Better or worse...then anything i've seen before?How was the sound? Did i like the Voice Actors selected for this series?Were the opening and ending songs likable enough for me to search for the band itself? How was the music between each scene itself, did it work or was it over the top or simply was corny as all fuck?Did i truly enjoy this series, or did i just hop on the happy train and let them shove laughing gas down my throat?All legit questions you should ask before saying a review is helpful or not, or even if you actually liked a series.The story, is....simply isn't there. You jump from one point to another with no decisive or even reasonable conclusion from a previous incident. I looked over the first few episodes just to see if i wasn't actually paying attention, but it was as i thought the first time i watched them. It simply isn't there, you have your background, your setting, your characters, all in the right place at the right time, not doing the right thing...this is not supposed to happen normally no? But it does, and there is NO excuse, they had ample chances to recover by episode 10 yet; one filler and one half filler and you see some major mistakes.The art is actually surprisingly good, more so even if you've watched as many as i have, which all in all isn't really alot. It's superior to much of the artwork, backgrounds that i've seen. However it does have it's slip ups here and there, but that's to be expected in any show, nothing is perfect.OP, ED and everything inbetween, it's a listen to mem, but forget. Not memorable what-so-ever. The VA's were spectacular choices, and kinda is a real downer when you get some real talent mixed together and then instead of mixing carefully like you would stew, or soup to make sure it doesn't burn. They casually tossed around and just left there and waited till it was done.Ah the characters the character that brings this up by a solid point itself is Leapard, he hands down has the utmost amount of details around that are actually clear, and precise. Kannagi Itsuki is the second better of the two, and in my opinion the real main character of the series, though she has a serious martyr complex which tends to get on ones nerves quite fast unless you're into that type of thing.(IMO though i do like her character, I just wish she was more reasonable with her decision making.) Honoka Kawai...almost sounds like a bad pun...but with a good character making solid strides to a round character instead of a hexagon. Now we get to the one I absolutely detest...the famous 'I'm the hero of story so therefore everything i say or do must happen. If i say it needs love...(poof) it needs love, if i say it needs to be beaten down...(poof) we somehow manage to see some spectacular feat of shear amazing and raw stupidity.' This my friends and haters is Shishidou Akiha, the character this story centralizes around. The other characters are hardly worth noting for praise or otherwise pushing into a chamber of dread. They make solid progress as any normal character does, and then manage to revert to their original character which all in all is dissapointing if anything but not completely unheard of in a practical character make or break.Enjoyment is...well not really any at all, I decided to watch this on a whim because it sounded like it would be a pretty decent series if not to enjoy itself, but to kill some time, I even looked at the reviews which i've only gotten into recently so i was expecting something but sadly i must say that i had freaking face palm with my mouthopen and almost faceplanted my keyboard by episode 8. Was quite shocking to see a show so aimless, as many first time writers stories. This is also from Sunrise and Bandai two very big names instead and out of the anime business. Quite frankly that was more dissapointed then the show itself.Overall, this show really had something, but with reused sound effects, no character or story direction, and even incosistantsy all around, this show is something you should really avoid, though if you're gonna test your luck to see if it's actually enjoyable to you. More power to you, however it is doubtful if you have the eye for details as i do.Everything said and done, with a half-done review, this gets a 3, it's most redeeming feature so far being its art, its unlikely it has anything beyond that. then anything i've seen before?How was the sound? Did i like the Voice Actors selected for this series?Were the opening and ending songs likable enough for me to search for the band itself?

They make solid progress as any normal character does, and then manage to revert to their original character which all in all is dissapointing if anything but not completely unheard of in a practical character make or break.Enjoyment is...well not really any at all, I decided to watch this on a whim because it sounded like it would be a pretty decent series if not to enjoy itself, but to kill some time, I even looked at the reviews which i've only gotten into recently so i was expecting something but sadly i must say that i had freaking face palm with my mouthopen and almost faceplanted my keyboard by episode 8. Was quite shocking to see a show so aimless, as many first time writers stories. This is also from Sunrise and Bandai two very big names instead and out of the anime business. Quite frankly that was more dissapointed then the show itself.Overall, this show really had something, but with reused sound effects, no character or story direction, and even incosistantsy all around, this show is something you should really avoid, though if you're gonna test your luck to see if it's actually enjoyable to you. More power to you, however it is doubtful if you have the eye for details as i do.Everything said and done, with a half-done review, this gets a 3, it's most redeeming feature so far being its art, its unlikely it has anything beyond that.""]"
Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36726/Yuragi-sou_no_Yuuna-san,"['Every season, every year, there are new shows that you shouldn’t watch with your parents or little siblings around. The ecchi and harem category constitutes for bringing glorious fan service at every way possible. I’m not going to lie, watching Yuragi-sou n Yuuna-san (Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs) felt like diving into a pleasure of ecstasy.Based on the manga of the same name, it felt inevitable this show would eventually get animated on TV. It was just a matter of not if but when. The time came when the series decided to adapt itself into 12 episodes for a 1-cour season. What does that...mean? Well, that pretty much says the anime will not cover most of the material from the manga. It’s a disappointment to fans for who wanted to see some of their favorite chapters in anime form. But make no mistake, this show still has what it takes to bring on fan service to a level that is satisfying.It’s not rocket science to figure out but the show features a harem of girls and a main male protagonist. Fuyuora Kogarashi is the lucky (or perhaps misfortunate depending on how you look at it) guy with an ability to see supernatural entities. After training and learning to fight against spirits, he is now looking for a normal life. This lands him to a boarding house known as the Yuragi Manor where his life really takes a turn. Pretty simple story right? To be honest, this show’s plot is about as simple as it gets. Kogarashi is the standard protagonist who encounters a variety of beautiful girls. The most unusual one though is actually not human but takes the shape of a ghost. Meet Yuuna Yunohana, the female Casper of the inn!I’ll be straightforward here. You better get used to seeing fan service like ass, boobs, and compromising scenes often in the show. It’s an ecchi that doesn’t try to hide its intentions from day one. The first episode easily positions Kogarashi as an accidental pervert when he gets into some awkward moments with Yuuna. It’s a bit impractical considering Yuuna isn’t human but the show loves to create these moments for the sake of fan service. Despite being a ghost, Yuuna is actually very innocent when it comes to feelings and is very shy about herself. Unfortunately, we don’t truly know more about her past although the show makes it clear that she’s not malicious in any way or form. The character chemistry between her and Kogarashi is very noticeable as the two understands each other more.As a show with a harem, expect girls of all type of personalities. Ninja girl Sagiri is serious and overreacts when she is complimented by others. Yaya Fushiguro has a cat-like personality of always being curious with playful energy. Nonko adds more of the adult humor in this series with her carelessness and seemingly never taking anything serious (with exception of manga drawing) Chitose Nakai has a more mature personality and is very helpful towards others. Then, there’s Chisaki, a friendly girl that misunderstands many situations in the show especially regarding men. You get the big picture here? It’s a troupe of female characters that fills almost every category of harem archetypes.If you don’t fancy harem shows of similar nature (example: To-Love Ru), you’re not going to find much enjoyment here. And unfortunately, don’t expect much character development from them either. It’s a 12 episode show that pretty much dedicates itself like supernatural sit-com of misadventures. Almost every episode consists of story segments to show Kogarashi’s new unusual life. There’s going to be tons of misunderstandings and teasing all around. As it also contains supernatural elements, expect some common logic to be thrown out the doors.To be honest, I didn’t really care who the studio for this show would be in the end as long as they made the characters look faithful. Thankfully, that is the case even though a studio like Xebec took on the project. Oh who am I kidding? They did work on the To-Love Ru franchise before. Nonetheless, expect fan service to be saturated all over the place. Some of the moments from this series also reminds me of To-Love Ru especially when Kogarashi accidentally gropes a girl’s chest, ass, or some other private body part. The main selling point is the character reactions as some characters tends to overreact more than others (I’m looking at you, Sagiri, Yuuna, and Chisaki) There’s a lot of suggestive camera angles on the female characters so be ready for that too. While the technical quality of the show isn’t anything spectacular, it definitely leaves little to the imagination when it comes to that fan service.It’s a harem. It has fan service. It’s sexy. There are probably countless other words to describe Yuragi-sou no Yuuna but it’s pretty much you’d expect. There’s nothing really unique about it with its harem cast and daily shenanigans. I can say honestly that fan service can be sold well to an audience when it has a clear mission in mind. For this particular anime, they completed that mission. mean?

I beg to differ, because of what this show has been, it was a time waster but yet did find a fairly good time watching this overall.Story (just for contextual reasons as it serves very little meaning thereafter):Kogarashi Fuyuzora, our male harem MC, has had quite the life: He\'s a qualified spirit medium, trained from young to harness the ability to see, discern and exterminate evil spirits. However, his background is anything but noteworthy as he is poor and homeless, and...is searching for a place to reside in.Enter in the ""haunted"" Yuragi Inn, which he has found in the search for a lodging place, and is cheap due to the inn being haunted by a high school JK whose corpse was laid for as long as it has held. Nevertheless, Fuyuzora settles in and unwittingly does as the former popular inn now houses women of all dimensions (sexy, loli, you name it). Since it has always been his duty to purify ghosts, it is not until his encounter with the ghost, Yuuna Yunohara, changes his life upside-down (and eventually helping her to be purified as a good spirit)! Together with the residing women of Yuragi Inn whom look ordinary from the outside, but with their unique supernatural powers, our male harem MC\'s life will never ever be the same again!The story is just to provide the introduction to the main series overall, but what ""sets (the story) apart"" is with the characters who supports the episodic plots:Kogarashi Fuyuzora is more than just the dense harem joker, amidst from always falling prey into the seemingly endless amount of insane lewd ecchi moments, he\'s a solid character that does willingly as his motivation and passion of a spirit medium does, through trained possessed experiences as a child which shapes who he is ar his core.The residents of Yuragi Inn:Yuuna Yunohara the titular female ghost, has no recollection about her past existence, but the point through is that for seemingly some reason, her being bound to Yuragi Inn does not forebode well to the inn if it ever wants to receive customers again (who knows?), and therefore attaches herself to Kogarashi in order to find a cure to the bounded curse and be set free.Sagiri Ameno the demon-slaying ninja, with her sole purpose to venture and fulfill her clan obligliations to eliminate harmful and evil spirits. On the way, her tsundere-ness grows with the non-acceptable lewd and hidden love moments with Fuyuzora, to the point of her imagination running wild.Yaya Fushigoro the human-cat vessel for the Cat God, she serves the purpose of providing others with her power, while maintaining a dandere look, one that doesn\'t demand others attention, but yet when needed, she is a force to be reckoned with.Chitose Nakai the loli-looking girl who\'s the caretaker of Yuragi Inn, but with a definite twist of luck. That\'s because her power is manipulating the luck of the people of her choice, but with great power comes great consequences, so her power isn\'t used much. Other than that, despite her appearances, she is a great caretaker whom cares for everyone.Nonko Arahabaki the busty crude girl whom isn\'t afraid to show her affections...at the sight of alcohol, that which stores her power as an oni. Her side job of being an manga author is what she does to maintain her constant supply of alcohol. Always the proactive character, her power is one that must not be undermined.Other characters:Koyuzu Shigaraki, a raccoon kid who is capable of shapeshifting into other people, with the help of her leaf charms which by no surprise helps her be covert with her movements, and the overtime settlement at Yuragi Inn helps her coincide better with the girls and Fuyuzora.Chisaki Miyazaki, the oh-so-dull high school classmate, with the usual troupe of being popular for the most aestethical of traits, which is beauty. Similar to Sagiri, she is yet another tsundere that is aware of her own existence beside Fuyuzora, constantly having lewd thoughts and unable to maintain her stance (for majority of the time).Ryuuga Genshiro and Oborou Shinto, the male heir of his own clan and the half-daughter of the Black Dragon God bloodline. Mostly for filler (the manga covered a bit more), both characters won\'t stop at nothing to realize their ambitions, with Oboru subsequently moves to Yuragi Inn in the hopes of harbouring a child through Fuyuzora, and in the midst, you;ve guessed it once again, like Sagiri and Chisaki, another girl vying for Fuyuzora\'s naive attention.You\'d think that the whole host of characters are what defined the overall series, and you\'d be right to say that, because this show is entirely subserviant to the growth of the many characters, and for a sense, they all work their parts well.Xebec\'s production values are good to say the least since it\'s a harem rom-com series, and they don\'t have to take a lot of considerations and liberties with the source material (decent but good manga adaptation). Both the art and animation are neither striking nor noteworthy, but for what\'s presented here overall, I\'ll take it anyday. The character models are definitely unique and props to the character designers as they stand out and it\'s easy to discern the character traits. Overall, an easy-to-the-eye production with good art and animation that doesn\'t make you cringe a lot.The music is one that gives off the Slice-of-Life feels, yet it doesn\'t force you to grow on it much. Luna Haruna\'s OP definitely gives off that vibe, that it\'s a series that just explains its insane cheesy traits and it\'s good. Same with the ED by Yuuna, Sagiri and Chisaki, which supports the claim that whatever this anime wants it to be, ""Lets-a-go!"" with it. A good mix of genres I must say.If you\'re not a fan of trashy ecchi, I would ask you to turn away at this moment. What\'s not to love about ecchi series such as this one, while it takes your time away by watching and insulting trash, it certainly doesn\'t disappoint if you\'re one that doesn\'t take everything here seriously, and honestly it\'s just a good time overall. I\'d recommend this to diehard ecchi fans who just can\'t be milked enough from the genre. is searching for a place to reside in.Enter in the ""haunted"" Yuragi Inn, which he has found in the search for a lodging place, and is cheap due to the inn being haunted by a high school JK whose corpse was laid for as long as it has held.

After completing a case he got a recommendation to live in a very cheap onsen due to the bloody reputation of the inn. There he meets a ghost named Yuuna who because he does not have the heart to drive him away, he aims to find a way to get him out of this world without regret. But apparently this supernatural onsen incident is not from Yuuna alone.Story 6/10in terms of the story may be the story line composed by Miura...Tadahiro is easy to guess how the main characters such as how to cast spirits and othersArt 8/10maybe in the portion of the description I also do not really understand about the techniques and how to draw. if I think the picture made by Miura Tadahiro is pretty good from the eyes, body, and others.Character 7/10perhaps in terms of characters where the main player Fuyuzora Kogarashi has an above average power, where there is a scene of yuna and his ninjas are kidnapped by a black dragon and used as a hostage to be the wife of the black dragon, where there is a battle between black dragon and kogarashi. Black Dragon in the story is said to have the power of holy spirit / similar gods in the scene kogarashi just hit the black dragon with one punch and it makes the black dragon fainted.Enjoyment 10/10although this anime never reap the criticism because it has a scene that is too filthy, still this manga is quite good.

Once you get into your 30s, 40s, and beyond, you start to feel this longing for the things of your youth. Not just the most beloved things, but anything from your youth. My fellow boomers and I will dance to shit we HATED back in the 90s just because it’s from the 90s. Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs will set off an explosion of nostalgia for anyone who grew up watching shitty harem anime. This was made in 2018 but feels exactly like something that would...have come out in 2001. The Yuuna manga ran in Shonen Jump from 2016-2020 and really wanted to pay homage to the romcom mangaka of the past like Rumiko Takahashi and Ken Akamatsu. To be fair to Yuuna’s author, Tadahiro Miura, that’s exactly what this feels like. If you were to tell me that Ken and Rumiko met on vacation somewhere and made the first few chapters of this manga together, I would genuinely believe it!This is the story of a young man with spiritual powers named Kogarashi, who spent his childhood constantly getting possessed by ghosts. After the ghost of a failed day trader possessed him and made him go into crippling debt, he went into the countryside to find a Buddhist monk and master his psychic powers. After a few years of grueling training, Kogarashi is now a master exorcist and is OP as FUCK. When he hears about a haunted inn offering a room for dirt cheap, the utterly destitute Kogarashi shows up thinking it will be a quick exorcism and a peaceful life. Instead, the inn is home to a sexy ghost girl named Yuuna and a whole harem of supernatural babes.Unfortunately for this anime, audience tastes often change over time. The same show that would have sold 2 million DVDs and been a smash hit in 2001 was met with utter disdain in 2018. Funimation passed on it. Sentai passed. Aniplex got roped into licensing it, but then they just sat on the license and never released a dub or DVD/Bluray. Allegedly, this was after test audiences despised it. I can definitely see why Zoomers would hate this anime. This isn’t a “cool” ecchi like Mushoku where you can tell people you’re just into the magic system and the world building. This is the cringeworthy shit that your weird uncle that watches anime jerked off to 20 years ago. This is “guy slips on a banana peel and accidentally a grabs a boob” humor. In fact, there are SOO many scenes like that in Yuuna that it somehow becomes funny again! The fanservice in this show is relentless. Kogarashi is accidentally getting his face shoved into tits, ass, or vagina for what often feels like 30% of the runtime. It’s fucking insane! Despite all of this, I actually still loved this anime! Don’t worry, I’ll explain myself.So, what studio would put THIS amount of ass and titties in their anime? If you guessed Xebec, congratulations! You win a free trip to horny jail! This was one of the very last series that Xebec made before closing their doors forever. A fate that they shared around the same time as their longtime rival Studio Arms. Xebec burst onto the scene with the Love Hina anime and their entire history was mostly harem anime. These horny bastards did To Love-Ru, Shuffle, MM, Ladies Vs Butlers, Keijo, Mnemosyne, and a dozen others. This was their swansong and by God they wanted to go out showing as many titties as humanly possible. You know that really famous scene from Cinema Paradiso? The old film projectionist before he dies splices together all of the hundreds of romantic kiss scenes that the village priest forced him to cut out and it forms this beautiful compilation that represents his love for cinema and his life devoted to film. Well Yuuna is basically like that…only with titties. Xebec put in every single titty shot that they held back on in Shuffle and Love Hina and everything that came before. It is simply ludicrous how many titty shots are in this anime. I think you see every female character topless like 3 times every episode. This has to be the world record for a non-hentai anime. Interspecies Reviewers only has like maybe 1/4th as many titties as this show. Obviously watch the uncut version. Otherwise, what are you doing with your life?So why do I like this piece of shit? Firstly, a lot of the humor when not resorting to “oops I grabbed a booby” is actually funny. I was shocked that it managed to deliver so many genuinely clever gags. In one of my favorite episodes, Kogarashi is concerned about Yuuna’s lingering regret that’s keeping her bound to the Earth as a spirit. So, he takes her to an exclusive couple’s resort to try make her happy. He does this without thinking about the fact that nobody else can see her and everyone is going to think he’s just some loser who is SO lonely that he’s gone insane. The shenanigans that follow are quite hilarious. Part of what makes the humor work is that Kogarashi and Yuuna are actually likeable characters and their romantic chemistry together is sincerely good! As in better than 85% of romcom anime main couples. The side characters definitely borrow heavily from Love Hina and Ranma, but they manage to work. The cast has really solid comedic synergy and it makes every scene of them hanging out together enjoyable! Like their previous work on Shuffle, Xebec managed to squeeze in these really sweet moments that catch you completely off-guard because you’re just expecting some dumpster fire ecchi show. What is THIS? The anime that just showed me 300 mammaries in the last 15 minutes is actually making me feel things?So how does Yuuna compare to modern ecchi? I’m going to be honest here. Yuuna just beats the dog shit out of most modern ecchi anime. It’s not a fucking isekai. It’s not pretending to be better than what it actually is. Kogarashi isn’t just a “nice guy” who wants to help everyone around him with no ulterior motives. He’s much more than that. He’s also assertive, strong, and frankly admirable in his moral convictions. One girl desperately wants his seed because he’s super powerful and she will throw herself naked at him. He’ll calmly put her clothes back on and tell her that he’s only interested in doing that with the woman he loves. No nosebleed freak outs. No judgment. Just outright stating his feelings. Compared to most ecchi leads, Kogarashi is a fucking GigaChad. However, he also avoids being wish fulfillment bullshit. Kogarashi is not supposed to be us. He is an idealized positive example for young men to try living up to in the classic shonen sense. So many modern ecchi instead give us this lonely otaku who is “Just like me” but then he gains this power and starts desperately making up for all the ass he wasn’t getting in high school. Stories that mostly appeal to bitter, angry, single men in their 20s and 30s. That evolutionary tree within the ecchi family can pretty much directly be blamed on Rance, which led to Mushoku, which led to Shield Hero, Overlord, Redo of Healer, and SOO many others. I’m absolutely thrilled to see something that sprouted from the grandma Rumiko tree again. I’m sick to death of Rance and his offspring. Also, Yuuna is astoundingly wholesome compared to Higehiro, Domestic Girlfriend, Rent-A-Girlfriend, let alone anything from the Rance Family. The show with 500 boobies an episode is crushing modern ecchi in wholesomeness. That’s honestly very sad but it’s true.In conclusion, this absolutely should have received a dub and physical release in the US. If it really was a test audience that convinced Aniplex to do Yuuna dirty like that, I have something to say to them. In the immortal words of Michael Jordan, “Fuck them kids!” Yuuna frankly deserved WAY more love than it got back in 2018. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a masterpiece or anything. It is still kind of bad in some regards. Some of the running jokes do get a bit stale. The full-frontal nudity unfortunately extends to the 13-year-old innkeeper. Why Xebec? Why would you do this? The anime also left on a cliffhanger regarding Yuuna’s forgotten past that will never be resolved in anime form. The manga eventually answered all the questions, but this anime sure isn’t getting a second season. Yuuna does have some problems. However, this trashy ecchi is also worth your time. It’s only 12 episodes and it’s pretty damn enjoyable. I have to recommend this one. have come out in 2001.

If you were to tell me that Ken and Rumiko met on vacation somewhere and made the first few chapters of this manga together, I would genuinely believe it!This is the story of a young man with spiritual powers named Kogarashi, who spent his childhood constantly getting possessed by ghosts. After the ghost of a failed day trader possessed him and made him go into crippling debt, he went into the countryside to find a Buddhist monk and master his psychic powers. After a few years of grueling training, Kogarashi is now a master exorcist and is OP as FUCK. When he hears about a haunted inn offering a room for dirt cheap, the utterly destitute Kogarashi shows up thinking it will be a quick exorcism and a peaceful life. Instead, the inn is home to a sexy ghost girl named Yuuna and a whole harem of supernatural babes.Unfortunately for this anime, audience tastes often change over time. The same show that would have sold 2 million DVDs and been a smash hit in 2001 was met with utter disdain in 2018. Funimation passed on it. Sentai passed. Aniplex got roped into licensing it, but then they just sat on the license and never released a dub or DVD/Bluray. Allegedly, this was after test audiences despised it. I can definitely see why Zoomers would hate this anime. This isn’t a “cool” ecchi like Mushoku where you can tell people you’re just into the magic system and the world building. This is the cringeworthy shit that your weird uncle that watches anime jerked off to 20 years ago. This is “guy slips on a banana peel and accidentally a grabs a boob” humor. In fact, there are SOO many scenes like that in Yuuna that it somehow becomes funny again! The fanservice in this show is relentless. Kogarashi is accidentally getting his face shoved into tits, ass, or vagina for what often feels like 30% of the runtime. It’s fucking insane! Despite all of this, I actually still loved this anime! Don’t worry, I’ll explain myself.So, what studio would put THIS amount of ass and titties in their anime? If you guessed Xebec, congratulations! You win a free trip to horny jail! This was one of the very last series that Xebec made before closing their doors forever. A fate that they shared around the same time as their longtime rival Studio Arms. Xebec burst onto the scene with the Love Hina anime and their entire history was mostly harem anime. These horny bastards did To Love-Ru, Shuffle, MM, Ladies Vs Butlers, Keijo, Mnemosyne, and a dozen others. This was their swansong and by God they wanted to go out showing as many titties as humanly possible. You know that really famous scene from Cinema Paradiso? The old film projectionist before he dies splices together all of the hundreds of romantic kiss scenes that the village priest forced him to cut out and it forms this beautiful compilation that represents his love for cinema and his life devoted to film. Well Yuuna is basically like that…only with titties. Xebec put in every single titty shot that they held back on in Shuffle and Love Hina and everything that came before. It is simply ludicrous how many titty shots are in this anime. I think you see every female character topless like 3 times every episode. This has to be the world record for a non-hentai anime. Interspecies Reviewers only has like maybe 1/4th as many titties as this show. Obviously watch the uncut version. Otherwise, what are you doing with your life?So why do I like this piece of shit? Firstly, a lot of the humor when not resorting to “oops I grabbed a booby” is actually funny. I was shocked that it managed to deliver so many genuinely clever gags. In one of my favorite episodes, Kogarashi is concerned about Yuuna’s lingering regret that’s keeping her bound to the Earth as a spirit. So, he takes her to an exclusive couple’s resort to try make her happy. He does this without thinking about the fact that nobody else can see her and everyone is going to think he’s just some loser who is SO lonely that he’s gone insane. The shenanigans that follow are quite hilarious. Part of what makes the humor work is that Kogarashi and Yuuna are actually likeable characters and their romantic chemistry together is sincerely good! As in better than 85% of romcom anime main couples. The side characters definitely borrow heavily from Love Hina and Ranma, but they manage to work. The cast has really solid comedic synergy and it makes every scene of them hanging out together enjoyable! Like their previous work on Shuffle, Xebec managed to squeeze in these really sweet moments that catch you completely off-guard because you’re just expecting some dumpster fire ecchi show. What is THIS? The anime that just showed me 300 mammaries in the last 15 minutes is actually making me feel things?So how does Yuuna compare to modern ecchi? I’m going to be honest here. Yuuna just beats the dog shit out of most modern ecchi anime. It’s not a fucking isekai. It’s not pretending to be better than what it actually is. Kogarashi isn’t just a “nice guy” who wants to help everyone around him with no ulterior motives. He’s much more than that. He’s also assertive, strong, and frankly admirable in his moral convictions. One girl desperately wants his seed because he’s super powerful and she will throw herself naked at him. He’ll calmly put her clothes back on and tell her that he’s only interested in doing that with the woman he loves. No nosebleed freak outs. No judgment. Just outright stating his feelings. Compared to most ecchi leads, Kogarashi is a fucking GigaChad. However, he also avoids being wish fulfillment bullshit. Kogarashi is not supposed to be us. He is an idealized positive example for young men to try living up to in the classic shonen sense. So many modern ecchi instead give us this lonely otaku who is “Just like me” but then he gains this power and starts desperately making up for all the ass he wasn’t getting in high school. Stories that mostly appeal to bitter, angry, single men in their 20s and 30s. That evolutionary tree within the ecchi family can pretty much directly be blamed on Rance, which led to Mushoku, which led to Shield Hero, Overlord, Redo of Healer, and SOO many others. I’m absolutely thrilled to see something that sprouted from the grandma Rumiko tree again. I’m sick to death of Rance and his offspring. Also, Yuuna is astoundingly wholesome compared to Higehiro, Domestic Girlfriend, Rent-A-Girlfriend, let alone anything from the Rance Family. The show with 500 boobies an episode is crushing modern ecchi in wholesomeness. That’s honestly very sad but it’s true.In conclusion, this absolutely should have received a dub and physical release in the US. If it really was a test audience that convinced Aniplex to do Yuuna dirty like that, I have something to say to them. In the immortal words of Michael Jordan, “Fuck them kids!” Yuuna frankly deserved WAY more love than it got back in 2018. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a masterpiece or anything. It is still kind of bad in some regards. Some of the running jokes do get a bit stale. The full-frontal nudity unfortunately extends to the 13-year-old innkeeper. Why Xebec? Why would you do this? The anime also left on a cliffhanger regarding Yuuna’s forgotten past that will never be resolved in anime form. The manga eventually answered all the questions, but this anime sure isn’t getting a second season. Yuuna does have some problems. However, this trashy ecchi is also worth your time. It’s only 12 episodes and it’s pretty damn enjoyable. I have to recommend this one.', 'Dear god I would have so much money if I had a quarter for every time this series did the lucky pervert trope.\xa0 We would literally be down half a show in that

However, there does seem to be quite a few tsundere types though which sometimes gets annoying.There doesn't seem to be an overall plot to the show so it feels like you're watching a slice of life

Except that fails in the third component of the ""ecchi harem romance"" and especially in the supernatural segments. Go with caution as there\'ll be some spoilers.Story (4/10):Fuyuzora Kogarashi is a spirit medium that got broke and found a mysterious dorm called the Yuragi-sou (Yuragi Inn) where it says it\'s haunted by the ghost of a girl named Yuuna Yunohana. There is also a bunch of strange inhabitants like the ninja Sagiri Ameno, innkeeper Chitose Nakai that can manipulate one\'s fortune, Nonko Aharabaki, an ultra drunk well endowed mangaka,...and much more.The plot is to help Ms. Yuuna Yunohara to find her personal lingering regret with the help of our main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi (read with Sagiri Ameno\'s voice), except that everything happens but the actual finding of Yuuna\'s lingering regret.Normally, in an ecchi harem romance anime, I usually expect a bunch of ""accidental"" boob grabbing, nice panties shots, funny deredere reactions from the girls and the harem male lead, and some intimate moments. In the last part is where Yuragi-sou fails a lot, very few moments of romantic moments, except the punctual situations of the Yuuna-Fuyuzora Kogarashi date in a hot spring and the Sagiri love poisoned segment.The two ""arcs"" that have a certain relevance with the supernatural beings are the Black Dragon God arc where Fuyuzora Kogarashi with Sagiri and Koyuzu go on a mission to rescue Yuuna; and the final arc of the season where there is a couple in torment because of an accident of the boyfriend, wihich Fuyuzora Kogarashi and Yuuna help them to leave this world in peace.The worst part is that we have very few of the ""supernatural"" parts which I think they could have made wonders for Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san, rather it\'s much more focused on the comedy aspect with a blend with slice-of-boob-life moments. I don\'t expect a High School DxD or a Zero no Tsukaima every season, but if you don\'t wanna consider the supernatural element of here, please make this anime more slice-of-lifey.While I suggest you to wait for the uncensored version as you\'ll enjoy better this ecchi harem romance anime in its full ""glory"", you should also go here with the mentality to just watch tits and ass and boob grabbings, nothing else.Art (6/10):Nothing too much impressive for a low budget ecchi harem romance anime, all girls check my expectations for a ecchi harem romance series with all the physical attractiveness possible forms, from the very well endowed Nonko to the lolis Koyuzu and Chitose, not forgetting the middle of the roads Sagiri, Yuuna and Chisaki.Animation looks quite acceptable and the backgrounds are relatively decent to not put you off in any moment.Sound (5/10):The soundtrack is nothing otherworldly, but nothing disappointing, it compliments the relative mediocrity of Yuragi-sou. The OP and ED are quite unremarkable and never entertaining to the point to not google it to hear the full version, which I generally do with at least one of the themes.Characters (7/10):Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs has a very amicable and nice cast that surprised me why the rest of the series doesn\'t give more supernatural feelings, considering the nature of a 70% of the characters featured here:Our main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi is a very strong medium that has helped several ghost in pain to ascend to Heaven. Now wanting to enjoy a normal life, changes school struck with Yuuna, he plateaus quite a lot and starts to enjoy the life in the Yuragi Inn, which is quite understandable with the all hot bishis there.Yuuna Yunohara is the ghost of a bound girl who was found dead in the Yuragi-sou, her poltergeist talent is quite strongs that activaces mainly because Fuyuzora Kogarashi keeps touching her unconsciously and then she throws her to the water. Yuuna never knows what happened before her dead and has amnesia.Sagiri Ameno is a cold blooded ninja that trains consistently and in typical tsundere fashion, she occults all her feelings to Fuyuzora Kogarashi, even when love-poisoned, she manages to keep some of her cool aura around her.Chisaki Miyazawa is classical hottest girl in high school that doesn\'t believe in spiritual things, but by encountering Fuyuzora Kogarashi, she starts to feel something for him and gets to know better the rest of the girls of the Yuragi-sou, even the unseen Yuuna.Of the rest of the cast, the most importants are the well endowed drunkie Nonko Aharabaki, the feline Yaya Fugishiro, the lolis Chitose Nakai and Koyuzu Shigaraki, and the ex servant of the Black Dragon Lord Oboro Shintou, who in classical Xenovia fashion, she wants the genes of Fuyozora Kogarashi.Enjoyment (5/10):Of course as a man of culture who appreciates their ecchi harem romance anime will sure enjoy quite a lot of the series as they tick all the necessary ingredients to enjoy this kind of series. However, don\'t expect much more in here, as the supernatural part here is quite mediocre and the romance is reduced to minimal situations.As a final comment, I\'ll be surely waiting the uncensored version to have better pleasant visuals of the hot bishis of here, and a possible new season, hoping that in there we can have much more supernatural elements to enhace this cute ecchi harem romance anime.Final Score: 5/10. It\'s very improvable show, but was quite bad executed. and much more.The plot is to help Ms. Yuuna Yunohara to find her personal lingering regret with the help of our main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi (read with Sagiri Ameno\'s voice), except that everything happens but the actual finding of Yuuna\'s lingering regret.Normally, in an ecchi harem romance anime, I usually expect a bunch of ""accidental"" boob grabbing, nice panties shots, funny deredere reactions from the girls and the harem male lead, and some intimate moments. In the last part is where Yuragi-sou fails a lot, very few moments of romantic moments, except the punctual situations of the Yuuna-Fuyuzora Kogarashi date in a hot spring and the Sagiri love poisoned segment.The two ""arcs"" that have a certain relevance with the supernatural beings are the Black Dragon God arc where Fuyuzora Kogarashi with Sagiri and Koyuzu go on a mission to rescue Yuuna; and the final arc of the season where there is a couple in torment because of an accident of the boyfriend, wihich Fuyuzora Kogarashi and Yuuna help them to leave this world in peace.The worst part is that we have very few of the ""supernatural"" parts which I think they could have made wonders for Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san, rather it\'s much more focused on the comedy aspect with a blend with slice-of-boob-life moments. I don\'t expect a High School DxD or a Zero no Tsukaima every season, but if you don\'t wanna consider the supernatural element of here, please make this anime more slice-of-lifey.While I suggest you to wait for the uncensored version as you\'ll enjoy better this ecchi harem romance anime in its full ""glory"", you should also go here with the mentality to just watch tits and ass and boob grabbings, nothing else.Art (6/10):Nothing too much impressive for a low budget ecchi harem romance anime, all girls check my expectations for a ecchi harem romance series with all the physical attractiveness possible forms, from the very well endowed Nonko to the lolis Koyuzu and Chitose, not forgetting the middle of the roads Sagiri, Yuuna and Chisaki.Animation looks quite acceptable and the backgrounds are relatively decent to not put you off in any moment.Sound (5/10):The soundtrack is nothing otherworldly, but nothing disappointing, it compliments the relative mediocrity of Yuragi-sou. The OP and ED are quite unremarkable and never entertaining to the point to not google it to hear the full version, which I generally do with at least one of the themes.Characters (7/10):Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs has a very amicable and nice cast that surprised me why the rest of the series doesn\'t give more supernatural feelings, considering the nature of a 70% of the characters featured here:Our main character Fuyuzora Kogarashi is a very strong medium that has helped several ghost in pain to ascend to Heaven. Now wanting to enjoy a normal life, changes school struck with Yuuna, he plateaus quite a lot and starts to enjoy the life in the Yuragi Inn, which is quite understandable with the all hot bishis there.Yuuna Yunohara is the ghost of a bound girl who was found dead in the Yuragi-sou, her poltergeist talent is quite strongs that activaces mainly because Fuyuzora Kogarashi keeps touching her unconsciously and then she throws her to the water. Yuuna never knows what happened before her dead and has amnesia.Sagiri Ameno is a cold blooded ninja that trains consistently and in typical tsundere fashion, she occults all her feelings to Fuyuzora Kogarashi, even when love-poisoned, she manages to keep some of her cool aura around her.Chisaki Miyazawa is classical hottest girl in high school that doesn\'t believe in spiritual things, but by encountering Fuyuzora Kogarashi, she starts to feel something for him and gets to know better the rest of the girls of the Yuragi-sou, even the unseen Yuuna.Of the rest of the cast, the most importants are the well endowed drunkie Nonko Aharabaki, the feline Yaya Fugishiro, the lolis Chitose Nakai and Koyuzu Shigaraki, and the ex servant of the Black Dragon Lord Oboro Shintou, who in classical Xenovia fashion, she wants the genes of Fuyozora Kogarashi.Enjoyment (5/10):Of course as a man of culture who appreciates their ecchi harem romance anime will sure enjoy quite a lot of the series as they tick all the necessary ingredients to enjoy this kind of series. However, don\'t expect much more in here, as the supernatural part here is quite mediocre and the romance is reduced to minimal situations.As a final comment, I\'ll be surely waiting the uncensored version to have better pleasant visuals of the hot bishis of here, and a possible new season, hoping that in there we can have much more supernatural elements to enhace this cute ecchi harem romance anime.Final Score: 5/10.

You have been warned.Based off a popular manga of the same name Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san better known as Yuuna and the hot springs inn is a supernatural romantic comedy that also includes elements of Ecchi within it that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a spirit medium that despite being born with the rare ability to see and interact with spirits encounters...enough misfortune that can sink a battleship were to be introduced to a seemly cheap boarding house called Yuragi manor that’s available for him to rent. What's the catch you may ask. Well the inn you see is haunted by a beautiful girl called Yuuna that coincidently lives in the room that you chose to rent.Romantic comedy’s like Yuragi aren’t anything that’s rare within the industry given how easy it is to create them but inserting not just ghosts but also various types of supernatural creatures like Oni’s, Cat gods, Zashiki Warashi, Tanuki’s and demon slaying ninja’s is something that’s not just unusual but also quite wacky as well something that I felt this series was aiming for all along. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that did a good job of introducing both the main character Koga and his profession and skills as a spirit medium and the titular character of Yuuna and made enough of an impression on me that I decided to watch the series to the very end.Taking place within the modern day Yuuna and the hot springs inn is largely set within the titular boarding house and the town Yukemuri town that it inhabits. The boarding house which was formerly a famous hot springs inn that was relatively famous within the local area had shown a steep decline in visitors due to the number of increasing supernatural incidents that had started to take place within the inn. The overall story of the series follows the life of Kogarashi Fuzuyora a 16-year-old teenager who as a result of being born with the rare ability to not just see and interact with spirits but be able to be possessed by them has found his life to be one that consists of nothing but misfortune. So bad in fact that despite being a high school freshman Koga still hasn’t managed to secure a place to lodge yet even as his first day is edging ever closer. However, one day after banishing a particularly pesky spirit Koga hears of a boarding house that doesn’t just have a free room but also one that’s unbelievably cheap as well. Despite the seemingly sketchy nature of the boarding house in question Koga glad only that he had a place to stay thought none of it and decided to take up the offer. But never did Koga expect to find himself sharing his room with a beautiful teenage ghost that has amnesia but also finds himself living with a host of beautiful girls that inhabit the boarding house that are anything but human.But as Koga gets over the initial shock and begins to settle into both the boarding house and into the life of a high school student Koga starts to realize that while Yuuna and the members of the boarding house may not be your average housemates each of them despite being powerful and unique individuals of their own right have their own fears, insecurities and aspirations that constrain them things that Koga himself knows and understands all too well.As Koga starts to gradually bond with the house’s inhabitants and help them overcome their problems Koga not just gains something that’s been lacking in his life due to his unique skill set which is that of friendship but also come to realize that despite not being full humans the inhabitants of the boarding house can be just as kind, thoughtful and helpful as they are and that their unique skill sets can become unexpectedly handy when the human’s come under threat from the many malevolent and wacky opponents that start to show up. Joining Koga in this comedy filled adventure are a host of characters that include the friendly but overactive Yuuna, the kind and honest Chisaki and the sharp-tongued but unexpectedly insecure Sagiri.KogarashiKogarashi voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Food Wars and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and a rare example of a psychic user that cannot just see and interact with spirits but also be able to banish them with his fist Kogarashi in the beginning of the series was shown to be a kind, caring and honest person that while homeless and poor in the beginning did not let this affect his outlook on life. A friendly, intelligent and joking person by nature Koga while unused to having friends at the beginning of the due to the side effects his abilities give him was shown to someone that was not just able to forge friendships easily but also someone that was noted to be very loyal to them and willing to do his utmost to help them overcome their problems no matter what problems it is. Unlike most psychic users that are able to interact with spirits Kogarashi is someone that can be said to be more open-minded than most as he prefers to judge spirits based on their actions rather than on their physical appearance and as a result prefers to first get to know the spirits as individuals and understand them rather than say banish them on sight as most other psychic users would have. This within the series is shown in how Kogarashi met and interacted with Yuuna and how he handled the demon that showed up during the seaside trip that his class went on. While someone that is seen to dislike the more militant aspects of psychic mediums Kogaraishi is shown to be someone that’s not afraid of using physical force if it meant that it can help protect his friends from harm. Despite the seemingly questionable nature of his role as a psychic Kogarashi is seen to be someone that’s proud of his abilities despite the great misfortune that this had subjected to his life too which is shown in his willingness to reveal his job to others and offering to use his skills to help those that are in need despite the ridicule that Kogarashi knows would result.As the series goes on and more of Kogarashi’s personality is revealed his personality gradually starts to change. While shown to be someone that had been blessed with the rather unusual ability of not just being a psychic user but also being one that was born with the ability to be a spirit medium it can be seen that Kogaraishi did not view this blessed ability with anything approaching joy. While happy that his ability enables him to be able to not just interact with spirits but also banish those that are shown to be of a visible danger to humans it can be seen that this ability is something of a double-edged sword to him as while useful it also had the rather unfortunate side effect of making Kogarashi’s life a literal hell as his status of a spirit medium meant that Kogaraishi often ended being possessed by various spirits whose vastly differing personalities caused him to undertake many actions that had the effect of causing him to be marked by society as a weirdo and ensured that Kogarashi had few of any friends prior to his arrival at the inn.However, while making his life hell its interesting to see that this past of his also created something of a silver lining for each of the spirits that possessed him despite leaving his body left behind the many innate skills that they had attained when they were alive skills that not just varied but also proved to be extremely useful to Kogarashi within the series as he protected his friends. The number and variety of skills that Kogarashi had as a result of the spirits I felt were interesting and impressive and I felt more than made up for his past. While shown to be a friendly person and someone that made his decision after giving it much thought it can be seen that this attitude of his changes when he sees his friends lives at stake and indeed in this state it can be seen that Kogarashi actually loses his calm and laid back attitude and instead adopt one that’s not just determined but also willing to fight hard to save and protect them even if it meant that do some questionable things like storm a palace almost single handily which is best shown in his rescue of Yuuna from the dragon gods palace.The character of Kogarashi I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his evolution from a quiet, friendly and laid-back person to one that was determined to make actual friends and protect them from harm with his unique abilities being especially well done. Given the hell that his abilities caused him I'm actually quite surprised that Koga not only resisted the urge to resent his powers but instead realize how useful it can be if it was used to calm and befriend spirits which is another thing that I admired about Kogarashi’s character. I felt that his voice actor Yuuki Ono did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kogarashi.YuunaYuuna voiced by new seiyuu Miyuri Shimabukuro is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Koga’s friends within the series. A ghost girl that Koga encounters early in the series after unknowingly renting the room that served as her home within the boarding house and thus making Yuuna his roommate. A curious, nervous but polite ghost Yuuna despite being a ghost is someone that comes off as something that’s different to what most people imagine ghosts to be as Yuuna far from being malevolent is actually someone that’s innocent, friendly and kind. As a result of both the fact that she’s a ghost and the fact that the boarding house that she calls her home has seen a massive decline in tenants Yuuna in the beginning of the series can be seen to be someone that was relatively lonely as she lacked any real opportunities to make any new friends. As a result of this upon meeting Koga Yuuna was seen to have become overjoyed at the thought that she will be able to forge a new friendship with someone new and as a result was able to forge an immediate friendship with Koga. This immediate bond of friendship that Yuuna forges with Koga was aided greatly by the fact that Koga was different to the other tenants of the inn in that while he was human he also had the unique ability to not only see and interact with spirits but also by the fact that he treats them with respect rather than simply banish them like many of their kind would. This curiosity to Koga and the fact that he defended her from an attack served to form a strong bond between the two that only grew stronger as the series went on. While a friendly and curious ghost that was seemingly carefree it can be seen that Yuuna was someone that was quite perceptive and was shown to be conscious of Koga’s attempts to help her attain her wish something that was both heartening to her and at the same time scary to her due to her inner conflicts that only increased as the series went on.Despite being a ghost, it can be seen that Yuuna still has a surprisingly number of things that and places that she wants to be able to do and see with some of them being quite normal like being able to go to school and going on a school trip with others and others being rather unique like having a sleepover and trading secrets with her fellow girls. This I felt was interesting as fulfilling these wishes for her actually allowed Koga and the others the opportunity to give Yuuna the school life that she wasn’t able to have due to her early demise.As the series goes on and as Yuuna gets to not just encounter and befriend Koga but also meet many other people her personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series while initially wary of Koga due to his abilities as a psychic this feeling of distrust gradually vanished due to the kindness that was shown to her by him and she became very loyal to Koga acting as both a constant companion to him and a valued friend. This bond with both Koga and the many tenants within the boarding house only served to deepen as the series went on and indeed by the latter points of the series the bonds that Yuuna had managed to forge with Koga and the tenants while allowing her to forge many new friendships also served to make her realize just how important such bonds were and causing her to become much more protective of her friends to the point that she will be willing to use herself as a means to protect them.While content to simply observe and accompany Koga in his daily activities in the beginning of the series this attitude of Yuuna gradually starts to change as she gets to bear witness to the efforts that Koga puts in to protect those dear to him from harm which had the effect of causing her to realize that unlike him she was clumsy, naïve and would do more harm than good if she tried to help. However rather than let these negative feelings affect her it can be said that this actually had the opposite effect as this prompted her to not just analyze her own strengths and weaknesses but also try to improve her skills and knowledge as she tries to be of better use to Koga. This I felt was interesting as it showed not just her determination to improve herself but also of her determination to be of better use to Koga someone that she grows increasingly fond off as the series goes on.ChisakiChisaki Miyazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Amanchu and Toji no Miko fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga’s classmates and friends within the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and the class idol within Koga’s class Chisaki from initial impressions were seen to be someone that was kind, honest and understanding of others and while appreciative of the fame and praise that comes from her classmates Chisaki doesn’t let this affect her core personality. Indeed, despite the fame Chisaki rather than being arrogant and prideful as some girls in her position will be is instead someone that’s friendly, honest, considerate and caring to all she meets and ensuring that she has no shortage of friends within the school. While an open minded and kind person by nature Chisaki is also shown to be someone that’s wary of outsiders and is someone that trusts slowly due to the number of people that would like to be her friend and as a result was shown to be quite wary of Koga at the beginning of the series.Indeed, Chisaki at the beginning like her fellow classmates while curious about Koga’s declaration that he was a psychic and had the ability to interact with spirits thought that it was just another attempt to make himself look more interesting to others. However, this later changed after Chisaki found herself the target of a malicious spirit that forced her to enlist the help of Koga despite the fact that she was still skeptical of his abilities. While the experience of seeing a spirit be not just revealed but convinced to stop their activities was an educational experience for Chisaki the unintended actions of Koga’s tag along spirit Yuuna caused Chisaki to have a rather bad first impression of Koga and saw him as a violent pervert much to Koga’s dismay. However, after seeing the way Koga resolved the situation with the spirit this attitude of her’s gradually starts to change.As the series goes on and as Chisaki begins to realize that Koga’s abilities weren’t just real but also that unknown to her and the general population creatures other than humans were coexisting with them. While understandably unnerved at this thought it can be seen that rather be frightened of this new revelation Chisaki due to her strong curiosity instead become more interested in this new world that was seemingly hidden from view as well as the various events that happen inside Koga’s world. While developing an intense interest into both the world and into Koga as the series goes on this also extends to Yuuna as well. Unlike most people her age Chisaki while scared of Yuuna at first due to the fact that she was a ghost gradually got over this fear as she interacted with her and realized that far from being a malevolent spirit Yuuna was someone that was very similar to her both in terms of age and life experiences and as a result become fast friends.This aspect of their bonding with each other within the series I felt was interesting as it proved to be an educational experience for both of them as they both sought to learn about each other and it was quite funny seeing the two converse with each other via messages. The character of Chisaki I felt was an interesting one and one that was developed quite well as the series went on. Her development from someone that while kind and caring was dismissive of things that she couldn’t see to one where she was more open-minded and more willing to believe in not just the abilities of others but also of the fact that in this world beings that she hasn’t seen before can indeed exist I felt was done well. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki did an excellent job of portraying the character of Chisaki.SagiriSagiri Ameno voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Comic Girls fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga’s friends within the series. A teenage girl and a Kunoichi of the Chuuma ninja army Sagiri at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was cold, direct and sharp-tongued and while a beautiful girl was widely seen as unapproachable by many within the school that she goes due to both her intimidating presence and also because of the fact that she sees all men as enemies due to her upbringing within a single gender school. As a result of this at the beginning of the series it’s perhaps unsurprising to see that Sagiri had a very antagonistic relationship with Koga as she believed that like all men Koga was nothing more than a beast that took advantage of vulnerable woman and as a result was not just protective of her fellow tenants but also showed a intense desire to fillet Koga with her kunai if she sees him do actions that she sees as suspicious which thanks to Yuuna is commonplace within the series.However, while someone that trusts others slowly and reacts brashly it can be seen that Sagiri is someone that has a firm sense of honor and is someone that both places a lot of trust in promises and someone that adheres to them no matter what kind of promises it was. In line with  Sagiri’s firm sense of honor is something that can be seen to be the core of her motivation as both a person and a woman which is her firm sense of justice and her loyalty to the role as a Kunoichi that maintains the peace between the human and spirit realms a role that Sagiri is seen to be very loyal to.As the series goes on and as Sagiri gets to not just encounter new situations but also meet many people that she never thought she will become friends with Sagiri’s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset of the series, it can be seen that Sagiri while very loyal to her role as a kunoichi of the Chuuma school was someone that actually placed an emphasis on the former and as such placed a higher emphasis on her role as a ninja than that of a woman. This, when combined with the fact that Sagiri was educated in a single gender school, meant that she was both unused to how to converse with boys her age and unaware of the effect that her figure and beauty had on them which had the unfortunate effect of making her dislike boys due to her series of misunderstandings. However, as the series goes on and Sagiri gets to not just partner up with her self-proclaimed enemy Koga but also understand the effects that she has on people this attitude of her’s gradually starts to change. In addition to her attitude towards boys becoming much softer and friendlier this change also had the unusual effect of awakening within Sagiri an inner fear of sorts where Sagiri develops a fear of the fact that she does not look feminine enough despite the fact that she’s seen as one of the most beautiful girls within the school. This act of insecurity only served to expand as a result of seeing the kind of figures that her friend Chisaki and her housemate Nonko had and awakened within Sagiri a strong desire to try and change herself physically by adopting a new change in wardrobe.This inner struggle of Sagiri’s I felt was interesting as it while it did a great job of contrasting between her default direct and brash personality it also showed an obvious character development of her that came about as a result of not bonding with Koga but also realizing that so far in life she has been keeping an unnecessary distance between people of other genders. While shown to be very loyal to her duties and her ninja school in the beginning as the series goes on and as Sagiri gradually starts to realize just how valuable friendship can be to her this loyalty is supplemented by her loyalty to her friends and indeed it can be seen that at this point Sagiri is willing to act against the interests of her duties if it meant that she can save her friends from a nasty situation a decision that the Sagiri of the past would have scoffed at which is best shown in the attempted rescue mission that she enacted to save Yuuna from the dragon god.The character of Sagiri I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a cold, blunt and sharp-tongued girl that treated all men with suspicion to one that was not just friendlier but also more understanding of others feelings being especially well done. I felt that Sagiri’s development of the inner insecurity within her and her quest to become more feminine was used really well within the series to show not just her gradual realization of how attractive her figure was to others but also to indicate her growing feelings towards Koga. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sagiri.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were pretty well done with the characters designs doing a good job of reflecting the type of species that their true self was and the types of traits that they possessed. A good example of this within the series was Yaya’s default behavior and Nakai’s guise as an inn master that had dual personalities that differed from each other. Settings wise I thought the series made great use of a variety of terrain that did a great job of showing the kind of locations that can exist within the world. Of this, I felt that the dragon palace which was the home of the dragon god Genshiro was perhaps my favorite. While combat within the series wasn’t especially common given Koga’s determination to use diplomacy first and violence second I thought that the few fights that were within the series were well done with Koga and Sagiri’s fight with the stripping monster and the brief fight between Koga and Genshiro being notable ones.In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of providing an effective soundtrack to the many wacky moments within the series. The series opening and ending themes which were Momoiro Typhoon that was sung by veteran singer Luna Haruna and Happen Kogarashi Ni Fukarete which was sung by Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki and Rie Takahashi in the guise of their characters I felt were both fun and catchy songs. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main characters or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Yuuki Ono, Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki, and Rie Takahashi all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Kogarashi, Yuuna, Chisaki and Sagiri respectively. In addition, while I didn’t cover them within this review, I felt that Yui Ogura, Ai Kakuma, Sayaka Harada , Mikako Komatsu and Yoshimasa Hosoya all did an excellent job at portraying the supporting cast of Yaya, Nonko, Nakai, Oboro and Genshiro respectively.Overall conclusionOverall Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, interesting characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of fantasy creatures and supernatural elements into a typical school harem story. While the inclusion of supernatural elements like Yuuna and fantasy creatures like Oni’s, cat god vessels and Zashiki Warashi within the series was a welcome change from what we usually see within harem animes I felt these weren’t really used that well within the series due to their lack of character development which I felt was a shame. This was in contrast to the development that was given to the human characters of Sagiri and Chisaki who within the series I felt was developed pretty well with Sagiri, in particular, changing the most compared to how she was at the start of the series. The overall story of the series while funny wacky and featuring plenty of good examples of clothes shredding scenes I felt was too predictable and genetic and added little to make it stand out when compared to others within the genre. However, despite this, the story was not without its funny moments and these served to provide a great deal of entertainment to me as I watched the story unfold.Overall I felt that if Yuragi was given much better character development and some more unique scenarios that made use of the fantasy creatures then perhaps it might be more entertaining but as it is if you want an anime that’s funny, simple and ones that features plenty of clothes shredding moments then you should give Yuragi a try. As a final score, I would say Yuragi deserves a final score of 7/10. enough misfortune that can sink a battleship were to be introduced to a seemly cheap boarding house called Yuragi manor that’s available for him to rent. What's the catch you may ask. Well the inn you see is haunted by a beautiful girl called Yuuna that coincidently lives in the room that you chose to rent.Romantic comedy’s like Yuragi aren’t anything that’s rare within the industry given how easy it is to create them but inserting not just ghosts but also various types of supernatural creatures like Oni’s, Cat gods, Zashiki Warashi, Tanuki’s and demon slaying ninja’s is something that’s not just unusual but also quite wacky as well something that I felt this series was aiming for all along. The first episode of the series I felt was an interesting one that did a good job of introducing both the main character Koga and his profession and skills as a spirit medium and the titular character of Yuuna and made enough of an impression on me that I decided to watch the series to the very end.Taking place within the modern day Yuuna and the hot springs inn is largely set within the titular boarding house and the town Yukemuri town that it inhabits. The boarding house which was formerly a famous hot springs inn that was relatively famous within the local area had shown a steep decline in visitors due to the number of increasing supernatural incidents that had started to take place within the inn. The overall story of the series follows the life of Kogarashi Fuzuyora a 16-year-old teenager who as a result of being born with the rare ability to not just see and interact with spirits but be able to be possessed by them has found his life to be one that consists of nothing but misfortune. So bad in fact that despite being a high school freshman Koga still hasn’t managed to secure a place to lodge yet even as his first day is edging ever closer. However, one day after banishing a particularly pesky spirit Koga hears of a boarding house that doesn’t just have a free room but also one that’s unbelievably cheap as well. Despite the seemingly sketchy nature of the boarding house in question Koga glad only that he had a place to stay thought none of it and decided to take up the offer. But never did Koga expect to find himself sharing his room with a beautiful teenage ghost that has amnesia but also finds himself living with a host of beautiful girls that inhabit the boarding house that are anything but human.But as Koga gets over the initial shock and begins to settle into both the boarding house and into the life of a high school student Koga starts to realize that while Yuuna and the members of the boarding house may not be your average housemates each of them despite being powerful and unique individuals of their own right have their own fears, insecurities and aspirations that constrain them things that Koga himself knows and understands all too well.As Koga starts to gradually bond with the house’s inhabitants and help them overcome their problems Koga not just gains something that’s been lacking in his life due to his unique skill set which is that of friendship but also come to realize that despite not being full humans the inhabitants of the boarding house can be just as kind, thoughtful and helpful as they are and that their unique skill sets can become unexpectedly handy when the human’s come under threat from the many malevolent and wacky opponents that start to show up. Joining Koga in this comedy filled adventure are a host of characters that include the friendly but overactive Yuuna, the kind and honest Chisaki and the sharp-tongued but unexpectedly insecure Sagiri.KogarashiKogarashi voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Food Wars and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and a rare example of a psychic user that cannot just see and interact with spirits but also be able to banish them with his fist Kogarashi in the beginning of the series was shown to be a kind, caring and honest person that while homeless and poor in the beginning did not let this affect his outlook on life. A friendly, intelligent and joking person by nature Koga while unused to having friends at the beginning of the due to the side effects his abilities give him was shown to someone that was not just able to forge friendships easily but also someone that was noted to be very loyal to them and willing to do his utmost to help them overcome their problems no matter what problems it is. Unlike most psychic users that are able to interact with spirits Kogarashi is someone that can be said to be more open-minded than most as he prefers to judge spirits based on their actions rather than on their physical appearance and as a result prefers to first get to know the spirits as individuals and understand them rather than say banish them on sight as most other psychic users would have. This within the series is shown in how Kogarashi met and interacted with Yuuna and how he handled the demon that showed up during the seaside trip that his class went on. While someone that is seen to dislike the more militant aspects of psychic mediums Kogaraishi is shown to be someone that’s not afraid of using physical force if it meant that it can help protect his friends from harm. Despite the seemingly questionable nature of his role as a psychic Kogarashi is seen to be someone that’s proud of his abilities despite the great misfortune that this had subjected to his life too which is shown in his willingness to reveal his job to others and offering to use his skills to help those that are in need despite the ridicule that Kogarashi knows would result.As the series goes on and more of Kogarashi’s personality is revealed his personality gradually starts to change. While shown to be someone that had been blessed with the rather unusual ability of not just being a psychic user but also being one that was born with the ability to be a spirit medium it can be seen that Kogaraishi did not view this blessed ability with anything approaching joy. While happy that his ability enables him to be able to not just interact with spirits but also banish those that are shown to be of a visible danger to humans it can be seen that this ability is something of a double-edged sword to him as while useful it also had the rather unfortunate side effect of making Kogarashi’s life a literal hell as his status of a spirit medium meant that Kogaraishi often ended being possessed by various spirits whose vastly differing personalities caused him to undertake many actions that had the effect of causing him to be marked by society as a weirdo and ensured that Kogarashi had few of any friends prior to his arrival at the inn.However, while making his life hell its interesting to see that this past of his also created something of a silver lining for each of the spirits that possessed him despite leaving his body left behind the many innate skills that they had attained when they were alive skills that not just varied but also proved to be extremely useful to Kogarashi within the series as he protected his friends. The number and variety of skills that Kogarashi had as a result of the spirits I felt were interesting and impressive and I felt more than made up for his past. While shown to be a friendly person and someone that made his decision after giving it much thought it can be seen that this attitude of his changes when he sees his friends lives at stake and indeed in this state it can be seen that Kogarashi actually loses his calm and laid back attitude and instead adopt one that’s not just determined but also willing to fight hard to save and protect them even if it meant that do some questionable things like storm a palace almost single handily which is best shown in his rescue of Yuuna from the dragon gods palace.The character of Kogarashi I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his evolution from a quiet, friendly and laid-back person to one that was determined to make actual friends and protect them from harm with his unique abilities being especially well done. Given the hell that his abilities caused him I'm actually quite surprised that Koga not only resisted the urge to resent his powers but instead realize how useful it can be if it was used to calm and befriend spirits which is another thing that I admired about Kogarashi’s character. I felt that his voice actor Yuuki Ono did an excellent job of portraying the character of Kogarashi.YuunaYuuna voiced by new seiyuu Miyuri Shimabukuro is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Koga’s friends within the series. A ghost girl that Koga encounters early in the series after unknowingly renting the room that served as her home within the boarding house and thus making Yuuna his roommate. A curious, nervous but polite ghost Yuuna despite being a ghost is someone that comes off as something that’s different to what most people imagine ghosts to be as Yuuna far from being malevolent is actually someone that’s innocent, friendly and kind. As a result of both the fact that she’s a ghost and the fact that the boarding house that she calls her home has seen a massive decline in tenants Yuuna in the beginning of the series can be seen to be someone that was relatively lonely as she lacked any real opportunities to make any new friends. As a result of this upon meeting Koga Yuuna was seen to have become overjoyed at the thought that she will be able to forge a new friendship with someone new and as a result was able to forge an immediate friendship with Koga. This immediate bond of friendship that Yuuna forges with Koga was aided greatly by the fact that Koga was different to the other tenants of the inn in that while he was human he also had the unique ability to not only see and interact with spirits but also by the fact that he treats them with respect rather than simply banish them like many of their kind would. This curiosity to Koga and the fact that he defended her from an attack served to form a strong bond between the two that only grew stronger as the series went on. While a friendly and curious ghost that was seemingly carefree it can be seen that Yuuna was someone that was quite perceptive and was shown to be conscious of Koga’s attempts to help her attain her wish something that was both heartening to her and at the same time scary to her due to her inner conflicts that only increased as the series went on.Despite being a ghost, it can be seen that Yuuna still has a surprisingly number of things that and places that she wants to be able to do and see with some of them being quite normal like being able to go to school and going on a school trip with others and others being rather unique like having a sleepover and trading secrets with her fellow girls. This I felt was interesting as fulfilling these wishes for her actually allowed Koga and the others the opportunity to give Yuuna the school life that she wasn’t able to have due to her early demise.As the series goes on and as Yuuna gets to not just encounter and befriend Koga but also meet many other people her personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series while initially wary of Koga due to his abilities as a psychic this feeling of distrust gradually vanished due to the kindness that was shown to her by him and she became very loyal to Koga acting as both a constant companion to him and a valued friend. This bond with both Koga and the many tenants within the boarding house only served to deepen as the series went on and indeed by the latter points of the series the bonds that Yuuna had managed to forge with Koga and the tenants while allowing her to forge many new friendships also served to make her realize just how important such bonds were and causing her to become much more protective of her friends to the point that she will be willing to use herself as a means to protect them.While content to simply observe and accompany Koga in his daily activities in the beginning of the series this attitude of Yuuna gradually starts to change as she gets to bear witness to the efforts that Koga puts in to protect those dear to him from harm which had the effect of causing her to realize that unlike him she was clumsy, naïve and would do more harm than good if she tried to help. However rather than let these negative feelings affect her it can be said that this actually had the opposite effect as this prompted her to not just analyze her own strengths and weaknesses but also try to improve her skills and knowledge as she tries to be of better use to Koga. This I felt was interesting as it showed not just her determination to improve herself but also of her determination to be of better use to Koga someone that she grows increasingly fond off as the series goes on.ChisakiChisaki Miyazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Amanchu and Toji no Miko fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga’s classmates and friends within the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and the class idol within Koga’s class Chisaki from initial impressions were seen to be someone that was kind, honest and understanding of others and while appreciative of the fame and praise that comes from her classmates Chisaki doesn’t let this affect her core personality. Indeed, despite the fame Chisaki rather than being arrogant and prideful as some girls in her position will be is instead someone that’s friendly, honest, considerate and caring to all she meets and ensuring that she has no shortage of friends within the school. While an open minded and kind person by nature Chisaki is also shown to be someone that’s wary of outsiders and is someone that trusts slowly due to the number of people that would like to be her friend and as a result was shown to be quite wary of Koga at the beginning of the series.Indeed, Chisaki at the beginning like her fellow classmates while curious about Koga’s declaration that he was a psychic and had the ability to interact with spirits thought that it was just another attempt to make himself look more interesting to others. However, this later changed after Chisaki found herself the target of a malicious spirit that forced her to enlist the help of Koga despite the fact that she was still skeptical of his abilities. While the experience of seeing a spirit be not just revealed but convinced to stop their activities was an educational experience for Chisaki the unintended actions of Koga’s tag along spirit Yuuna caused Chisaki to have a rather bad first impression of Koga and saw him as a violent pervert much to Koga’s dismay. However, after seeing the way Koga resolved the situation with the spirit this attitude of her’s gradually starts to change.As the series goes on and as Chisaki begins to realize that Koga’s abilities weren’t just real but also that unknown to her and the general population creatures other than humans were coexisting with them. While understandably unnerved at this thought it can be seen that rather be frightened of this new revelation Chisaki due to her strong curiosity instead become more interested in this new world that was seemingly hidden from view as well as the various events that happen inside Koga’s world. While developing an intense interest into both the world and into Koga as the series goes on this also extends to Yuuna as well. Unlike most people her age Chisaki while scared of Yuuna at first due to the fact that she was a ghost gradually got over this fear as she interacted with her and realized that far from being a malevolent spirit Yuuna was someone that was very similar to her both in terms of age and life experiences and as a result become fast friends.This aspect of their bonding with each other within the series I felt was interesting as it proved to be an educational experience for both of them as they both sought to learn about each other and it was quite funny seeing the two converse with each other via messages. The character of Chisaki I felt was an interesting one and one that was developed quite well as the series went on. Her development from someone that while kind and caring was dismissive of things that she couldn’t see to one where she was more open-minded and more willing to believe in not just the abilities of others but also of the fact that in this world beings that she hasn’t seen before can indeed exist I felt was done well. I felt that her seiyuu Eri Suzuki did an excellent job of portraying the character of Chisaki.SagiriSagiri Ameno voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero and Comic Girls fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Koga’s friends within the series. A teenage girl and a Kunoichi of the Chuuma ninja army Sagiri at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was cold, direct and sharp-tongued and while a beautiful girl was widely seen as unapproachable by many within the school that she goes due to both her intimidating presence and also because of the fact that she sees all men as enemies due to her upbringing within a single gender school. As a result of this at the beginning of the series it’s perhaps unsurprising to see that Sagiri had a very antagonistic relationship with Koga as she believed that like all men Koga was nothing more than a beast that took advantage of vulnerable woman and as a result was not just protective of her fellow tenants but also showed a intense desire to fillet Koga with her kunai if she sees him do actions that she sees as suspicious which thanks to Yuuna is commonplace within the series.However, while someone that trusts others slowly and reacts brashly it can be seen that Sagiri is someone that has a firm sense of honor and is someone that both places a lot of trust in promises and someone that adheres to them no matter what kind of promises it was. In line with  Sagiri’s firm sense of honor is something that can be seen to be the core of her motivation as both a person and a woman which is her firm sense of justice and her loyalty to the role as a Kunoichi that maintains the peace between the human and spirit realms a role that Sagiri is seen to be very loyal to.As the series goes on and as Sagiri gets to not just encounter new situations but also meet many people that she never thought she will become friends with Sagiri’s personality gradually starts to change. From the onset of the series, it can be seen that Sagiri while very loyal to her role as a kunoichi of the Chuuma school was someone that actually placed an emphasis on the former and as such placed a higher emphasis on her role as a ninja than that of a woman. This, when combined with the fact that Sagiri was educated in a single gender school, meant that she was both unused to how to converse with boys her age and unaware of the effect that her figure and beauty had on them which had the unfortunate effect of making her dislike boys due to her series of misunderstandings. However, as the series goes on and Sagiri gets to not just partner up with her self-proclaimed enemy Koga but also understand the effects that she has on people this attitude of her’s gradually starts to change. In addition to her attitude towards boys becoming much softer and friendlier this change also had the unusual effect of awakening within Sagiri an inner fear of sorts where Sagiri develops a fear of the fact that she does not look feminine enough despite the fact that she’s seen as one of the most beautiful girls within the school. This act of insecurity only served to expand as a result of seeing the kind of figures that her friend Chisaki and her housemate Nonko had and awakened within Sagiri a strong desire to try and change herself physically by adopting a new change in wardrobe.This inner struggle of Sagiri’s I felt was interesting as it while it did a great job of contrasting between her default direct and brash personality it also showed an obvious character development of her that came about as a result of not bonding with Koga but also realizing that so far in life she has been keeping an unnecessary distance between people of other genders. While shown to be very loyal to her duties and her ninja school in the beginning as the series goes on and as Sagiri gradually starts to realize just how valuable friendship can be to her this loyalty is supplemented by her loyalty to her friends and indeed it can be seen that at this point Sagiri is willing to act against the interests of her duties if it meant that she can save her friends from a nasty situation a decision that the Sagiri of the past would have scoffed at which is best shown in the attempted rescue mission that she enacted to save Yuuna from the dragon god.The character of Sagiri I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her development from a cold, blunt and sharp-tongued girl that treated all men with suspicion to one that was not just friendlier but also more understanding of others feelings being especially well done. I felt that Sagiri’s development of the inner insecurity within her and her quest to become more feminine was used really well within the series to show not just her gradual realization of how attractive her figure was to others but also to indicate her growing feelings towards Koga. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sagiri.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were pretty well done with the characters designs doing a good job of reflecting the type of species that their true self was and the types of traits that they possessed. A good example of this within the series was Yaya’s default behavior and Nakai’s guise as an inn master that had dual personalities that differed from each other. Settings wise I thought the series made great use of a variety of terrain that did a great job of showing the kind of locations that can exist within the world. Of this, I felt that the dragon palace which was the home of the dragon god Genshiro was perhaps my favorite. While combat within the series wasn’t especially common given Koga’s determination to use diplomacy first and violence second I thought that the few fights that were within the series were well done with Koga and Sagiri’s fight with the stripping monster and the brief fight between Koga and Genshiro being notable ones.In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a great job of providing an effective soundtrack to the many wacky moments within the series. The series opening and ending themes which were Momoiro Typhoon that was sung by veteran singer Luna Haruna and Happen Kogarashi Ni Fukarete which was sung by Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki and Rie Takahashi in the guise of their characters I felt were both fun and catchy songs. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the voice cast did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main characters or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Yuuki Ono, Miyuri Shimabukuro, Eri Suzuki, and Rie Takahashi all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Kogarashi, Yuuna, Chisaki and Sagiri respectively. In addition, while I didn’t cover them within this review, I felt that Yui Ogura, Ai Kakuma, Sayaka Harada , Mikako Komatsu and Yoshimasa Hosoya all did an excellent job at portraying the supporting cast of Yaya, Nonko, Nakai, Oboro and Genshiro respectively.Overall conclusionOverall Yuragi Sou no Yuuna san was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, interesting characters, strong voice acting and its inclusion of fantasy creatures and supernatural elements into a typical school harem story. While the inclusion of supernatural elements like Yuuna and fantasy creatures like Oni’s, cat god vessels and Zashiki Warashi within the series was a welcome change from what we usually see within harem animes I felt these weren’t really used that well within the series due to their lack of character development which I felt was a shame. This was in contrast to the development that was given to the human characters of Sagiri and Chisaki who within the series I felt was developed pretty well with Sagiri, in particular, changing the most compared to how she was at the start of the series. The overall story of the series while funny wacky and featuring plenty of good examples of clothes shredding scenes I felt was too predictable and genetic and added little to make it stand out when compared to others within the genre. However, despite this, the story was not without its funny moments and these served to provide a great deal of entertainment to me as I watched the story unfold.Overall I felt that if Yuragi was given much better character development and some more unique scenarios that made use of the fantasy creatures then perhaps it might be more entertaining but as it is if you want an anime that’s funny, simple and ones that features plenty of clothes shredding moments then you should give Yuragi a try. As a final score, I would say Yuragi deserves a final score of 7/10."", 'Here goes another one of Studio Xebec\'s pathetic anime, after ""To Love Ru."" Frankly I really don\'t have much love for it, cu\'z nothing has changed with their brand of anime, and I\'d never understand why a lotta people around here got  a lotta helpful hits for an anime that basically a ""To Love Ru"" rip off, everything around here has ecchi and stupid guy getting into alotta trouble with his harem kinda thing, cu\'z this was more like a ""To Love Ru, Darkness"" where the main guy Fuyuzora Kogarashi was a Rito Yuki ripped off, whom just like the latter was just too...damned stupid to even say no to his harem as if he doesn\'t have the balls at all. Yunohana Yuuna a Lala/Momo ripped off, both love to sleep besides the guy both often get themselves being sexually groupe by the guy and both doesn\'t seems to do anything to avoid it, Miyazaki Chisaki is a Sajenjin ripped off, who seemly have the same level of personality, Fushiguro, Yaya was certainly the Celine ripped off around here, Ameno Sagiri, well there is no doubt that she was the combination of Nana and Yami all rolled into one, Arahabaki Nonko can be considered as the Ryoko Mikado of To Love Ru who serves as the quintessential MILF around here and Shintou Oboro , well she was more like modified version of Zastine, what about Chitose Nakai? well pretty much she is the Yuki Mikan around here. Now just hoe enjoyable was this anime????? Well I\'d say, it kinda look like that I wanna go to Japan seek out original creator  Miura Tadahiro and Xebec\'s studio executives and do what Sanzo of Saiyuki does to Goku when he\'s pissed, so my ratings:Story-Pathetic 1: It was a knock off of ""To Love Ru"" and just like it, it was just PATHETIC to the bone.Art-Very Good 8: Cu\'z it all about panties, boobs, and the guy who touches them girls and just wait a bit when the uncensored version come out.Sound-Fair 6: I like the opening song, and the rest, I have no comment.Character-Patchetic 1: Cu\'z It was just like watching another version of To Love Ru where the characters where just a ripped off from the said anime.Enjoyment-Poor 3: Like I\'ve said, I kinda wanna go to Japan and do some Saiyuki stuff  like when Sanzo is pisssed off at Goku to the original creator and the studio exec, due to me being pissed off with this thing.Overall-Patchetic 1: It was just like any other harem anime with ecchi stuffs, not worth anything, so anybody who thinks this should have a season 2 , should ought a________ themselves. damned stupid to even say no to his harem as if he doesn\'t have the balls at all.

(No offense...)Like I said, I enjoyed the series as much as I do."", 'I personally don\'t hate ecchi and harem anime, besides there are several times i usually enjoy them a lot and quite useful to fill my boredom, and this anime is one example, it\'s ""not good but also not that bad"" category because there are many flaws here but still quite enjoyable and it\'s still worth watching for harem anime fans out there or just want to fill your free time. First of all, i am not a type of person who like to review and judge an anime when it\'s still airing but this time i hardly must break it because i can\'t hold myself...to express my opinion about this anime after these episodes they offered.First is the story, let\'s be honest here, anybody who watch an ecchi-harem anime hardly thinking about a decent story right, this is the simplest premise of story this anime has: it\'s started with our mc (Kogarashi) moves to a cheap lodging where he meets a cute ghost (Yuuna) and promise to release her from the world by fullfill her wishes so she can rest in peace. The story premising is simple, but with 9 episodes aired already i\'ll be honest there is only slightly progress happen, only 1 or 2 episodes who probably focusing on it, we instead always got unlimited dose of ecchi moments where the mc always end up in bad situations either he got beaten up by other girls or being treated as a pervert entire time which is ALWAYS he never meant to do that in the first place, not mainstream enough? We also got one tsundere giri, a legal loli, a drunk onee-san, and cat girl, and oh a normal student girl (which all of them are basic formula of any harem anime). But before you got irritated, actually after some episodes later, the mc starts growing like a man and get better and most all the girls are getting tamed already by the mc who solve their each problems. The problem is the progress seems happen after episode 5 and later after that and pretty much the main story is just being a decoration here, which is understandable because ""plots"" are more important in this kind of anime. Now the characters, in my opinion most characters are boring and forgettable, until the point you can\'t care much about them and only care for the ""plots"", and in early episodes some of them are being so annoying, especially the tsundere ninja girl and heroine of this anime, Yuuna herself who keeps being the main factor of main character\'s misfortunes. The main character is so bland at first and always accept any misfortunes he got instead stand a chance to protect his pride (one of the most mainstream thing in harem), but later like i said he then start to gaining respect from them for what he did (being a cool and you\'ll get take down all the bit**es!). But the character design is top notch for me, all the characters are looking good even the main character which is a wise decision i think because it fits when he shows his cool moments sometimes. Another good thing they did pretty well so far is the fine animation which i don\'t really have problem from beginning, yes sometimes there are bland drawing but i don\'t have problem with it personally. The music and ost are average, the voice acting is not bad although some high pitching voices from the girls can irritate my ears sometimes, but rest of them are yeah, not that bad in my opinion. I probably going to update this review if in any case this anime could change my mind in the future either is gonna be a good one or a bad one, it depends on what they have to offer for the episodes left. to express my opinion about this anime after these episodes they offered.First is the story, let\'s be honest here, anybody who watch an ecchi-harem anime hardly thinking about a decent story right, this is the simplest premise of story this anime has: it\'s started with our mc (Kogarashi) moves to a cheap lodging where he meets a cute ghost (Yuuna) and promise to release her from the world by fullfill her wishes so she can rest in peace. The story premising is simple, but with 9 episodes aired already i\'ll be honest there is only slightly progress happen, only 1 or 2 episodes who probably focusing on it, we instead always got unlimited dose of ecchi moments where the mc always end up in bad situations either he got beaten up by other girls or being treated as a pervert entire time which is ALWAYS he never meant to do that in the first place, not mainstream enough? We also got one tsundere giri, a legal loli, a drunk onee-san, and cat girl, and oh a normal student girl (which all of them are basic formula of any harem anime). But before you got irritated, actually after some episodes later, the mc starts growing like a man and get better and most all the girls are getting tamed already by the mc who solve their each problems. The problem is the progress seems happen after episode 5 and later after that and pretty much the main story is just being a decoration here, which is understandable because ""plots"" are more important in this kind of anime. Now the characters, in my opinion most characters are boring and forgettable, until the point you can\'t care much about them and only care for the ""plots"", and in early episodes some of them are being so annoying, especially the tsundere ninja girl and heroine of this anime, Yuuna herself who keeps being the main factor of main character\'s misfortunes. The main character is so bland at first and always accept any misfortunes he got instead stand a chance to protect his pride (one of the most mainstream thing in harem), but later like i said he then start to gaining respect from them for what he did (being a cool and you\'ll get take down all the bit**es!). But the character design is top notch for me, all the characters are looking good even the main character which is a wise decision i think because it fits when he shows his cool moments sometimes. Another good thing they did pretty well so far is the fine animation which i don\'t really have problem from beginning, yes sometimes there are bland drawing but i don\'t have problem with it personally.

The sheer amount of absurdity in these kind of anime are preposterous. But hey, sometimes a cultured Scientist as I must conduct momentous scientific experiments and researches in order to cultivate and enlighten myself.Despite being spoiled on Youtube many times, this anime was still enjoyable to watch. And despite being a harem, I giggled and laughed, and had a lot of fun watching this show. The concept of ""ghost waifu"" is still intriguing and I\'ve loved it ever since I watched Dusk...Maiden. I\'m pretty sure that sole reason is the reason why I watched this show and enjoyed everything about it.Aside from ghost waifu, the Mc is also quite a gentleman despite inevitably having to do perverted things as he was born as a harem Mc. He\'s also OP, so it\'s pretty awesome to see OP mc and ghost waifu in the same show. By the time I knew both were present, I already knew that I\'m in for more than a treat.Good harem.

Gone are the days we sit back and just appreciate the show.The people who say the MC is generic, the art is nothing special, the ecchi is a bit cliche, and the story (if there even is one) is drab- I can\'t say they\'re completely wrong.However, no matter how overplayed a trope is or how ""unoriginal"" an anime can be, I like to think each title has a bit of its own special magic, and that\'s what contributes to our enjoyment. This show has that magic.The overall package just works together to...make it really enjoyable. I can sit back and no matter how ""terrible/cringe"" this show gets, I can enjoy it. The art style is delightful, the OP/ED gives it a memorable signature, and the harem is kawaii.But if you want a more objectified look at why I like this anime: the humor is funny, the girls are likable, well-designed, and well-written, and the story is simple yet not all too predictable. I can\'t dislike a show that has me chuckling and swooning.To end on a more neutral note, if you like comedy and ecchi, I can\'t see this anime faulting you. The supernatural theme is a nice touch and works. You can tell that even though they may have a smaller animation budget, love was put into character details and expressions. Give it a shot and you may just enjoy the kawaii within. make it really enjoyable. I can sit back and no matter how ""terrible/cringe"" this show gets, I can enjoy it.

But given this is a Shonen Jump anime, I had to check it out no matter what. Well now that we're at the end of the road with this show I gotta say I'm really glad I gave it a shot. Cause this one is a lot of fun. Made me laugh and smile tons of times.The cast makes this whole thing for me. This group of characters was a ton of fun. Kogarashi is a great lead, he's no pushover really and is a good guy at heart. He cares...and that matters a lot to me in a lead. Yuuna of course was my favorite of the girls, she's so sweet and precious it makes me want to hug and hug her and love her. She warmed my heart lots of times. Chisaki, Sagiri, and Yaya were other favorites. All the girls were great and all the side characters were a ton of fun.The writing may not be anything spectacular or new, but as I said I think this cast makes the show shine. The mostly episodic nature of the show was pretty fitting for that. I know the manga is the same way too. I think that style lends itself to letting the characters run things so to speak. The main overall plot isn't important right now. It's getting these characters comfortable with each other and with their surroundings. It was handled pretty well to me. I liked just about all the side adventures they went on.Only thing really negative I have to say about this show is maybe the animation isn't too good at times but really that's not too big a deal for me. Always preferred a great story over great animation. And maybe some of the gags didn't work all the time. But they were never awful or anything. Overall I really liked this show.

This really took off with To-Love-Ru, which has by far been the most popular of them, but Xebec have tried to capture that magic with a few other series since then. This feels like another entry in that list.Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san is for the most part a pretty standard harem series with a guy due to various circumstances living with various girls, with the somewhat...but not all that unique twist that most of them are involved with supernatural elements, with the supernatural elements here being related to popular Japanese mythology. It is not a very plot oriented series, wherein while there do seem to be a few overarching plot threads, they're the type of thing that are just there in the background that get nibbled on a bit here and there with progress on them not really feeling like that important of a factor. The focus more so is on smaller stories that are generally resolved in one, or even half an episode. Hence, what carries the story for series like this is it's characters and comedy.In terms of characters, for the most part they were a really solid bunch. The protagonist is legitimately really cool, wherein while he's an overtly nice guy that's easily flustered regarding girls as seems to be the standard for such protagonists, he is overall really competent in quite a lot of things and quite capable of dealing with any issues that may arise. Unfortunately, that's the type of personality that works best in serious situations and while what was there was pretty good, there weren't that many situations that allowed him to really shine yet. In terms of the various heroines, it felt like it had decent introductions to most of them, in that it showed their personality enough to clearly differentiate them from the others and provided a bit of background on where they're coming from. It really didn't provide enough to make it clear what their character arcs are or where they're going though, so ultimately they didn't feel fleshed out that well. It also felt like relationship development was kind of lacking for the most part. The exception to that was the main heroine Yuuna, who got much more solid development and feels like its more clear where her story was going, though it hasn't really actually really moved much yet. This is especially notable in that the anime starts with an in media res featuring Yuuna that the series never makes it back to.In terms of comedy, it was reasonably solid, but it started getting kind of repetitive at times in that most of it was simply Kogarashi getting caught up in ecchi situations, with the key word there being simply. Comedy centered entirely around ecchi situations can certainly be enough to carry a series, case in point To-Love-Ru that did something really similar, but there has to be a lot more variety to said situations and how the protagonist gets caught up in them. Here most of the situations felt too similar and it started getting kind of dull. With that said, there was definitely some comedy outside of that limited scope and that was quite good, but it felt like there needed to be either more of that or more variety in other areas.In terms of pacing it was really solid for the most part. Stories that felt like they should take longer took up an episode or more, while stories that felt like they should be resolved quickly were gotten through in half an episode. There were some strange elements to the structure however, in that the type of story that is usually used in the ending to anime like this where there things get serious for a bit and it actually feels like a climax, was actually in the middle of the series. And what the series actually ended on while a solid enough episode and one that was written as well as it could be as an ending to the season, is still pretty weak of an ending in that it isn't much of an ending but rather the story just stopping at a random point. The anime is following the manga and it wouldn't really be possible to reorder things, nor would it be possible to extend things without worsening the pacing, so it makes sense this occurred, but it does make the ending feel like it lacks the kind of impact an ending, even one just for a season, should.The art and animation as is generally the case for Xebec series of this nature, is excellent with a great art style. The character designs are also pretty solid all around. The soundtrack is pretty good, though nothing stood out as exceptional. The OP is really catchy, and sounds like old pop from a decade I'm too unfamiliar with older music to properly point out, with solid visuals.

Unfortunately that seems to be the main focus of the anime, but what do you expect- “hot springs” is literally in the title of the show, and they definitely waste no time showing just how perverted anime can get. In fact the plot pretty much exists just to have numerous opportunities to show off underaged girls’ skin; there’s not really any progression with the main character’s goal and the entire plot could’ve been changed without the actual anime being changed at all, since all you’re seeing the whole time is naked females. The characters are all stereotypical, common anime archetypes and the...“misconception clichés” that happen between them take an all time high in this anime; basically the accidental groping and seeing your housemates naked happens in literally every episode. And it gets old. You’ll come across these types of scenes once or twice in most anime but this anime is pretty much just a compilation of them. Because of that, it’s obviously steered towards a certain audience but it’s still too repetitive and becomes boring after about 3 episodes of it.This show is so focused on the fanservice that there’s nothing else really notable about it. Everything about it is average and the plot that could have had potential, had it been properly directed and executed, is completely drowned out by and excessive amount of boobs and butts. Literally every main female character in the show is depicted naked or half-naked at some point. Given the facts, I do understand that it’s an ecchi anime but I feel like there really was some potential with it that was ruined by the immoderate amount of fanservice. If they had focused more on plot and character development rather than just the characters’ exaggerated body parts then it would have been a lot more enjoyable. Even for someone who’s a fan of this stuff, I feel like it was too repetitive and predictable; there needed to be more diversity in the show.Somehow, however, despite not being a fan of ecchi myself, I found the series to be fun to watch when it wasn’t humiliating and stripping down high school girls. The baseline for the plot was interesting (and could have been great) and there were some times where the interactions between the characters were pretty funny. Although they don’t change at all throughout the show, the characters still all have strong personalities and are likable and the animation is fluent. Some of the comedy is actually pretty good, art is consistent, and the vibrant atmosphere of the show makes it easy to watch.Overall I’d say the anime is just average for fans of ecchi, considering that it does its job to bring you loads of fanservice but doesn’t stand out in any way among others of its genre; it’s just forgettable. If you don’t like ecchi, don’t watch this because it will probably soil your brain. Sticking to genres and types of anime that you like is the best option in this scenario because if you venture into harem/lewd/ecchi when you aren’t a fan of it, you will be sorely disappointed and most likely disgusted.

Our MC is so OP that the story arcs lose their tension and significance.2. Extremely high-pitched voice acting for the main heroine Yuuna and the inn-keeper. Caused actual physical pain to my ears.3. General perception of the supernatural within the world of the show. On one hand, you have the MC mocked for claiming to be a spiritual medium, on the other you have a complete acceptance of floating objects, etc.4.

Unfortunately, the show barely addresses this and as a result there’s no real plot. It’s a slice of life comedy based on the interactions between the Inn members and the eechi fanservice situations Kogarashi finds himself in.The comedy is terrible. I’m tired of all the...repetitive bed scenes where Yuuna is naked, Kogarashi ends up fumbling her, Yuuna starts blushing, misunderstands the situation and uses her polygermism to send him flying out the window. Like it wasn’t funny the first time and it pissed me off how how many times it was repeated each episode. It’s as if the writers lacks any variety besides cringey eechi scenes with girls misunderstanding the situation Kogarashi is placed in- because none of them have enough common sense to let him explain what happened. This brings me to my next point, there’s way too much fanserviceCharacters: 6The characters are one of the better parts of the show. The girls are distinct, likeable and memorable. However, they are cliche stereotypes that don’t have much character development throughout the season e.g. Sagari is your typical tsundere, Nonko is a alcoholic boob naked girl, Oboro is a bootleg Xenovia (from Highschool DxD) that wants Kogarashi’s babies. Kogarashi is your self-insert, bland MC with a shitty psychic power of punching hard. I swear, it annoys me when writer pulls the convenient deus ex machina ghost possession excuse for everything situation Kogarashi is in or to explain why he’s so good at something. It makes the story predictable because it happens so oftenAlso, it annoys me when the MC’s power is simple/basic compared to the supporting cast (coughs MHA) instead of something weak, but having them be creative with it. Best girl is Chisaki by a mile because she’s the only who feels more “real” and well rounded than the rest of the girls.Sounds: 7I like the opening song. It’s fun, upbeat, catchy and lighthearted like the show. The osts didn’t really stand out to me. However, I enjoyed the narrators voice for some reason.The animation is solid, like a 6-7/10 to me.Overall: 4-5Despite the criticisms I have with this show, I like Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs Inn.

Yes, this is what they consider to be humorous. Mixed with these constant screams, which would make medieval dungeon sound like...a theme park, are many gratuitous shots of tits and sexual innuendo which don't do anything to help progress the story other than invoke more screaming from everyone involved.Moronic characters aside, for whom thinking is a crime of greatest order, story itself is at the equal level of brain-dead with plot conveniences and endless amount of excuses to show more tits and asses. I know, it's ecchi, but at least some effort should be made to fit all that into something that resembles coherent story. The fact all of this is competently animated makes it even worse somehow.At this point, go watch hentai.

The typical story of a powerless protagonist to become a strong hero is overdone and things that happen throughout this story are standard to the plot of a rising hero.  There are parts where I was confused on contracts and such, but this comes more...from my dislike of reading contracts and how a contract could contradict another contract or how establishing a contract can make one null and void.  Reasons why I never will be a lawyer.Though I have said that the plot is of a typical rising hero, this common story help set a pacing that was perfect.  The rising hero storyline follows a rollercoaster of pacing, where it starts off slow and precedes to pick up as the main character learns new skills and eventually takes on the main antagonist.  One reason why this type of storyline is slow at the start is because of the pure focus on the main character, going from a weakling to a stronger hero, the pacing reflects that.  Witch Craft Works throws a wrench into that focus on the main hero as his teacher who is strong from the start helps with battles and fighting.  There are training scenes combined with scenes involving the teacher fighting that create a smooth pacing throughout the series.Art: 8The art in this anime was either super amazing or just super choppy.  Amazing parts include the animation of art and flying, the character designs as well as the designs for the minions and all the details put into the city.  Some choppy parts included a choppy 3D animation at the end, some fighting scenes, especially between minions, looked awkward as well as some explosions appeared to have missing frames.  The proportions for Kagari looks weird as well.. I mean anime with big-boobed characters look normal compared to Kagari... There is somethign about the way she is drawn that doesn\'t look quite right.The best thing about the art was the use of color.  Monochrome art is something that isn\'t seen too often but Witch Craft Works uses it exceedingly well.  Certain scenes just blew me away with all the hues and shades used of a color.Sound: 9The OP, ""divine intervention"" was a decent OP that reflected the fantasy aspect of a mages world.  The way it did this was through playing ""happy"" notes on a synthpad.  The combination of happiness and a synth helps give the idea that this is an anime that isn\'t a dark witch anime, but rather a bright sided one.  The ED is by far my favorite thing of this anime.  Witch Activity is super catchy, fast-paced song that sums up everything that the these villains are, evil, but not truly evil. The ED itself awarded this score of a 9, it\'s just something about the song that makes me play it on replay.The background music was lacking.  It did not ave enough impact for it to be memorable and never really helped carry a mood.Character: 9The characters that made this anime were the 5 Tower Witches you get introduced to in the first and second episode.  They are very similar to the Team Rocket trio in where they appear villainous only to become comedic jokes throughout the series.  The only difference is that there Tower Witches are more entertaining to watch than the Rocket trio.  The Witches are serious at parts so they have to be taken seriously at times, unlike the Rocket trio where they aren\'t taken seriously after episode 1.Character development... was lacking for the main characters.  The main character didn\'t really develop a new way of thinking but rather just gained information about the new world while Kagari didn\'t develop much besides giving more freedom to Takamiya.Enjoyment: 8With a story that is quite generic, I was surprised that I enjoyed this anime.  Most of my enjoyment came from scenes involving the Tower Witches but the main characters were also quite interesting to watch.Overall: 8Witch Craft Works was an anime that surprised me as I thought it would be quite a dark show.  I was assuming that it would involve mages killing mages constantly trying to protect the important things.  Though this is right, it was nowhere near as dark as I imagined it and I was glad to give this anime a shot. from my dislike of reading contracts and how a contract could contradict another contract or how establishing a contract can make one null and void.  Reasons why I never will be a lawyer.Though I have said that the plot is of a typical rising hero, this common story help set a pacing that was perfect.  The rising hero storyline follows a rollercoaster of pacing, where it starts off slow and precedes to pick up as the main character learns new skills and eventually takes on the main antagonist.  One reason why this type of storyline is slow at the start is because of the pure focus on the main character, going from a weakling to a stronger hero, the pacing reflects that.  Witch Craft Works throws a wrench into that focus on the main hero as his teacher who is strong from the start helps with battles and fighting.  There are training scenes combined with scenes involving the teacher fighting that create a smooth pacing throughout the series.Art: 8The art in this anime was either super amazing or just super choppy.  Amazing parts include the animation of art and flying, the character designs as well as the designs for the minions and all the details put into the city.  Some choppy parts included a choppy 3D animation at the end, some fighting scenes, especially between minions, looked awkward as well as some explosions appeared to have missing frames.  The proportions for Kagari looks weird as well.. I mean anime with big-boobed characters look normal compared to Kagari... There is somethign about the way she is drawn that doesn\'t look quite right.The best thing about the art was the use of color.  Monochrome art is something that isn\'t seen too often but Witch Craft Works uses it exceedingly well.  Certain scenes just blew me away with all the hues and shades used of a color.Sound: 9The OP, ""divine intervention"" was a decent OP that reflected the fantasy aspect of a mages world.  The way it did this was through playing ""happy"" notes on a synthpad.

Witch Craft Works is not much different, except it has magicians attending school alongside non-magical people. Our main protagonist, Takamiya, at first doesn't know about any of this. He just keeps to himself and avoids getting involved with people until the most popular girl, Kagari also known as Hime (princess), forcefully gets involved in his high school life. It turns out that Takamiya actually has vast magical potential hidden inside of him that evil witches want and would kill him to obtain, so Kagari (who is a witch) must protect him. And she does an excellent...job of protecting him considering she's an extremely overpowered magician with fire magic that can instantly obliterate half a city. Too bad her personality isn't as interesting as her magic, but oh well, it's still fun to watch her destroy stuff emotionlessly.The story in Witch Craft Works jumps around a lot. Each episode is very fast paced and the story is always moving in one way or another (whether it has any effect on the plot or not). This results in certain parts of the story being very entertaining, while others are just annoying and bizarre.The thing I dislike most about this series, though, is the first episode. I thought this series was going to be absolutely terrible after I watched it. It takes every high school anime cliche (popular girl, guy getting beaten up for being around her, transfer students, etc) to the annoying extreme. The bullying part was especially stupid (and why is one bully named Obama?) because it was portrayed in a humorous way, but it just made you feel bad for Takamiya. However, after the first episode, most of these aspects are forgotten and don't affect the story at all, so it's not too much of a problem overall.The character cast is a little too large for it's own good and tends to introduce unimportant characters as if they will be important. Takamiya and Kagari are really the only characters given proper introductions. These two are decent protagonists, but they don't bring anything new to plate. Kagari I found to be very boring both in every aspect aside from her overpowered magic abilities, and Takamiya is a generic protagonist who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. It also does a poor job of introducing some of the more important villains. The five initial comedic relief villains are just there for the hell of it since they do nothing except be funny and be in the ED. Another villain, Medusa (I'm sure you can easily guess what her powers are), is also just kind of there and doesn't do anything except make Takamiya develop more. Takamiya's younger sister who fights over him with Kagari is the only other memorable character. The rest are mostly unimportant or are introduced towards the end.The animation for this anime is actually it's best aspect. The action and aerial scenes are stunning and the CG really isn't too bad, and at times it's meant to look funny anyway. The character designs aren't the best, and I didn't care for Kagari's design, but they're certainly not bad. Some of the more magical scenes also look splendid with vivid colors and crazy designs. And the magic itself looks great, especially Kagari's overpowered fire magic. If you like fire a lot, you'll at least like one part of this show. The music is good with an excellent OP and a strange yet catchy ED. The soundtrack during the action sequences fits them very well but other than that not much stands out.Witch Craft Works is pretty average in my opinion. It looks great, but some of the story is just random and strange and the characters needed more time to develop with a smaller cast of actually relevant characters. Too many characters are introduced quickly late in the show and too many are introduced for too long in the beginning only to fade out of importance by the end. The final villain was especially terribly introduced, and the show made it seem like the villain was just a precursor villain for the real one except that that wasn't the case. Takamiya's power could have also used a better explanation, but I'm not sure even he knows exactly what his power is either. But even with all those problems, it's not a bad show and it was fairly entertaining. job of protecting him considering she's an extremely overpowered magician with fire magic that can instantly obliterate half a city.

Maybe it doesn’t in real life but it’s a phenomenal power of curiosity that exists in the world of Witch Craft Works. It’s not natural because people can’t just be born with it. However, it is like an essence that becomes infused with the show itself. For our normal male protagonist, Takamiya Honoka, his typical life will never be the same again after coming head to head with magic.As a series based on fantasy with supernatural elements, expect several attributes that defines this anime: magic, witchcraft, and competence. Well to be perfectly honest, Witch Craft Works shouldn’t be judged by its merits...of premise. There’s nothing distinctive about it. We have the normal boy, Takamiya Honoka who meets the idol (queen or princess as referred by others) at school known to many as Kagari Ayaka. Their meeting isn’t very normal with the circumstances after she reveals herself as a witch. It’s a trite formula used over and over in series similar to this.Witch Craft Works doesn’t escape a sea of cliches in any way. Rather, it classically defines it with its dull protagonist, Takamiya. There’s literally nothing special about the boy as many characters throughout the series sees him as the ‘average Joe’. On the other hand, we have a queen at school named Kagari Ayaka that serves as Takamiya’s antithesis. Almost everyone at school literally worships and tries to get on her good side. The show emphasizes the idea that she is their Goddesses while Takamiya is viewed as nothing more than a sidekick, or even a servant. Some may even think Takamiya blackmailed their ‘queen’ into being his friend/accomplice. And in essence, their relationship is monotonous. It isn’t just defined by their interactions or cheesy dialogues but rather by their lack of connection. There’s almost nothing compatible between the duo whether it’d be their traits, abilities, or status. More than anything, we only know that Kagari wishes to protect him with her life. Throughout the series, it does spark some curiosity as to what this may be. Otherwise, their relationship is about stone cold as a boulder lacking any features of enthrallment.In essence, Takamiya’s life now gets entangled with witches, magecraft, and a whole hoard of envious student unions. The story seems to focus on his life and what changes now from where it stands. On the surface, his life can be defined as a being in jeopardy now. This is because there’s a secret that lies within Takamiya that makes other witches want to hunt him down. Think of it as a ‘treasure hunt’. Takamiya is the treasure while the witches are the hunters. While it does focus on a cat-and-mouse style of formula on occasions, the hype quickly dies out. Most of the characters, or rather witches can hardly make an effort against Takamiya thanks to the presence of Kagari. It isn’t the fact that the witches are weak but rather Kagari who is abnormally strong. With a witch’s hat, armed with her magic wand, and fiery attitude, there’s almost nothing that can stop her from achieving her goal. Perhaps there is something that can stop her: Takamiya himself. If either of the duo are separated, it becomes a become problem for the duo as Takamiya would be unable to protect himself properly. This is where the clichés comes in involving other characters trying to separate the duo. When that happens, we get a black comedy level of violence. Surprisingly, it does feel serious with the mood characterized by the action. On the other hand, the results are often predictable because of various circumstances. What you likely expect is what you will get: the typical paradox of friendship conquers all.Perhaps the show isn’t necessarily colored entirely by friendship per se. Although the duo isn’t very compatible, there’s some romanticism going on. It’s not easy to notice in this series because the two main characters contrasts too much from each other. Because Kagari is often the one saving Takamiya, it’s also easy to notice that she is the senior of their relationship. Not only that but she holds authority at school and has a commanding presence. The good news is that the show doesn’t depict them as a master/slave relationship. The bad news is that their relationship lacks connection. It doesn’t characterizes itself as anything as sui generis. It’s quite obvious to see how much Kagari dedicates herself to protect Takamiya beyond her line of duty. Whether her attraction towards the young boy is romantic or not remains anonymous because they don’t connect in a way a normal couple should be. Furthermore, the series falls with the classic imouto, or otherwise ‘little sister’ trope involving Takamiya’s sister. It won’t take long for you to figure out that she holds some peculiar affections towards her brother. While it doesn’t necessarily go into an incestuous route, Takamiya’s sister resorts to violence to get what she wants. It defiles what an average family relationship should be while lengthening the gap between the siblings.Magic is prominent theme in the show because it defines the essence that the witches use throughout each episode. There’s no official class or order that gives ranks to any of the witches. Some of the witches are categorized by types. Yet most often, Kagari just takes the stage and presents the testament of her powers. This brings a problem involving the other witches with their characterization. Only a few of them gets moments to shine with back stories with the most obvious being Kagari. That aside, the action the witches perform throughout the show does offer some memorable moments. Spells are thrown in the air with passion and often envelops a fight with its mystical aura. The fantasy element is credible with the bizarre bunny knights, transformations, and even artistic bomb explosives. The premise also takes itself seriously with actual magical content and emphasis on Takamiya’s development in magical arts. Finally, Kagari can pull out some terrific performances from her hat thanks to her talent.Taken for granted, Witch Craft Works has the artistic style of a generic series. Takamiya looks normal, perhaps too normal to be defined as a distinctive character. There’s literally nothing that stands out about him in physical characteristics. Kagari is the one that stands out the most with her witches hat, outfit, and attitude. Thankfully, the witches can also be distinctive judged by their physical standards. Most of them are decorated with flamboyant outfits that actually make them look like witches. Even the creatures they summon can be fun to get used to by their nature. J.C. Staff handles the series’ production and plays out its theme correctly. However, there are some moments where the artistic style can be unfitting. In particular, there are usage of computer generated graphics during flight scenes of the backgrounds (i.e. buildings, cars, etc).Music and soundtrack is noticeable throughout the series. There’s a magical tone of its OST during scenes when mechanics of witchcraft is explained, most noticeably by Kagari. Soundtrack during action scenes is also consistent on most parts. Spells are also chanted that offers credibility of its themes with words that seems fitting. However, Takamiya once again becomes a problem that holds the characters’ cast back. His voice stands out as dull and annoying. His role throughout the series makes it hard to endure for his lazy attitude and distressing responses. Otherwise, music plays the more fun element of this show in particular with its comedic ED song. It transforms the idea of torture into a parody based on its sensational lyrics. The OST also has a mystical aura behind its tone that may draw you in to the show.An attempt to enjoy Witch Craft Works will be difficult if you dislike the main male protagonist, Takamiya. Even many characters in the series dislikes him for his normalcy and dullness. Also, expect the expected as most of the story will feel like a predictable trifle of what you may be used to for its generics. Do not expect major plot twists or deep characterization.

However, it's plot, thought it was suppose to be something that was exaggerated was turned into like rocket science where one could find it difficult as to the circumstances as to how the girl was linked to the boy and how the contract thingy works with the girl's madre who has the task of protecting the city. Also, there are a lot of conflicting situation as to distinguishing the difference between the antagonist and the protagonist even though this anime was meant to focus on the relationship between the girl and the boy.Sound: Ok, for the most part, I kinda like most of the voice actors who portrayed the character's in this anime, but the one who did Chronoire's voice, well I think it doesn't fit her given that in this anime she is a hundred something years old witch, where in my opinion she should have been given a more matured voice. Also, I don't like the opening song, but I do like the closing, WITCH, WITCH.Decent 4:Art: For the most part, everything was just too fancy, except the school uniform that them girls were wearing since I like its simplicity, but I got to hand it, this anime has no fanservice for the doggies to how about.Very Good 8:Character: Here, I admire Kagari for being this head strong girl who'd be willing to go to any extent to keep Honoka from harm, I also like the way that she acts as a mother figure to the guy, despite of the fact that she is suppose to be the guy's love interest.Honoka on one hand.......hummm, I do find him annoying at times, but I like the part that he has such integrity of not wanting to depend on Kagari and would rather see her safe that having to go to such effort of protecting him.As for the Ivory Quintet, well they do provide the comedy aspect of this anime and so as the guy's sister.Fair 6:Enjoyment: It was enjoyable, but understanding as to what is what and who is who about this anime makes look like rocket science even though this anime's genre was romance, magic, supernatural and action.Overall: It wasn't that bad, however, as to how's and what's in this anime basically lacks a more simplistic explanations, but still it's ok to such extent and I'm not saying anything anymore.

Adios chicos y chicas."", 'I could not wait to write a review for this garbage can.  I will eviscerate this pile of crap and hopefully you will avoid at all costs.  Unless of course you\'re a masochist.I\'ll get to the point.  The main character is one of the most pathetic, sniveling, whiny, weak, pieces of crap i have bore witness to.  Not once does he man up, and the only time he does something actually somewhat noble, he\'s crying throughout.  For example, one character is dying, all he has to do is kiss the character to ressurect the character.  He decided to snivel...and cry and whine for about 5 minutes.There\'s a point at which the pathetic-ness of a character reaches a point that you stop caring, usually i would have turned it off except I felt a payoff was due, i sat through over half of it, i was going to see it through, so why didn\'t i turn it off.There\'s a certain plot device in anime, movies, tv, that is meant to build the suspense and anxiety, this particular device makes me rage.  In WCW, it reached such an absurd point that my soul actually left my body.  Imagine having super powers, there is an evil villian that comes to your town, destroys everything, tortures your friends, and then kills everyone.  You would think that if you had a slight advantage you would take it and dispose of this person.In WCW, the villains come into town, devise evil, the main characters beat them up a little bit and then walk away leaving the villains half beat up.  Ofc they are villains, so naturally they go away and come back.  At what point should you expect the main characters to at least tie them up?  Nothing breaks immersion or even suspension of disbelief more than something so absurdly unbelieveable as letting the villains go.  I understand you might not want to kill them, i mean, they only killed everyone in town and destroyed everything.  Let them go.  The last episode of the trash bag, this probably happened about 10 times. In a row.  To the point where they would beat the villain up, turn around and start chatting to each other, and then the villain would get up right behind their backs and attack them again.  and everytime they did this, the attacks got more and more heinous until the villain actually killed both of them.  Oh, if it wasn\'t for love the heroes wouldn\'t have ressurected.  alas.So after the villain literally stabs the main character in the back, she regrets what she\'s done so she uses magic to heal the mc a little bit and then walks right out in front of like 20 of their friends.  And she just walks away and they have no intention of doing anything to her.  Their jails in this show get broken out of by everyone who gets put in them.  Literally, everyone that ever gets put in jail in this show breaks out immediately.  Seriously what is the point?  The villains basically shit all over everyone and they love it.  I mean this is an anime for extreme masochists.  Japan is doing a great job teaching this shit to people.How am i supposed to feel about this?  The protagonists were terrible to watch, the most uninteresting piles of crap i\'ve ever seen.  The ""villains"" were the only redeeming factor in this entire show.  AND NOBODY WON ANYTHING.  Nothing was resolved, none of it even made any sense.  All of it was avoidable.  Every single plan that the evil doers plotted was obviously preventable.  The show didn\'t hide it, they wanted you to know that.What was the story here?  MC has power, everyone tries to protect that power, everyone fails miserably, and then nothing happens.  I don\'t think i\'ve ever felt this enraged after a show before.  I hope you didn\'t read all of this, but if you did, the moral to this story is stay away unless you can enjoy the fake, lazy suspense that the MC\'s create by doing virtually nothing and acting so naive and unreasonable that you have to suspect this entire show was written ad hoc on the back of a bar coaster.Good night. and cry and whine for about 5 minutes.There\'s a point at which the pathetic-ness of a character reaches a point that you stop caring, usually i would have turned it off except I felt a payoff was due, i sat through over half of it, i was going to see it through, so why didn\'t i turn it off.There\'s a certain plot device in anime, movies, tv, that is meant to build the suspense and anxiety, this particular device makes me rage.  In WCW, it reached such an absurd point that my soul actually left my body.

I was kind of right in watching this show.Let me first start out with the plot.The story is not too bad. really. It\'s not, but it\'s not a gem either. To summarize... Some bountiful white bitch who refers to him as ""himesama"" or ""princess"" must protect him from this group of witches.. who have animal ears.. and stuff. That is pretty much the only distinction between them and the friendly witch group who is supposed to protect the main character.stuff happens, main...characters gets attacked, and the hime to the himesama saves the day once again. Woopdeedoo! Why should I care? Once again, we are not informed of this strong power inside of this main character person the evil witches are after until the last episode. It doesn\'t even enlighten you as to why there are two separate witch factions and why animal-ears faction is targeting the city. Which leaves you wondering ""what the fuck is going on right now?"" half way through the show.Also, just something I\'d like to note: Does this anime realize how many buildings were crushed or blown up throughout this series? Enough to warrant a declaration of a terrorist attack.Art:If I were to grade art and animation seperately then I\'d give art a 9 out of 10. The animation however.. is pretty inconsistent to be frank.Animation:The animation is really good.. in some instances anyway. One scene that comes to mind is at some point in the very first episode. You get to see Kagari (the hime to the himesama or just that one heroine in the show) do some Cuuuurraaaazy spins and flame wheel attacks with her broom. It was really nice, I liked it. It gave me hope for the show. But as the show went on, I noticed how lazy J.C. Staff was being. (JCS also did K-Project or K for short) K is a pretty good anime. Not gonna lie but god damn did they mess up the fight animations. They did these pregenerated attack sequences with some of the main characters and it just didn\'t look well at all and not to mention the still frames... Well, I can strongly say that WCW was a step up from that but it definitely varies.The monster (Giant rabbits and bears) animation looks GREAT I must say. I found myself really enjoying king kong one-on-one battles between two giant monsters (and its CG btw). It was very fluent and hilarious at times to see these wonderful scenes. However even though they did better with (some of) their fight scenes, the witch battles still varied from great to slightly average to still frames which I guess you could chock of to bad budget.The biggest offender of this that I can think of would have to be the second to last episode (without spoiling anything). There is a scene where heroine girl is fighting with the evil villain person-witch gal and it just goes into this 3rd person perspective of heroine gal for no goddly reason and basically she is just dodging all these explosions. It comes off as choppy and amateurish.So to summarize, in some aspects as impressed with JCS\'s improvements and in others I was pretty disappointed with their slip-ups.Sound:Pretty nice, however there is dat ED... There were so many times I would force myself to watch this brain tumor of a song. Words can not describe how much I despise it (not that\'s bad.. but good lord is it bad).I\'m not much of a musicoholic so can\'t say much else here. Hi.Character:Main character was kind of annoying, heroine was okay. All the sub characters are pretty dumb but some of them are quite interesting (Some). oh, and theres the yandere sister... Yahh. Also did not see any character development, the MC was a wuss through and through to the end. And the heroine was still just an overpowered silent hoe.Enjoyment:Despite some flaws in budget, story and character development it was still pretty enjoyable but nothing I\'d encourage for others to watch. But if you want to try it out, then go ahead. You won\'t be dissapointed but not so much awwed either.If you found my review helpful (or not) then leave a like or whatever you do on this site and also leave me feedback so I can know what not to do or do in reviews in the future (I am not a writer for god\'s sake!) :) characters gets attacked, and the hime to the himesama saves the day once again.

It contains a lot of cliches, standard anime stock characters, and has moments when 3D CGI is used to help stretch the animation budget. The 12 episodes cover a good bit of story but when the ride is over it feels a bit overwhelming as a whole, yet I highly enjoyed WCW. Is it because I expected this to be another run of the mill harem anime and turned out to be a quirky fantasy romance? That I can't truly say.What I can say about WCW is this: it's fun. While a...majority of characters are the usual recycled stock characters, they have enough spice to them to keep them all interesting and they all work extremely well together which is something that a few too many anime fails to work out. The animation excluding the meh CGI moments is incredibly good and one of my personal favorite touches for the anime was how colorful it was just to look at, but a good anime has to have more than a pretty face right?I mentioned that the story feels a bit underwhelming, after all while most loose ends are explained they are so quickly brushed aside and conflicts end up so easily resolved it often feels like everything leading up to it was just for flashy show rather than story substance. However at the same time it almost works to its advantage where in its 12 episode run it doesn't feel like there are any leftovers that would beckon for a second season. Setting out on what it wants to do and finishing by the final time the ED rings out is something a lot of one cour anime have trouble with.Overall, I have to say personally this was the surprise of the winter season for me. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did and found myself really loving all the characters in it and having a few good laughs along the way. WCW may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something familiar but different at the same time I would highly recommend WCW. majority of characters are the usual recycled stock characters, they have enough spice to them to keep them all interesting and they all work extremely well together which is something that a few too many anime fails to work out.

I was neither expecting to watch it, or even think that I would enjoy it once I actually started. Time, as it seems, has proven me wrong in both regards.Story: 6The story to WCW is simple and not very complex, and is by no means the strong suit to this magic-endowed action/comedy. However, it is paced well enough, and crafted well enough to get you drawn in to what might happen next.Art: 8...The artistic part to WCW is easily one of the noticeably better parts to this anime, with well-designed backgrounds, character designs, effects and 3D animated inserts that don't look like a kitten thrown in a lion's den. Most of the backgrounds are strikingly beautiful, while others are rather plain, but all of the art fits well and has a great color palate.Sound: 8Sound design, music and voice acting is another good point to this show. WCW puts its interesting OST to good use, and manages to accompany its scenes well without standing out too much. The voice acting I think could use some work with some of the minor characters, but overall the cast did a good performance, fitting in with the style of their characters fairly well.Character: 8Now to the characters. I really like the centric characters to this story, and while a few of them might not be very unique, I find them endearing. Expect for one, that is. My main beef with this show's character lists is how they handled the main character. For the most part, Takamiya felt like he was just a tool to advance the story, and there weren't very many times were I felt like he was actually doing something, which is rather disappointing considering he is the 'main' character. Alternatively, Kagari was a very good character. Serious to the point of being funny, she represents, in my mind, the core feeling of WCW and why I found it so enjoyable. Another favorite character of mine is Weekend, who is a good example of a weak-but-dangerous villain.Overall & Enjoyment: 8There are many elements that WCW does plenty well: Art, Sound and Characters are done better than the rest, if I say so myself. Fantastic backdrops and some good-quality artworks accents the odd and not very serious tone that the story creates, with sound adding on to the oddity that is Witch Craft Works. Overall, I found it to be a surprisingly enjoyable show. Serious humor (one of my favorite kinds) and the enjoyable ridiculousness of this show is something that I definitely ask of you to try.

The story, full of mystery and the unknown at first, progressed nicely for the first 8 episodes, then I lost track of who wanted what and had to ask my younger brother for clarification, which was a bit humbling. The series didn't have much variety to the humor...it brought to the episodes, but Kuraishi Tanpopo's karaoke was a blast to watch. The voice actress of Kuraishi, well chosen for her part, gave a sidesplitting performance. It was a scene that I watched again and again, and bolstered the ratings of Witch Craft Works.The artwork, and often the computer graphics integrated in the drawing cells was perhaps, maybe, arguably the best I've ever seen in the 30 years I've been watching anime. Of course, anime from the 80's and 90's can't hold a candle to the extravagant and lush and imaginative and fanciful, breathtaking visuals that anime studios bring us these days. The genre of this series must be fantasy. It surpasses even Paprika in terms of trippiness. I say that with a firm assertion. The lowest scores of Witch Craft come in the story and character departments. The big reveal of all this hustle bustle is that not only EVERYTHING comes back to what it was at the start, but EVERYONE also. That is, there's no ending, happy or sad. There's no development from the characters. Ayaka never had much in terms of personality. Her schtick is to be icy, detached, cold but blindly devoted to Takamiya for reasons that are hinted at to tease us, but never revealed. She's the one who stays the most normal during these episodic escapades, and frankly it suits her. It's Honoka that fails lamentably in growing, growing up, evolving any sort of emotion beyond hopelessness and mild stress and confusion. He never grows into the role he has been entrusted. Having frozen everybody's interactions and interface, the story makes everything go back to normal. THAT was hard to take. It was a case of Simpsonland.The type of magic used in Witch Craft is about bond and bartering. The bomb girl, Evermilion, a very annoying villain, seemed overpowered and her constant victories seem to undermine the invincible Ayaka. She even took out, seemingly, even Ayaka's powerful mother, who has been subtly and indirectly hyped up as the most powerful witch in that town.The type of magic used, is quite convenient, too much, and servile to the caprice of the story and is subject to the vagaries of the plot. Yet, the visuals are still at the service of the story, unlike most non anime and live action series I've seen. There has been quite some imagination spent into fleshing out this world. The worlds in between, the alternate dimensions are all memorable and intricate. There have been quite a few anime (cough, K, cough), that have put all their onus on the artwork and failed in all other respects. Witch Craft Works is an arresting series with a lot of heart, and I appreciated it very much, proof of which is reflected in my scores and this review.

For one i believe a lot of cliché situation were used on this serie as a method of comedy relief. Don`t get me wrong i really enjoyed the occasional joke and i laughed at this serie plenty of times myself, however i believe some of them were a little to obvious.The plot of this serie however I loved. I like how it was the...typical story (guy appears normal but has a secret power) but with a twist,putting focus not only to the main character but the situation around him, the witches.Art:The art in this serie was pretty good, simple but efficient not to mention that there were plenty of bright colours,well flowing action scenes and sceneries that were very enticing. I believe it lived up well to the standard of modern anime.sound:I love the opening to this serie, its fun, catchy and i think it matches the theme of this anime serie perfectly.

I feel like although quite a few clichés were used i do believe they were used with a twist, a way to make they slightly different from the rest. for example Kagari Ayaka I loved her SO much i thought she was funny and unpredictable, however in the end she just plays the emotionless character... but when it comes to takamiya kun her persona took an unexpected turn that made her so memorable.I do believe Takamiya kun could have had more of a background considering he was suppose to be the main character.... in the end i think i actually found him the least memorable.enjoyment:I really enjoyed this serie and i really hope there will be a season 2overall:its funny, has a good plot and i would definitely recommend it typical story (guy appears normal but has a secret power) but with a twist,putting focus not only to the main character but the situation around him, the witches.Art:The art in this serie was pretty good, simple but efficient not to mention that there were plenty of bright colours,well flowing action scenes and sceneries that were very enticing.

It didn't turn into a harem-like series like I originally though it was going to. The story is pretty unique in its own right, but I don't think it had enough time to develop fully or to its fullest being just 12 eps long. The characters mesh together very well, and there wasn't that traditional relationship that usually exists between the lead male and female characters within the plot. The animation was pretty superb. Overall, this series was very enjoyable and I hope to see a season 2!

Like seriously, who creates giant pink teddybears with a summoning spell?!Anyways the story and the characters are amazing! This anime is exactly what happens when you have a standard shonen/sword&sorcery anime, where you swap genders. To top it off, the boy who always needs the saving is even called Princess!It gets very funny and the fights are not bad either. I like how they are deliberately making fun of the ""enemy"" witches. Remember Team Rocket from Pokemon? Kinda like that. Other than that, the anime should likes to make fun of out little ""princess"". In your...typical ""damsel in distress"" story this time the boy is the one who needs the saving all the time.Kagura, the other main character, is your hero from your shonen manga, but yet again, gender-bent. She\'s strong, decisive and on-the-point. However, she does show her feminine side, often unexpectedly, which is also one of the things the anime relies on when making jokes. E.g. how she likes to pamper her boyfriends, or wear his shirt (which is super small on her because of her breasts by the way).The characters also have a normal high-school life though (bet you didn\'t expect that!). Kagura is the perfect example every girl should strive to be like on high school. The boy however is basically a nobody, a peasant. When he gets together with Kagura, everyone starts hating him, because ""it\'s not his place"". typical ""damsel in distress"" story this time the boy is the one who needs the saving all the time.Kagura, the other main character, is your hero from your shonen manga, but yet again, gender-bent. She\'s strong, decisive and on-the-point. However, she does show her feminine side, often unexpectedly, which is also one of the things the anime relies on when making jokes. E.g. how she likes to pamper her boyfriends, or wear his shirt (which is super small on her because of her breasts by the way).The characters also have a normal high-school life though (bet you didn\'t expect that!). Kagura is the perfect example every girl should strive to be like on high school. The boy however is basically a nobody, a peasant.

While a show on one hand can be one of the most intrinsically esoteric works Japan has put out in a decade, that doesn’t stop me from being aware that at times it becomes a narrative cluster brimming with melodrama. Meanwhile, I’m sure we all know a few certain films and series in this medium that are tearjerkers but when broken down logistically aren’t exactly that great. I think that we should love biases and embrace them, it’s what makes us individuals. This notion in my experience...on this site does not really exist.People slammed for liking or disliking something by those who feel differently with blind passion, death threats, just look at some comment sections of people who have disfavorable opinions yourself, folks. Most people will avoid these debates to preserve order out of fear, figuring out that that show you held up as a masterpiece or garbage may not be pinnacle of the industry and the worst of it respectively can lead some immature folks to a mental breakdown, but if we ignore our biases long enough to preserve this order, positions become cemented and people would rather kill each other than admit a flaw in their thinking.You’re probably wondering what any of this has to do with Witch Craft Works… well, that’s the reason you’re reading this review. O.o Witch Craft Works is for the first time in years, a show I’m confused about. A show I watched while airing and forgot about, but found myself enjoying it like sugar, a cheap treat but a treat nonetheless. Then came back a few years later and watched again. Still didn’t know what to think about it. And now, we’re both here, Dear Reader, because to this day - I’m still not aware. My best guess to figuring out my true opinion towards this show is to write it down, and you’re along for the ride - no false altruism here my friend, this is as much for you as it is for me. I don’t admit that? I’m a hypocrite. Let’s dive.The premise of Witch Craft Works itself isn’t as much as unique as it is simply an inversion of, or in many respects, an embracing of a common story we’ve seen again and again. Main plot revolves a highschooler named Takamiya, Honoka who lives life aloof at best, tortured at worst, this torture coming from resident popular girl in school; Kagari, Ayaka, who has legions of fangirls that crowd the very bus she walks on and, guess if this is literal or not - kiss the ground treads over.. Wondering if this little Divine Comedy will last for the rest of his time in highschool, he’s soon attacked by automatons out of nowhere during the day, this event leads to him discovering the person he despised was a fire witch from a group known as the: “Workshop.” Why is this all happening? Easy; the boy has a power in him locked-and-keyed away that can basically pull a joker-card on these what is revealed to be multiple factions of witches at war. Sounds pretty awesome? Well don’t get your hopes us.As cliche but cool of a premise this sounds, it will never go above and beyond any expectation you set for it and is content with the bare minimum, no more relevant and shown than in the main cast. Honoka is the typical damsel figure that must in some way shape or form be saved in every episode, while Kagari, being a tad more enjoyable, is a stoic type with a few kickass one-liners and a strong intimidation factor about her. While these two do indeed have chemistry together, I almost beg to differ with my own statement because in reality, it’s no more impressive than putting two random people on an island together and forcing them to cooperate, it’s less chemistry and more necessity. No matter how close these two get on screen, it never feels too real, like they’re still miles apart. Now whether this is a good or a bad thing or was intended narrative-wise I’m not sure myself, nevertheless, I can’t exactly call their relationship good, bad, but just enjoyable to watch for some odd reason not even I can pin down.What I can tell you is that the supporting cast, and everything about the show is far more lovely and inventive, in truth, I’d much rather see a show about our mini-antagonist, those being the enemy faction’s witch goons than anything Honoka and Kagari put out. Filled with quirks, cool cannon fodder in the form of robot… bunnies? It’s going to put a smile on your face sometime eventually no matter how hard you resist. Adding to that, some gags are pretty funny, hell, the ending theme are witches humorously being TORTURED ALIVE in chibi form.While I can say I was interested in where the main characters were going and how the plot would play out, especially in the last four episodes, I never for a second was interested in who they “really were”, as people and not charactactures with a slight gender-bending-twist.Despite having a bland cast the show finds a fairly symbiotic way to balance its compelling and beautifully animated as well as choreographed  action with this humor, very seldom did a joke fail to entertain me or make me giggle. Not even that, but the OST is designed to make you giddy as well, from the show’s opening: “Divine Intervention”, to some of the main themes by - . . . a composer that interestingly is not able to be found or pinned down. Don’t get me wrong, there is a sound director but there is no link I’ve been able to find to a composer. Huh, witchcraft indeed. Well, whoever this phantom-artist was they never ceased at doing an amazing jab enthralling me into the world. A few harmonic fairy-tale-arias here, to bombastic Final-Fantasy-esque orchestras when some challenging battles happen. I simply cannot agree when some have mentioned the OST to be lacking “impact” or memorability, it’s just attached to a show that is not memorable.And you caught my opinion on the show in that last line. Witch Craft Works is cute, charming, hilarious, entertaining, but it’s not concerned about what makes a show get everything right, something to remember it by - a great plot and cast. Nothing is truly accomplished by the end of its run and it’s as if the show just resets, almost feeling as if the adventure you just went on was pointless. . . but I still like it. In fact, I personally love and think it’s an accomplishment of 2d and 3d animation on a tv budget. The show itself is stunning. Can I really give it a pass because its plot, writing, and characters are dull and stiff as a board? I mean. . . sure. It’s what I like. Would I be “lying” to anyone reading this because I’m not sure if I can fully recommend it? If you interpret it that way I suppose, but I’m decently confident that despite it being empty by the end of this, you will not lose anything by watching it. It’s certainly a lovely side-venture in between or before tackling a show that you suspect will be amazing.I guess I have my answer, and you have yours. Witch Craft Work accomplishes being; a side-chick. Probably why only weirdos like me still remember and enjoy it, those who get trapped in little aesthetics and design along the way can look back on it with fond memories. Witch Craft Works isn’t as bad as it is passive and non-aggressive with the aspects of it that can be seen as bad. As much as I don’t like referencing original source material, I must admit that I am a fan of this show’s manga and my best guess is that the producers, knowing that they had too little a budget and too little chapters to adapt compromised and made the show mediocre with the manga’s best elements - that being its comedy, designs, and, once again, damn good action.Should you watch Witch Craft Work? I highly recommend it despite knowing it’s not a great, maybe not even a good show.. But let’s be glad that our world isn’t so black and white and there can be little shades of gray in between the lines.

Give it a shot, what do you really have to lose?', 'It`s somewhat rare nowadays that I stumble across an anime that isn`t based on some sort of manga, visual novel, video game, book, etc. Most anime of the late years have taken up this trend of creating an animation for ideas and plots that already exist.This is not to say that anything`s wrong with that. Anime, of course, is another way to create a larger fanbase of the original thing or idea the anime was created upon. Some anime are created which crash and burn compared to the original product, while others soar above the sales of what was originally being advertised. There are some...anime, or some gems, rather, which are looked over quite quickly, and never become as popular as they should. While these specific gems aren`t perfect, they aren`t incredibly terrible either. Not every gem is the shiniest or prettiest gem out there, but maybe, just maybe, it does have that extra sparkle or gleam which makes it so much better once investigated upon further.Witch Craft Works is one of these gems.~Witch Craft Works is about a high school student by the name of Honoka Takamiya, a rather regular character who is just passing by his life as quickly and as slowly as everyone else. The most popular girl in school, with great grades, great athletic ability, and great body, that goes by the name of Ayaka Kagari, is always by or near him, causing him discomfort as her raging fans constantly poke or prod at him, annoying Takamiya to no end. One day, Takamiya becomes the victim of a witch looking to steal his power, and she attacks him with her army of mechanical bunnies. Takamiya nearly succumbs to his death as a school building plummets towards him, but he saved by none other than the Fire Witch, and his pretty classmate, Ayaka Kagari. Takamiya acts as the `damsel in distress`, while Kagari is his `knight in shining armor`. The show is based around Kagari protecting her `princess`, as she calls Takamiya, and fighting other witches that are trying to steal Takamiya`s immense power within him. Together, Kagari is unstoppable because of Takamiya.The story itself is pretty original and enjoyable as it unfolds. While there are quite a few plot-holes plaguing the anime, and ideas which are never expanded upon, the regular high school setting with fantastical witches is pretty impressive. It`s not a show that you`ll get serious or dark themes from. It`s carefree, funny, and bright, and stays that way, even when the show gets a bit more intense. The anime usually sets itself up for complex and extensive concepts about the story, but it never takes the chance to grasp upon them. Witch Craft Works is usually much too busy focusing on other things within the anime.Speaking of things it focuses on, Witch Craft Works takes pride in its own animation. The show is absolutely gorgeous, whether it be during fight scenes, regular slice-of-life events, or comedic clips, this anime knows how to begin, transition, and end with its animation. The drawings and settings are completely breath-taking, and the designs for almost all of the characters are charmingly over-the-top and fitting with the story itself. Everything is a plethora of color, while not being too annoying or in your face about the color scheme. It`s bright and happy, and the art will most definitely not leave you disappointed.Witch Craft Works also takes special consideration in its soundtrack. The music fits very well with the anime itself, but there are only a few which particularly stand alone, and could be listened to on any given day while not watching the show. I thoroughly enjoyed the opening, in both the animation and the singing, but my favorite was the ending. The ED is so catchy and happy-go-lucky, nestling itself in with the mood of the show almost spot-on. I can almost guarantee that it will be stuck in your head for quite some time.While both the animation and sound are superb, the characters are a little worse for wear. While I really adore the gender role reversal of the `princess and her knight`, the trope is what`s really focused on in comparison to the characters. Takamiya is comparatively bland, as most damsels are, and his backstory isn`t actually worked on throughout the course of the anime. Kagari is at somewhat of the same downfall, considering she is just like the quiet and stoic type of character, showing her badassery quite often, but never revealing more than that. Sure, her past is looked upon, but it mostly has to do with Takamiya, and nothing else. I love the dynamic between the two mains, but while the rest of the characters look really cool, there`s nothing special or superb about them.~In the end, I really had to think about whether or not to give this anime a seven or an eight. Personally, I`m a bit biased on gender roles reversed, considering I absolutely love when they are performed and done correctly. Sure, Witch Craft Works did a pretty good job on it, but I know some people aren`t as happy with that sort of dynamic focus in the anime. If I were to compare this show to something, it would be like...... It was mostly like a shonen anime, but with all of the genders switched around. And no. Damn. Harem. (For the most part)Overall, while I loved every second of this happy, funny, optimistic show, the story just wasn’t all there. At the end of the day, it was just another anime with great potential that was never expanded upon. Sure, I loved it, but it`s not the best thing I’ve ever seen. If I were to recommend it, which I`m going to, I would say that it`s sort of like a `let`s take a break` anime. Something to watch in between intense anime or really lengthy anime. While I liked it, the only thing I can hope for is a second season, and character development.Final Score: 7.5/10 anime, or some gems, rather, which are looked over quite quickly, and never become as popular as they should.

While I liked it, the only thing I can hope for is a second season, and character development.Final Score: 7.5/10', 'I first encountered Witch Craft a few years back on a certain manga site. To my delight, last year it had an animation. It’s been my principle to NOT watch on-going shows, so I’m always late on what’s happening. You see, I just don’t like being left with cliff hangers. Anyway, let’s get on with my ever-so-late review.Story: 7With all honesty, I find Witch Craft’s plot very similar with a lot of seinen series out there. And when I mean similar, It’s your average hi-I’m-the-protagonist-who’s-a-normal-student-who-gets-joined-up-with-a-pretty-complicated-situation. Don’t get me wrong, though! It is not a bad thing. I mean, there are no two exact same things...in this world, except zubats and dugtrios in a cave. Kidding aside, like I’ve said before, Witch Craft’s plot isn’t that unique.The show is about witches, (thanks, Captain Obvious!) and Takamiya Honoka our princess—I mean our male MC. Takamiya is your regular high-school student who happens to sit and rides the same bus every single day with the most popular girl in his school Kagari Ayaka. One day, he takes out the trash from their room and disaster strikes our MC! Oh, don’t worry; it’s just a minor problem. It’s just a part of the school building… That’ll fall on his head. Of course, we wouldn’t want to end the show with just one episode and let Takamiya die. By unknown reasons, he was saved by Kagari Ayaka. And everything about his normal life will turn around because of this event. What will happen to Takamiya’s everyday regular life? Find out and watch it yourself.Art: 9Like I’ve said with all my previous reviews, we will rarely see unpleasant art these modern days. Back with Witch Craft’s; its art is nothing short of magnificent. Every bit is detailed, from the characters to the cute penguins, cats, rabbits, bears, snakes, which constantly appear background. Witch Craft’s art is respectable, period.Sound: 6Sound or music is a vital part of how good a series can be, too. From the special sound effects to the opening themes and closing themes, everything can be added up to judge how a series would turn to. As for Witch Craft’s, it’s sound effects during fight scenes were fine. What draws my attention was the ending theme done by the antagonist-esque five-women-group made titled, “Witch Activity”. Its upbeat tune made me gaga, and dance like a retard. Forget I said that. Anyway, the OP’s not that bad, either.Character: 8I like the way the characters turned out in the animation. When I first read the manga I thought that Kagari Ayaka was a guy. I mean, I wouldn’t even think she was a she if not for her big “plots”. Back to the animation, everyone had a stable role in the show; distinctive personality to match themselves and flawless picking of Seiyuu to voice them. The development of the characters weren’t that bad at all.It seems like Takamiya has a knack for being unconscious every episode and when he wakes up, he shouts Kagari-san almost always. It’s not that bad, though, considering it’s a light seinen (more like a shounen for me) series from the start and he seems like to possess every being and characteristic of an idjet MC.The blending from both the female MC and male MC is good, too. Although, I think they’ve been switched. With the entire cool-beauty aura surrounding Kagari and the feminine side of Takamiya who loves penguins. They complement each other well.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed Witch Craft Works a bit more than I should. It’s definitely one of the better shows I’ve seen so far. Everyone has a genre they prefer to watch. As for me, I am a fan of these kinds of show, so you can say I’m a bit biased here. I don’t want to sound overacting on how I liked the show and making your expectation of it high, so I’ll stop here.Overall: 8Overall, Witch Craft Works’ is not a superb show. But I’m not gonna deny its entertainment value. It was able to amuse me. And the other thing I liked about it was the light-hearted theme it possesses, unlike other dark-themed seinen shows out there. Tbh, I think it should be changed into a shounen rather than seinen. There are a lot of questions in need of answers, so I’m expecting a season two or some sort of sequel to it. All in all, Witch Craft Works is not a bad show. It won’t blow you off like other big-time series out there, but it’ll definitely pique your interest. in this world, except zubats and dugtrios in a cave.

They complement each other well.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed Witch Craft Works a bit more than I should. It’s definitely one of the better shows I’ve seen so far. Everyone has a genre they prefer to watch. As for me, I am a fan of these kinds of show, so you can say I’m a bit biased here. I don’t want to sound overacting on how I liked the show and making your expectation of it high, so I’ll stop here.Overall: 8Overall, Witch Craft Works’ is not a superb show. But I’m not gonna deny its entertainment value. It was able to amuse me. And the other thing I liked about it was the light-hearted theme it possesses, unlike other dark-themed seinen shows out there. Tbh, I think it should be changed into a shounen rather than seinen. There are a lot of questions in need of answers, so I’m expecting a season two or some sort of sequel to it. All in all, Witch Craft Works is not a bad show. It won’t blow you off like other big-time series out there, but it’ll definitely pique your interest.', 'First of all, its not for everyone.I read other peoples feelings here and concluded the most obvious thing:People see shows in such different ways that its super hard do please.I like this show, and i rewatched, and im kind of hard to please if i say so. But something in this show, the time comic idk, it makes me feel at easy.Its not a show to be high on, or to remember forever, dont get me wrong. But im not bored watching it, and thats remarcable nowadays. I think this come from the peace it gives me, the comic time and how good the design...and animation works on. Its a easy show to watch, not so strong mixed feelings, ansiaty triggers and etc. Its good, funny, heart warming and easy to watch. If ure having a hard time or anything, i sugest watching. Give it a go, watch some ep and dont get too much expectations on anything, just relax. and animation works on.

It\'s about a loser guy being protected bu the popular girl, sure a little bit of romance was felt but, that wasn\'t the focus of this show.Art = 7 - the art was good, fight scenes were animated nicely.Sound = 8 - the OP was good but, the ED was sooo cute!Character = 7Takamiya-kun - the MC, he is so moe! He is so cute that it makes want to...eat him up. He isn\'t like other MCs who are pathetic and useless, he actually wants to help but, Kagari-san is very over-protective.Kagari-san - her boobs are so big! It\'s unfair. Anyway, she\'s cold, like a robot. I have never seen her smile in this show. She is very over-protective towards Takamiya-kun.Kasumi-chan - bro-con who can control and enlarge teddy bears.Medusa - you can\'t have a witch-type anime without Medusa raising shit up.Weekend - the ""main antagonist"", a bomber witch.Enjoyment = 7 - It\'s really fun to see how Kagari-san treats Takamiya-kun, it\'s obvious she wears the pants in their relationship. The tower witches, who you think are evil, cunning are actually just a bunch of idiots and the way they are defeated is funny.Overall = 7 - It\'s just an anime about Witch VS Witch, magic battles, flying on brooms, drawing power from someone or something else, no new elements. But how the Tower Witches get defeated and sent flying reminds me of Team Rocket. eat him up.

In fact, they played around with their boundaries, breathed new life into them and all the while told a pretty good story along the way.However, I truly think this show could have benefited from a few more episodes to allow for more development and storytelling, but I think it did well for the small period it had to cover...everything. Very little was left unexplained but the full background to Kagari and Takimaya\'s relationship was cut short and never finished which is rather disappointing. But I also have to commend them for not basing this on the obvious romance that could have erupted between the two main characters, but rather the bond/contract they share and how they have to grow with one another rather than simply being together.Story: 7As I said before, there\'s a few cliches, but overall it\'s enjoyable. It can feel rushed because they want to get all the big points put into 12 episodes, but if you can look past that little detail then watching this series is a breeze.Art: 6All the art seemed so average to me. Nothing too special, but not particularly bad either. Even my mom commented on the graphics being ""lame"" when she saw what I was watching. And that\'s all there is to it - the graphic didn\'t wow me or dazzle me and were just... there. Evermillion, Kagari in full-fledged Fire Witch form and the intricacy of the development of the tattoos on Kagari/Takimaya that would form are the only things that were moderately stunning.Sound: 8It was good, well placed and never overpowering.Character: 6There could have been a little more development in this area. The fact that the tower witches motives were purposefully left so vague worked out at first, but I think individual characters should have made their motives known. I mean, if all of these witches knew about Takimaya then why are they finally attacking now? This is also a failed plot point.Beyond that, I do like how they made it seem like Kagari was carefree (which mostly came off as lack of emotion), but would periodically reveal something that showed otherwise through flashbacks and small breaks. Also Kagari and Takimaya are phenomenal foils of each other that meet on certain levels; her lack of emotion is countered by his deep caring and emotional desires to keep everyone safe and their recklessness, for various reasons, show their similarities.Each witch from their respective side managed to have their own distinct personality and most showed why they were on their particular side.Enjoyment: 9The overall enjoyment of the series is definitely high. At times, the show was extremely cute and at others it kept me engaged in the fights as I wondered how Kagari could do all she did and walk out just fine. And really, the characters were all pretty likable in their own right.I would definitely recommend this anime.

Why does every anime hold kisses on such a grand level like they are about to get married? Most of the show was good but the last episode really annoyed me. Someone that you have feelings for died for you, and they add kind of a comedic part, of him joking around about how embarrassing it is to kiss someone. I guess i might understand a little if he was too embarrassed...to do it in a normal situation but for him to think like that when someone is about to die is absurd.Besides that part, i think the story was good. There are many animes that are so similar that you couldn\'t tell them apart if they had the same name, but there very few anime that use the ""older girl"" type feeling. Also the story, and the direction  it went was a little different from most as well. Many might complain that no one died, but this is a lighthearted type story, and it would make the story too dark if someone really did die. Even the villains on the show did not give off such  a dark vibe.If I could add something to the show, i wish the show could have been longer, and it would have been kind of cool to see the MC learning how to fight on his own. At first i thought that was going to happen when he asked her to train him, but in the end she was too protective of him to train him other than teaching him how to run away if something went wrong.If someone asked me if they should watch the show, i would say it depends on what they are looking for. If they are looking for a full on romance, or a combat type show, i would not recommend it because in the end they never really are together.

This is until she becomes talkative to him after his life nearly ends as it turns out she is a witch. The Workshop Witches and the Tower Witches whom both have goals of either peace or careless destruction to gain what they want are after the main protagonist since he is effectively possessed with great power.The story has many tropes we like to see with this being unusual as the male is more or less helpless with the powerful...female cast.The story plays out with the now sort of couple being attacked and defeating those who wish harm on them. Some fights are easier than others and many accept terms when facing defeat to live somewhat peacefully.It all reaches a climax in this series which is somehow not categorised as a comedy when it is funny and random at times. Seeing a Churchill tank just sat in the school as people go about their business for example. This is not a Girls und Panzer spin off.ART:The art style used is very good when down on the ground. When going for large scale conflict that involves giant teddies or whatever battling the quality of the surrounding does drop to almost cut and paste buildings. This however is absolute fine as it stops the eyes from looking away from where they should be.The characters are all very well done with a lot of cute girls in clear style of tropes. Even if it is odd to see girls with real cat ears on their heads but also human ears, it is nevertheless very cute.SOUND:The OP is pretty standard of the industry for a generic opening sequence which admittedly has some drops of quality. The ED however is a very fun style to hear especially when combined with the animation of the girls of the KMM gang in a torture like scenario.The general sound used throughout is fitting and well balanced with the music being played.The voices of the characters are well chosen. (I watched in Japanese with English subtitles). When a girl who looks like she should have a cute voice does have one it is nice to see.CHARACTER:Our main two protagonists Kagari, Ayaka and Takamiya, Honoka are nicely done through the series with plenty of development. Where in this case Honoka is the weaker male he is some what innocent in many actions especially with his fear to kiss Ayaka on the lips.The little sister Takamiya, Kasumi is a very enjoyable Bro-Con to watch, which is made so by how she denies being one even though everyone can see it and her habits of sharing the bed with him and the admission of being his future wife and having three children together.The KMM gang are a nice addition to getting a good amount of screen time as they bring a lot to the party. They fill various tropes with Kuraishi, Tanpopo being my favourite in that she has a sort of anger about her even though she is just a normal girl at the end of the day.The rest of the characters are slotted in very well and you can be surprised at times who suddenly turns out to be a witch unexpectedly.ENJOYMENT:The show is very enjoyable to have watched with many moments of humour. The random placement of things around like mentioned can allow hilarity to ensue. The story also is somewhat serious whilst maintaining in a light-hearted way too. The characters really do make this show for when it is serious it is serious but when it changes it can be sudden and unexpected.In Episode 12 in the first half is an absolute epic moment made by the music.OVERALL:In the end this is a show that is absolutely worth its score. It is funny, serious, emotional and just fun to watch. I watched it from start to finish in a day because I just could not stop watching. It is sad that it does end, however. The manga is on my list to read because it is supposed to be even better.

Witch Craft Works takes an almost episodic structure and the only thing that ties the show together chronologically is the progression of the characters.And I’m completely okay with that as this show had a large and great cast of characters. The thing that made this show so enjoyable for me was how goofy everyone was. It was very much like...The Devil is a Part-Timer!Where the characters would normally be taken seriously but instead they are not. Often times these characters feel like actors in a play. Once their scene of fighting is over everyone is friends even living in the same house.There are a few episodes of plot that take two episodes to resolve but these are few. Any of the drama, action, and suspense this show could have had was removed in lieu of the romance. Which normally I would be alright with, however, that romance had no payoff. If you’re going to remove many of your possible aspects to focus on one thing in particular than whatever you focus on should be damn good. Sadly by the end of Witch Craft Works our wonderful main characters are exactly where they were in the first couple episodes. We just simply understand them better.I should add this show is getting an OVA in July. When that airs it is possible to change my opinion of the show. However, for now this show is one with high enjoyment but absolutely no payoff, so most of that enjoyment is ruined in the end.

I watched this show because I remember reading the manga and liking it, but now that I think about it, I can’t recall what happened in that manga at all.Pros:- The art and animation. There’s a lot of beautiful scenery and background, especially in the latter half of the show, and there is good animation as well, the magic, certain battles, as well as many flying scenes. There is some CGI but I don’t think it detracts from the show at all and is fairly well done.Mixed:- Our...main duo. Takamiya and Kagari do make for a pretty cute pair, the damsel in distress and his knight respectively if you were to simplify it. Plot spoilers aside, you’re set up well to be invested in them, both their relationship as well as who they are individually. I do think the pacing knocks them down a peg unfortunately, as there are a lot of hints to things that go nowhere. Both of their characters suffer too as a result, they honestly just take turns being damsels, but at least Kagari responds with actually doing something about it, while Takamiya just panics and waits for someone else to tell him what to do.Cons:- The characters. Theres an awful lot of people to get to know in the span of 12 episodes, so unfortunately basically everyone outside of our main duo is severely underdeveloped. There’s a Team Rocket esque group that the duo deals with through the entire show and only 1 of them is memorable, and I’d argue it’s only because she had a special individual fight scene before the rest show up, there’s nothing I could tell you about the other 4 members of the group that you couldn’t glean from character design, I’m pretty sure only 2 of them show off their magic too. Multiple characters will show up, stick around and act like they’re well established, and then vanish after like, 2 episodes. The school as an entirety sucks too, they’re there to be assholes and that’s about it, there’s few to no consequences for them, nor do they change either.- Kasumi. Unfortunately they decided to add the trope of incestuous little sister and clueless big brother to this show, as Takamiya’s little sister Kasumi is deeply obsessed with him and wants to get married, but also she doesn’t realize she’s being incestuous, it’s just normal sisterly feelings! Ugh. It’s a shame because she’s got an interesting setup, but they kinda toss it out halfway through and turn her into either a background character or a creep.- The pacing. The show whiplashes between school shenanigans and witch related conflicts, handwaves plot holes, and doesn’t give enough time for anything to be set up or sink in. Fights are either short or aren’t shown, either Kagari immediately kicks ass or gets her ass kicked, sometimes even offscreen. I ended the season not really having a grasp on anything, and a lot of stuff is left unresolved. It feels like they either knew they weren’t getting another season or they were hoping they would, and you can’t tell which one it was.- The worldbuilding. You enter the show curious to learn more about the conflict between the Workshop Witches and the Tower Witches, why Takamiya is stuck in the middle of the two, and how the magic system works. The anime doesn’t go past surface level regarding any of those topics, or plops things in with no explanation, resulting in a frustratingly underdeveloped world.Ultimately I’m not sure how to feel about this show, part of me wants to like it considering that it’s a point of nostalgia, but it’s hard to argue why this show is worth watching.

I usually refrain from breaking down the animation into categories, but they were abnormally different from each other here, so...The plot is horrible. Just a heap of shonen cliches more than a plot, really. So story/action elements/battles/plot are certainly not what you'll want to focus here.Art is mediocricity incarnate, and with main heroine being a cool beaty never changing facial expressions and her girlfriend, the protagonist, being a bitch that has permament teary eyes, I doubt animators in charge of drawing facial expressions overworked themselves too much.Music is... ok. It's a typical mashup of pop and emotional AngelThesis-que bullshit. so,...yeah, music isn't the cherry on this questionably delicious pie.buuuut... that's right. Character. The saving grace of this shitty anime, and although main cast of strong girl and her sissy boy that licks her feet before bedtime is somehow refreshing in shonen genre, what really shines are secondary characters, all of which are interesting enough that I wished they'd elaborate somewhat about their background instead of introducing another *bullshit villain that turns into ally* (puke from shonen gibberish overload).overall it was enjoyable enough that  I didn't regret watching it, but if I were you, pondering whether to give this series a shot, I'd pass it up. While it wasn't bad, it most certainly wasn't good either, good enough to justify all the time it'll cost you to watch through it. yeah, music isn't the cherry on this questionably delicious pie.buuuut... that's right.

The series also relies a little too much on the whole, ""we\'re going to hide things about everyone\'s past to make stuff seem mysterious and dramatic"" to create suspense, instead of doing it with good storytelling.That being said, the character designs in this series are awesome. Nearly every character (except for the two MCs, really) are imaginative and fun, which brings a lot to the...enjoyment factor of the series. The animated fights are also done very well -- I actually kinda liked the use of CGI in Witch Craft Works.

The result? This thing. Is it good? No. It is enjoyable nonetheless? Sure. It's a pretty shallow rom-com.For what it's worth, the artwork is very polished. I can tell that a lot of work has been put into making the characters look attractive. Having said that, the actual designs are pretty generic and unimaginative. Furthermore, the series often makes some bizarre choices in terms of color hue. The color palette just looks weird at times.Regardless, all in all, it's a good looking show, but I would argue it's below J.C.Staff's average....The animation is really stiff and it relies heavily on CG. That being said, it was fairly good CG. It did not bother me as much as I would've expected. Still, I would have expected better from the studio that brought us Bakuman, Toradora, Sakurasou, Toaru, and many more.Anyway, if this sounds like something you'd like, then go ahead and kill some time.

I don\'t want to make it boring as the anime is. Contains some spoilers and swear words, so if you want to avoid one of these things stop reading it now. One more thing, be aware of that English is not my first language. ;)Story (4): Pretty casual story. Main male character is a ""container"" who possesses hidden magic powers. Both the Workshop Witches and the Tower Witches want him. The first are trying to catch him, when the other one are trying to protect him. Simple as that. (If you want to know...more read a synopsis or watch it yourself.) It seems like a plot is not really important and have changed few times during the show. I mean, the anime could be shorter if we cut some useless things like - let\'s call it side, because I don\'t have any better word for that - side story where Kagari was about to learn this moron Takamiya some magic. It took them so long to even start. When she was finally attempting to teach him, he got hurt while ""learning"" and she needed to stop. Really? That\'s it? He was talking some much that he needs to protect her... Blah, blah, blah... And it finished faster than it started.Art (6): The anime art is alright. I\'ve seen some better and worse visuals. I have almost nothing to say against it, except moments where a 3D animations were used. It creates massive contrast between objects animated with a classic ""drawn"" way and a computer animated objects, destroys immersion and of course looks bad.Sound (8): I\'m sure that a sound is the best thing in this anime, especially the ending, which is really catchy. There is nothing more I can argue about.Characters (5): Here we go... That is the first anime where the main characters are so annoying. The male mc is a pussy and crybaby, what can I say more. He is just useless. There are two or three episodes, where he actually did something. I hate this type of MC... The female MC, his nanny. Overpowered, emotionless princess. And... That\'s it. Are you surprised? No need for that. She is not interesting whatsoever. The only good thing about her is some ""comedy"" aspects that happened and of course are related to relationship, between herself and the male MC.  If I would give a score based on these two I would give one point. What saves this anime are supporting characters. They were just lovely. I\'m mostly talking about this small group of Tower Witches who used to live in MC\'s house, but the other were great too.Enjoyment (4): Due to that the story doesn\'t add up and main characters were hard to swallow, it was really hard for me to finish this anime. It took me around month to do this. Which is quite an achievement, because that have never happened to me to watch an 12 episode anime so long.Overall (5): A comedy bits were funny and were making me smile and even sometimes giggle.

Originally he laments about having to sit next to her in class which makes him both envied and ignored.  Then one day he is attacked by a girl who is a witch and Kagari swoops in to save him revealing that she also is a witch.

Its wacky, funny, the art is well done and I liked the music. However the story and the characters are where this anime gets a little rocky. Now I haven\'t read the manga or any other adaptation so this is only for the anime.The story starts off with the male main character Takamiya, Honoka being beaten up for dropping his eraser and having the school ""princess"" pick it up for him. This is where they introduce roughly the idea that the whole school...loves the female main character Kagari, Ayaka. We go on to find out that Ayaka is also a witch who protects Honoka from dangers, which now are mainly the evil witches who are after him.This is actually kinda interesting to me. Cute girls, funny cheeky combat, and the show doesn\'t take itself too seriously. The problem with this however is that there is some really interesting back story that never really gets explored and by the end of it that made the score take a big hit. The story starts slow, things happen in almost a slice of life pace. However the pacing picks up towards the middle and they don\'t take the viewer along. They constantly hint that the story and the answers to fully enjoy the show will be given sometime but it never truly comes. The last two or three episodes of the anime answer some questions however raise just as many as they answer. This wouldn\'t have been a problem if they kept to their slice of like pacing and story telling but eventually the story turned into a more serious one and the viewer was given no knowledge to propel themselves into the later episodes.The characters were actually pretty well done, though the depth that people usually look for in characters isn\'t really their either. Each character had a part to play in the story and revolved around the male MC. However do to the sporadic story telling of the show we only find out some bits of information about certain characters but overall their isn\'t any sit down and learn about their past episode which was fine. My biggest issue with the characters was Honoka. He was playing the weak character role and played it well. At first I thought this was going to be more spoofy, as the first time Ayaka saves him she calls him her princess. This however was wrong, he constantly stops the progress of the story to constantly interject his weakness. This becomes repetitive and annoying after awhile.The art and sound were actually really well done. I love anime art and honestly I cant put my finger on why. This doesn\'t strike me like SHAFT does but its very well done. The environment and the characters are all done really well. They use a lot of vibrant colors and add a lot of things that draws attention like floating orbs or ear and teeth that allow for some interesting visuals. The music was catchy and I can see myself adding it to a Youtube playlist.Overall this anime was actually pretty entertaining. The reason it gets a six is that I don\'t think I will ever watch it again. It was hard for me to get past Honoka constantly being super weak. It was also hard to follow the story and I know if I watch it again I will only be left with the same amount of questions.

It has a bevy of diverse characters and an interesting story. The world they live in is well throughout, the action is spectacular and the art is gorgeous. Despite a near all female cast, the show is chaste and modest. I even liked the fact that Honoka Takamiya needs to be rescued by Ayaka Kagari.<sigh> So many anime cliches that irk me. First is Ayaka's character design, which I understand. She's suppose to be the super smart and beautiful idol of their school; so her figure is designed...with giant boobs.

Also scoby syndrome a.k.a. characters who are tantamount to useless. 13 characters: two are our main characters, two are family members, six are antagonists and three are characters who have no bearing on this story. Worth mentioning is the fact the hero duo is so overwhelmingly powerful that I questioned finishing this series after five episodes. No matter what danger they face, you know the heroes will win.Throw in a cute mascot to help sell merchandise and we have a winner.

Overall a fair warning this anime does not have a proper ending. Instead, the show has a seasonal ending where everything feels unaddressed.When it comes down to the female characters there was only really two part that made me feel uncomfortable which was how Honoka would address Ayaka's body as being a full figure. Along with the little sister character that was the typical Onii-chan possessive...type. It's not really a harem despite having tons of female characters and one male. Only two characters have feelings for the main character which is Ayaka and the little sister.In my opinion, I actually liked Ayaka but that was because to me she felt relatable. I may be speaking out of my butt but both Ayaka and Honoka felt neurodivergent in my opinion. Especially with how Ayaka has trouble expressing emotions, and she likes being on task and on time. Both the characters didn't seem like they processed social cues in the same way others would. Along with Honoka having a room full of penguins I just thought it was cute to think of them as a neurodivergent couple.The anime does not like to deal with consequences and regularly the anime will just stop permanent damages from ever happening. People never get killed despite buildings falling down and people getting stabbed or blown up. Also, this anime does not care much for magic logic. The show never dives deep into how people become witches, and how they learn witch-craft. They never address how tower witches get their powers.I would only recommend this anime if you like relationships between two awkward teens who seem to have a lot of weight on their shoulders. There are some fun characters but I feel like unless the show gets a season two to just skip it. Read the manga instead. type.

The only thing that prevented me from giving this a 5 was because it had some key story points in which they could've expanded more and would've made the whole anime much better and much more interesting.Art: 7/10| The animation is pretty good actually, I liked the visuals especially during the battle scenes, not much can be said about the animation other than it's pretty good.Sound: 6/10| Like I said about the animation, it's pretty decent for the anime but nothing really special about the soundtracks and music the anime has. Again, nothing can be more said about the sound other than it's okay.Character: 5/10| The anime's Male and Female MC was pretty disappointing. It felt like the MC's just swapped personalities and the writers called it a day. The Male MC seemed like the typical Female love interest who can't really do anything but be eye candy, except it's a guy instead of girl plus the naivety of a Male MC's sense of justice. The Female MC was pretty much the typical Male MC who does all the fighting. To be honest the side characters were much more interesting than the MC's.Enjoyment: 6/10| The anime is pretty much a light-hearted plus action anime during the first half and tried to make somewhat of a conflict during the second half of the show.

I dunno i think it needed...something more something spicy .... something more something spicy ...."", ""Witch Craft Works is an incredibly visually appealing anime with great character designs and concepts that aren’t used all that well, and ends up as a kind of boring, sloppy mess that masquerades as your average battle romcom. Nothing is explained very well, but it's kind of charming anyway.The role reversal concept (male princess, female knight) was what drew me into this anime, and really, it seems like it should be one of the more interesting concepts, but… it goes nowhere. The guy is just generally a useless softie who wants to be better, and the girl is your average kuudere school idol- perfect grades,...trained in every martial art, perfect at everything except expressing her feelings…Everything is pretty. There’s a Senran Kagura-level of creative and memorable design on the characters, and while most of the scenery is typical high school/Japanese city, the few times (2 or 3 that I can remember) they go into magical “witch” areas, the landscapes are absolutely enthralling and magical, in a pastel, harmless way. (Fair warning: there IS CG in this anime. It’s used very little beyond the beginning arc, but it’s not terribly bad or distracting. I kind of like it.)However, how everything is used… is not terribly creative. Most of the episodes jump between two conflicts- that of the main guy’s role as the Chosen One, and as a magic user (“magic plots”), and that of the main couple’s relationship, either in training or daily life (“romcom plots”). The magic plots are usually action-heavy and dramatic, while the romcom plots tend towards slice-of-life banter and very light ecchi. The comedy lands pretty often, for what it’s worth, and the slice of life parts that revolve around the main couple are lighthearted and entertaining.The action, though? The magical abilities are actually quite captivating, with each witch using a specific style of magic that suits their design. The problem is that they show their hand far too early. Characters early on display beautiful magic powers that pretty much blow any other effect in this anime out of the water. It removes a lot of the wonder and excitement at reveals later on in the story.And that’s the main problem- this show’s pacing. It jumps between plots, tones, and intensity far too fast, but with some recognizable patterns. There's always a moment during a slice of life segment where conflict comes in to put it on pause. Or during an action segment, there's some looming cutaway gag from the comic relief that breaks that dramatic tension so carefully created by great villains. (For what it’s worth, all the villains’ designs and fight sequences are excellent. Their motivations? Pretty much non-existent.)(start rant) It’s not… bad. I’ve seen a whole lot worse. It pretty much only switches between 2 tones, and the ending arc is pretty serious all the way through. But I much prefer the slice-of-life segments. Framing this as more of a romance or slice of life (in the vein of Oh My Goddess, or hell, Maid Dragon) would’ve been a lot better, and a lot more conducive to the ensemble cast of villains and heroes. Seriously, having like 10 separate good witches and like 5 separate bad witches that are fleshed out nigh-equally is just horrible for a 12-episode anime! The focus is spread equally among every character who isn’t “main,” and every single one hurts for it. The sister is a bland brocon, the 5-person Team Rocket witch team literally never do anything productive (ignoring a tiny element near the end, that ends up being unnecessary), and the chairwoman… what, honestly did she do? Dang it, you have some good characters. USE THEM. Don’t use them as bait for flashbacks, don’t waste them in one-off fights or gags, don’t restrict their character to one trait. You did fine with the main couple, why limit yourself? There are great ensemble cast series that actually flesh out a wide array of personalities and ideas. Jitsu wa Watashi wa (manga) is a great example- varying amounts of time were spent on each character to help them fit into the environment and realistically involve themselves in future story arcs. If a character is overall useless, or going to be— let them be, look, and act one-bit. Don’t fool your viewers into liking or hoping for the spotlight on characters that are just going to be background butt monkeys. (end rant)6.2/10. Great visuals, great designs, with some good ideas.

Everything revolves around 2 characters becoming a highly overpowered combination, that pretty much becomes an invincible team that no one can do anything against.So when tower witches which seem the majority of witches constantly in groups looking to gain power from attacking these two, they constantly look incompetent and useless as time and time again, they fail to learn from anything they do or the massive gap in power.The story is watchable, but you feel it is flawed on power levels, why tower witches will kill and their...enemies won't, how even for an objective that will benefit one side, they fail to work together, communicate, etc,Slowly it just makes the anime worse from something that could of pushed a 7 with the right narrative down.

Tall Girl and Short boy. Usually, it is vice versa or the main characters tend to be cringe or annoying after awhile. They had a motive to react the way they feel. But it surprised me. It was hilarious at times. Could not stop laughing at those moments. And there were serious moments. But not too serious. And the fight scenes looks good.Music was typical music of an fantasy anime. The ending I did not see coming fully. Art was good. Like I freeze a frame and it looked like a well drawn frame. Not sure if all of...the episodes are like this as I did not pause each one.

But if you like ridiculous animes, then I definitely recommend this. It feels like every episode more and more ridiculous things happen, like if the anime is trying to outdo itself. You have to watch every episode just to keep up with every ridiculous thing that is going on, as they build ontop of each other. That is something that unfortunately the plot does not do, as the plot if fairly weak, but that is fairly typical of comedy animes.

Strike the Blood III,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37449/Strike_the_Blood_III,"[""There is a whole community out there that's waiting for legible subtitles. The ones released so far are horrible, almost as if a child wrote them.I really dig this series, Plus i don't think I'VE seen another anime like it. But we need subtitles. Didn't some company get the License for it? I don't remember seeing II on any english destributer list...There was one guy who goes by the name Lean that released really good one, but he never did Episodes 8-10.I'm hoping I get to watch the ending of this series but it's really not looking promising. "", '""No, senpai, this is our fight!""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.TL;DR - If you liked the series so far, you will like this season.Generally speaking, I watch action to get hyped and drama to catch feels. Similarly, I watch ecchi when you\'re in the mood for some eye candy. Not to say that these are the only reasons, but just what I would expect to look for in these genres. I think most people, to some extent, have similar standards.My problem with Strike the Blood is that, despite all its tags - Action, Ecchi, Fantasy, Supernatural, and Vampire - it never thoroughly explores any of them, and...instead tries to be decent in all fronts. And this has continued for THREE seasons now, and to my utter frustration, it actually gets consistently worse somehow.As for action, most of it is limited to our favorite immortal vampire throwing one or more of his familiars at the opponent, and maybe Himeragi and possibly a few other members of the harem pitching in with their signature moves. Especially in this season, it feels like Akatsuki is a child playing Pokemon, but he\'s just spamming all of his cards as fast as he can. It\'s stale and dull and not the best. But hey, at least they tried.The ecchi parts were never really great, and the art hasn\'t really gotten any better than previous seasons. In certain places, it looks a bit sloppier, but maybe that\'s just me. Fantasy is basically what the story is built on, but the story isn\'t really exceptional either. Supernatural and Vampire pretty much drive the plot by introducing another baddie that Akatsuki will inevitably beat up and/or add to his harem. It gets dull, just like Himeragi\'s very overused catchphrase.I don\'t like the story because every arc is always going to end up being another way for Akatsuki to bond with one or more girls, usually Himeragi and sometimes Asagi. Also, every time they overhype a villain, they have to rush to finish the arc in time, and the final fight ends up having little to no buildup and the conclusion is extremely unsatisfying. There are plot holes literally everywhere you look, which makes it a little more difficult to focus on the measly sliver of a plot that exists. The show\'s mediocrity even shows in the art style; you\'ll notice that they often animate just the mouth of a character, not their expression, which gives them a robotic feel.I don\'t really remember anything about the soundtrack, and there\'s nothing more to say about it. The voice acting is, as expected, good. I was a bit disappointed my personal favorite character, headphones guy, didn\'t get as much screentime. You could base the entire series off of him and this anime would probably be a lot more interesting. The maid is also pretty badass, but a little too one-dimensional to be a good character. Well, I guess you could say that for pretty much every other side character in the series.All the characters have plot armor. To be more specific, Akatsuki Kojou and his friends have plot armor, and the villains have the opposite: they always lose. Since conflict is the source of character development, the zero-stakes plot makes for almost none, meaning that all the girls in the show who have no personality are stuck that way. They\'re so hard to tell apart that I keep forgetting who they are and what stereotype they\'re supposed to represent. The main female lead herself can\'t even break out of the cardboard cutout of a character she is.Speaking of the humor, most of it stems from the harem (just like everything else). It\'s usually one or more of the girls slapping or blaming Akatsuki for an awkward situation or misunderstanding that he has no control over. Asagi and Kirisaka are extremely prone to this, but Himeragi usually uses her staff-thing instead. It\'s repetitive and predictable.In fact, everything in this anime is predictable. Either a current or future harem member is going to have some kind of problem, and our progenitor mc, being the selfless vampire that he is, decides to intervene without even questioning it. Characters who aren\'t in the spotlight barely get animated, but they\'re stuffed in somewhere. Abilities are left unexplained, the plot just keeps rolling around while ignoring the clear problems in the way, characters are introduced then forgotten, and the resolution to the problem is so simple and obvious that there is no sense of accomplishment after the baddies are actually defeated. It\'s a dumpster fire rolling down a hill while mowing down everything in its way, and at the end, rather than climaxing in a big explosion, it just comes to an abrupt stop.Strike the Blood was the first anime I watched, so it effectively got me into anime. I feel like I owe it to the series to see it through to the end. If you\'ve made it this far, you might have similar reasons. But if you don\'t, I suggest you drop this show, because it is bad. And if you don\'t, be warned that the third season is (albeit marginally) the worst of the three. instead tries to be decent in all fronts.

It\'s interesting, fun, full of action, and really something I look forward to watching.The characters are great the plot is interesting and there is so much action! I also love this anime cause it has a slight hint of romance in it as well.My only concern is that the Subtitled versions take a while to come out and, the most recent Sub to come out was not okay or meh it was AWFUL. I love this anime and I hope the subs are not the reason I have to leave it. Other...than that its a great watch!UPDATE!!!So I just finished this anime and well not going to lie the ending was horrible. Characters just didn\'t click for a ""romance"" and the end was super rushed. Season 4 highly doubtful we get one and this also was just so unfortunate. at first, I gave this an 8 for high hopes but whoever subbed this anime my goodness please learn your translations better. it was like reading a toddler\'s first sentence. I\'m very disappointed and now must rate is as average. would be lower but the art and sounds bailed it out than that its a great watch!UPDATE!!!So I just finished this anime and well not going to lie the ending was horrible.

Though this arc drives Nagisa\'s stake in the plot due to December and her condition of holding a piece of Avrora, while the terrorist leader Sega Takehito shows us the true nature of Itogami Island with the purpose of reviving Cain and quite obviously he wants to stop this, where does Asagi come into this?, Cain. As for Koujou and Himeragi of course it\'s to save Asagi and the larger terrorist threat also on the agenda with this arc. Ultimately this is a build up arc and a bit of world building of Itogami island and it\'s not just a hub where humans and demons live together.The Time of My Life\'s arc is centered around Himeragi and once again a rogue magician by the name of Meigo is trying to ""cleanse"" Itogami Island. Himeragi\'s character development is both linked with this arc\'s plot as well as a relational upgrade in the vise of ""not really like that"" but it is. Asagi once again is helping in the background while Himeragi and Koujou are on the field in defeating the rogue magician but unlike Tartarus rose\'s arc, The Time of My Life is more a character-centric arc while having the threat both being in the background but also linked to the plot as well. Really this arc was kinda great if only for the drunk Kirasaka moment and the misunderstanding with Himeragi was yeah OBVIOUS but funny how the dealt with it.The War of Original Vampires arc is the culmination to the previous two arcs as well as the lingering plotline about Nagisa and Avrora, another words, the endgame. The War of Original Vampires deals with the entire reasoning of Itogami Island, Asagi and her stake in this through all the previous stakes she played in, Koujou\'s development as the Fourth Progenitor and it all starts with a Warlord going after the dragon girl Glenda, another person linked with Avrora and Koujou. This arc essentially gives us the mastermind of this entire season and is quite obvious who he is and his goals of destroying Itogami Island...as he just wants to watch the island burn. Asagi oddly enough got great development as a character, sure she\'s still tsundere but what she did to shake up the plot at the expense of what she wanted for Koujou...ehhhh yes partly jealously but LA would had wanted Asagi to go a bit more in depth however with all the subplotlines and the mastermind being in this arc, Asagi just needed a bit more umph but nonetheless Asagi developed quite well for being the tsundere friend of Koujou status and everything. This arc plot-wise was great in terms of escalation, characters developing be it through power or relationships or plot and again the culmination of this entire season due to this, which is what LA likes about Strike the Blood much like the second and first season.The animation done this time ONLY by Connect, well they are still on their game as much as Silver Link has left for this season, but from the always polished and crisp character designs, decent battles sequence though it like the second season falls under the almost typical ""beam spam"" or Koujou using his Persona Familiars and deals HUGE amount of damage etc. but the battle animations were decent all the same. One more thing LA likes about Strike the Blood is it\'s great character designs and for a fanservicey battle harem...yeah it\'s a given they put some detail or polish to the character designs and sure there are some rare derps here and there but Connect still did great and was mostly consistent in terms of animation.Strike the Blood III due to it being an OVA has uncensored nudity much like the second season and all the more for it though oddly it felt like III had less of it in comparison to the second season and as a result did try to be more focused on it\'s plot and characters as a result instead of being all fanservice. But oddly enough due to the gore factor gone up this season, having this season much like the second season being uncensored was great and gave this season much more freedom.The voice cast is back and LA really doesn\'t have much to say, they all did great from Risa Taneda as Himeragi, Yoshimasa Hosoya as Koujou, Ikumi Hayama as Kirasaka, Hisako Kanemoto as Natsuki, Rina Hidaka as Nagisa and Asami Seto as Asagi and this is mostly thanks to how this season though focused on certain characters, this season does tend to move them to get them more involved in the plot one way or another thus more screentime for the majority of the voice cast.Sure Strike the Blood as a whole has the typical anime harem cliches and even this season does have a repetitive format of ""threat appears"", ""Koujou gets some time with one of his harem members and gets with the typical harem cliches but also intimate with them and in turn stronger"", ""Himeragi says this is our fight and maybe one more member helps with the final fight"" and ends the threat but as much as it\'s repetitive, heck even this third season has almost the same plot progression format as it\'s second season did! The next flaw to note is that Strike the Blood does like ALOT of exposition for the audience to keep things in order, but oddly enough it does the exact opposite at times (mainly due to all the terminology, as well as the characters switching sides all over the place thus hard to keep track sometimes) and finally the last flaw, well nitpick is due to Koujou\'s harem being rather big now, the majority of them didn\'t really get screentime and mostly regulated to support, the biggest victim being Yume (as she only appears at the end of the The War of Original Vampires arc) but nitpick. Due to Strike the Blood having it\'s ever steadfast nature to it that doesn\'t dull the senses while watching it (well for LA anyways) and pretty much, keeping it\'s ""don\'t fix what ain\'t broke"" mentality. But yea, that doesn\'t mean LA ignores these flaws, they are there but doesn\'t outright make Strike the Blood horrible per say.Yeah much like LA\'s second season review, LA REALLY likes Strike the Blood as a battle harem and an unabrasive fanservice anime and sure it has it\'s problems with it\'s cliches, expositionary moments and repetitive nature but LA still even now is a fan of Strike the Blood all due to the harem aka. Kirisaka having moderate amount of screentime and is still LA\'s waifu for the series, though The Time of My Life\'s arc felt like it was nudging LA to like Himeragi (which LA does, but Kirisaka is pure tsundere soooo...) and with The War of Original Vampires arc giving us more potential for new seasons what with the large harem Koujou has gathered and especially with Himeragi what with the conclusion.A fourth season had been announced so LA is plenty happy where Strike the Blood is going and where it will go later on, flaws and all. For LA watching Strike the Blood is like eating a cake every 3 days, getting to eat the the cake is decadent and filling and a treat but you\'ll soon see the repetition and flavour over time but still have that cake to have that fanservicey battle harem sugar fillin- LA thinks LA has a problem with Strike the Blood. Guilty Pleasure, guilty pleasure. But with the second season was like it got upgraded to an ice cream cake, then this season upgraded even further to a bloody wedding cake! (pun not intended but became it oddly enough)Himeragi is ""heavenly"" but Kirisaka is still best waifu... arc has Asagi, Koujou and Himeragi in the scene and well Itogami Island is under a terrorist attack.

Asagi oddly enough got great development as a character, sure she\'s still tsundere but what she did to shake up the plot at the expense of what she wanted for Koujou...ehhhh yes partly jealously but LA would had wanted Asagi to go a bit more in depth however with all the subplotlines and the mastermind being in this arc, Asagi just needed a bit more umph but nonetheless Asagi developed quite well for being the tsundere friend of Koujou status and everything. This arc plot-wise was great in terms of escalation, characters developing be it through power or relationships or plot and again the culmination of this entire season due to this, which is what LA likes about Strike the Blood much like the second and first season.The animation done this time ONLY by Connect, well they are still on their game as much as Silver Link has left for this season, but from the always polished and crisp character designs, decent battles sequence though it like the second season falls under the almost typical ""beam spam"" or Koujou using his Persona Familiars and deals HUGE amount of damage etc. but the battle animations were decent all the same. One more thing LA likes about Strike the Blood is it\'s great character designs and for a fanservicey battle harem...yeah it\'s a given they put some detail or polish to the character designs and sure there are some rare derps here and there but Connect still did great and was mostly consistent in terms of animation.Strike the Blood III due to it being an OVA has uncensored nudity much like the second season and all the more for it though oddly it felt like III had less of it in comparison to the second season and as a result did try to be more focused on it\'s plot and characters as a result instead of being all fanservice. But oddly enough due to the gore factor gone up this season, having this season much like the second season being uncensored was great and gave this season much more freedom.The voice cast is back and LA really doesn\'t have much to say, they all did great from Risa Taneda as Himeragi, Yoshimasa Hosoya as Koujou, Ikumi Hayama as Kirasaka, Hisako Kanemoto as Natsuki, Rina Hidaka as Nagisa and Asami Seto as Asagi and this is mostly thanks to how this season though focused on certain characters, this season does tend to move them to get them more involved in the plot one way or another thus more screentime for the majority of the voice cast.Sure Strike the Blood as a whole has the typical anime harem cliches and even this season does have a repetitive format of ""threat appears"", ""Koujou gets some time with one of his harem members and gets with the typical harem cliches but also intimate with them and in turn stronger"", ""Himeragi says this is our fight and maybe one more member helps with the final fight"" and ends the threat but as much as it\'s repetitive, heck even this third season has almost the same plot progression format as it\'s second season did! The next flaw to note is that Strike the Blood does like ALOT of exposition for the audience to keep things in order, but oddly enough it does the exact opposite at times (mainly due to all the terminology, as well as the characters switching sides all over the place thus hard to keep track sometimes) and finally the last flaw, well nitpick is due to Koujou\'s harem being rather big now, the majority of them didn\'t really get screentime and mostly regulated to support, the biggest victim being Yume (as she only appears at the end of the The War of Original Vampires arc) but nitpick. Due to Strike the Blood having it\'s ever steadfast nature to it that doesn\'t dull the senses while watching it (well for LA anyways) and pretty much, keeping it\'s ""don\'t fix what ain\'t broke"" mentality. But yea, that doesn\'t mean LA ignores these flaws, they are there but doesn\'t outright make Strike the Blood horrible per say.Yeah much like LA\'s second season review, LA REALLY likes Strike the Blood as a battle harem and an unabrasive fanservice anime and sure it has it\'s problems with it\'s cliches, expositionary moments and repetitive nature but LA still even now is a fan of Strike the Blood all due to the harem aka. Kirisaka having moderate amount of screentime and is still LA\'s waifu for the series, though The Time of My Life\'s arc felt like it was nudging LA to like Himeragi (which LA does, but Kirisaka is pure tsundere soooo...) and with The War of Original Vampires arc giving us more potential for new seasons what with the large harem Koujou has gathered and especially with Himeragi what with the conclusion.A fourth season had been announced so LA is plenty happy where Strike the Blood is going and where it will go later on, flaws and all. For LA watching Strike the Blood is like eating a cake every 3 days, getting to eat the the cake is decadent and filling and a treat but you\'ll soon see the repetition and flavour over time but still have that cake to have that fanservicey battle harem sugar fillin- LA thinks LA has a problem with Strike the Blood. Guilty Pleasure, guilty pleasure. But with the second season was like it got upgraded to an ice cream cake, then this season upgraded even further to a bloody wedding cake! (pun not intended but became it oddly enough)Himeragi is ""heavenly"" but Kirisaka is still best waifu...', 'Are you tired of vampires?Are you tired of short story arcs with expectable endings?Are you tired of comrade Yukina saying: ""Nyet, senpai, this is our fight!""?Are you tired of teenage boy biting schoolgirls‘ necks?Are you tired of Strike the Blood?...If you answered ""no"" or ""nah"" until now, then congrats, please proceed to enjoy more pantyshots (and more)  of our cute sword shaman, war dancer and  the rest of the fourth primogenitor’s harem.Strike the Blood III is exactly the same as its prequels, expect nothing less, nothing more.

I normally don't do reviews but I feel like I need to voice my opinion (whether you care or not doesn't matter to me). Now, the most pain-staking thing was actually trying to find a valid website to watch this anime on. It was so hard to find one that was properly translated. Eventually I gave up trying to find one because either they don't allow adblock or something of that sort (prone to viruses) or the constant cringe of these hideous translations. Lastly there is very little character development, no relational development...either. On top of all what are these fight scenes? They are so rushed it still doesn't make sense no matter how many times I look at it. SO, what was enjoyable: Asagi, else won't be watching at all. Least enjoyable: Almost everything else, especially character development and TRANSLATIONS GOD DAMMIT! either. On top of all what are these fight scenes?

It\'s stable with the generic repetitive plot. Enemy that want to destroy the city and MC and the heroines that want to protect it. Really fucking boring to be honest, every fight scene I go ""Ah shit, here we go again"". MC get beat on the first battle and drink some heroine\'s blood, come back on the second round with a new familiar and beat the enemy.The only good thing that I found in this season is that the harem setting is legit. The heroines have shown...potential to support the harem end. I really want to know what\'s going to happen in their relationship but too bad I\'ve already burnt out by the boring and repetitive plot so I\'ll be dropping this series at this point.

I misread it!And I don\'t know him OTL)Oho~ Guess I\'ll be the first one to review this OVA!! :DStory: 8/10Tight Rope is ONE of my MOST FAVE YAOI MANGA by Natsume Isaku. So I was really really happy when I learned that it will have an ANIME VERSION!I finished watching the 2 episodes and I must say.. it was good. It didn\'t really disappoint me like those other Yaoi OVAs. And I say it\'s good because even if you haven\'t read the...manga itself, you will understand it and will definitely enjoy it.This OVA is a Yazuza themed story. But not the serious-deep type of Yakuza story. Instead it\'s a rather cute and simple-sweet story. The story will revolve around Ryuu and Naoki, who were childhood friends since they were little. Ryuu is, however, the heir of the Ohara Family. But he is reluctant to take the position because he wanted to be with Naoki (yes he is SUPER attached with Naoki) but because of an incident where Naoki got hurt (not really serious though) he said that if he\'d ever take the position, he have to let go of Naoki. And there are still two months left before their graduation so Ryuu was savoring his time with Naoki.Well something like that. I don\'t want to spoil the story anymore.Animation: 8/10The animation is.. well.. good I guess. But I can\'t help but to think Ryuu\'s looks is kinda different from the manga. Well not only Ryuu but I think Naoki as well. Or is it just me? XD I still prefer what they look like in the manga though. :DSounds: 7/10Well most of Yaoi OVAs doesn\'t have opening or ending songs right.. though the opening and ending songs of this OVA were instrumental.. and I liked it. Their voices, too were good. They speak Osaka-ben.Characters: 9/10Nothing much to say here.. I just love Ryuu\'s attachment to Naoki and Naoki\'s indifference. LOLEnjoyment: 9/10I did say I enjoyed this OVA because it\'s the adaptation of my fave manga!! But the ONLY THING that DISAPPOINTED me is... NO SEX SCENE AT ALL! ;o; Even HINTS!! NONE AT ALL. ToT Only kissing.. awww... and I was really looking forward to see it because in the manga Ryuu and Naoki were sooooo cute! Not that I\'m a perverted fangirl but they could have included ""that scene"" right? Even if it\'s only hints. And as a Yaoi/BL fangirl.. that\'s a must see! But there\'s none! Gaaah!Overall: 8/10Even without the yaoi scene, I guess it\'s okay. I still enjoyed it. So if you want a Yakuza-themed-story yet a sweet-cute one.. then this one if for you! It\'s not explicit at all so don\'t worry if you\'re worried about that. Then if you haven\'t read the  manga.. read it after you watch this OVA!

But this is better than 90% of boyxboy for a variety of reasons.To start off, the storyline is nothing too fancy. It's about a yakuza heir who is in love with his childhood best friend and is very upfront about it. That's it. Is it boring? Somehow, not at all. As a person with a very short attention span (displayed through my aversion to long anime and inability to sit and watch most videos longer than five...minutes) I actually didn't think about stopping watching this at any point. In one go, it was over and I wishing there was more.Surprisingly, the art was really good. Usually, BL suffers from seme-uke syndrome, a condition in which all the art must be modified so that one can tell if the character is a bottom or a top in a gay relationship. The symptoms include boxy/pointy chins, beady/massive eyes, hulking shoulders/extremely lanky figures, and a case of what you make call 'seme' hands, among other things. Thankfully and miraculously, this anime is completely void of these stereotypes and it's very normal looking, actually. It's so nice to be able to watch it and not have to be reminded about sex positions continuously.The opening and closings were not my cup of tea, but they did the job. The background music was barely noticeable, even at the climax. Was it even there? I will never know. The voice actors did great jobs though, which is also rare in yaoi/BL where all the characters constantly either sound like submissive women or bear men if you know what I mean. I much prefer this ambiguity.I really like the characters in this show. There wasn't too much development (it was only two episodes, gotta give them some slack) and not all the motivations made sense all the time, but across the board, it was a pretty standard love story that made sense in the context we were given. Neither of the main two was weak or overly strong and both of them seem to have an even power balance in their relationship as well. I was pleased to note that I ACTUALLY kinda shipped them despite the fact that I usually don't in this kind of show.Overall I really enjoyed this and it was a nice thing to kill a little time. Would I watch it again? Probably not, just because there's not a lot of over-the-top cute moments or plot moments, but I might read the manga to satisfy that craving.I would recommend this if you: are looking for a yaoi/BL with a healthy relationship, dislike seme-uke differentiation and stereotypes, like yakuza tropes, have 40 minutes to spare on a cute love storyI would NOT recommend this if you: kinda enjoy the assaulty type scenes in most yaoi, like overly tsundere ukes or forceful jealous semes, like semes and ukes in general, are here for smexy times (kissing and implications are as far as this anime goes), like longer more developed animeHave a great day everyone! minutes) I actually didn't think about stopping watching this at any point.

This may lead you to think that I really dislike shounen-ai, but that's not the case. I'm a gay guy (yes, I know, outside of most of the target audience) who likes romance and anime, and I think there is good potential to this genre that, as of yet, I have seen unfulfilled--with the exception of a few obscure doujinshi I've read. Of all the shounen-ai anime I've seen, though, Tight Rope comes closest to fulfilling this untapped potential.The plot...centers around an heir to a prominent yakuza family, Ryuu,  and a life-long friend who eventually becomes his lover, Naoki. However, Ryuu feels he must choose between his yakuza inheritance and Naoki, and would prefer the ladder. Right off the bat, it earns points for being a shounen-ai that isn't some stereotypical shojo plot with gay guys stuffed in. There is also quite a bit of potential for character development in this plot and lots of romantic tension, as well as dealing with themes of the desire for love and happiness versus social obligation. Unfortunately, this potential is only partially tapped in execution, though it is passably well done and earns points for moving the genre in the right direction. It could have been a little longer, but the simplicity still makes it fairly good. 7/10As far as animation and art go, it's nothing to remember for being particularly good. There are moments of awkward and slipshod movements, the background sets are pretty minimal and fairly forgettable. There is a bit of connection between the atmosphere and coloration, so it deserves points for that, and it is also directed okay. Overall, it earns a 5/10 for art.When it comes to sound, there's almost no memorable music other than a few dramatic piano lines and only basic sound effects, but this doesn't strike against the anime as it overall has a simple vibe to it. The voice actors are decent and represent the characters well, but it's not exactly memorable for being out-of this world good. 6/10 for sound.Characters are where Tight Rope falls way flat.

So take this review with a grain of salt considering this genre is very much ""We get what we\'re given"" and we covet hugs and blushes far more than the usual romance shoujo anime.But going in as a fan of the manga? It\'s lacking. It is not the manga, and there\'s only so much you can do with an OVA - because let\'s face is, Japan funding a full 12 episode BL anime is a RARE thing. It skipped a lot. It wasn\'t as fleshed out as the anime, and it did...worse for it.However, going in as a stand-alone anime with only 2 episodes to fit a story into?It was excellent. It was satisfying. It\'s what you\'d want from a yaoi anime to scratch that itch. It left me smiling, and the yakuza scenes made me laugh. I could tell the two leads were genuinely in love, and it wasn\'t a rushed ""let\'s meet and have sex"" plot. The characters acted consensually and they always stopped when the other told them to.Which is a lot more than we get for this genre, honestly speaking.It was good.

The characters acted consensually and they always stopped when the other told them to.Which is a lot more than we get for this genre, honestly speaking.It was good. Watch Hitorijime my Hero, Yuri on Ice and the other important yaoi anime before this one, but if you\'re scouring the depths of MyAnimeList and you come across this one? I promise it\'s not too shabby.', 'I am a  yaoi fan, but this just didn\'t work for me. I was not a huge fan and felt bored half the time. Maybe because it was only 2 episodes and there\'s not much you can build up in that time, but what in the world did I just watch? There was zero build-up and it didn\'t make sense at all. The entire show was just one person saving the other from a gang of street fighters and then their relationship was build on ""forced"" love the entire time. I can\'t even tell you if it felt genuine by the end, because the...ending was so rushed and unresolved.I repeat, what did I just watch? I give it a 6 because I sat through it and there were some cute moments. ending was so rushed and unresolved.I repeat, what did I just watch?

There was not even a scene of Maria's father for whom she longs for and the romantic relationship between Maria and Oscar is not shown properly and even seem to vanish at the end of the series. Memore always behaves whimsical and never thinks of her grandfather and her friends except Maria. The story is this only. All the 50episodes round around the concept no story development.Art...is average.Subtitles are horrible.At the end of the series you feel as if you have wasted your time. is average.Subtitles are horrible.At the end of the series you feel as if you have wasted your time.""]"

ViVid Strike!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33589/ViVid_Strike,"[""Vivid Srike was the latest addition to the Nanoha franchise and can come across as kind of jarring for those viewers coming straight off from Nanoha Vivid expecting a direct continuation of the story as Vivid Strike is a side-story of Vivid's narrative taking place a year after the events of said show. Upon watching this show, it could also be kind of confusing since there was just a general lack of information surrounding this show anyway so trying to piece it together can perhaps be a little distracting upon your first viewing. However, despite being a side-story, the newly introduced characters are decently integrated...into the narrative and fleshed out.This season has a greater focus on two new characters in the franchise rather than Vivio or Einhald. If you were expecting Nanoha or Fate to make an appearance than you'll be disappointed. While Vivio and Einhald do have moments of development and some time to shine in their own fights and the such the narrative is, at its core, a tale of two orphan children called Fuuka and Rinne. After Fuuka is adopted by a couple she lives out a brief and happy period with her newly found Grandfather but runs into trouble with bullies at school who push her to her limits resulting in a situation in which she misses the passing of her Grandfather. She then beats the ever lasting SHIT out of the bullies and trains vigorously to become stronger and stronger. Her orphan friend, Fuuka, trains with the previously established characters from Vivid in order to defeat her friend and beat some sense into her. The story is a basic fighting tournament with the main focus of training hard to gain new abilities and using your fists in order to communicate with your opponent. While it is basic in plot structure, it's the characters that shine through an otherwise generic story.There is a decent amount of time invested in both Fuuka and Rinne to make them feel more human and their backstories and motivations are both believable and have enough attachment to the narrative to make the narrative have more stakes and impact. Rinne's backstory was easily the most entertaining part of the anime and is given a decent amount of time to breath and spread its wings. You're able to easily understand why she behaves the way she does which makes her fights feel more real and emotionally heavier too. Fuuka, on the other hand, doesn't feel as fleshed out while still having a decent amount of personal engagement with the narrative. Fuuka doesn't go through the same amount of focus or development in the show aside from her power level increase. However, as a character it is easy to feel the emotional attachment she has with the narrative and thus easier to root for as an audience. It's the effective drama between these characters is the main thing that keeps the show entertaining and helps it to stand on its two feet.While the plot does a decent job at fleshing out character back-stories and personalities it's still not something you've seen before to some better effect. This doesn't necessarily make Vivid Strike's story bad; just forgettable after you've finished watching it and the plot points are also rather easy to predict while you're watching it and you can pretty much guess which direction the show is going to go in. This can make your viewing experience of this show rather tedious as you already know what is going to happen as it follows a basic formula.However, one thing the show did pretty well were the fight sequences. There is a lot of emotion poured into each of the fights which makes them feel as if there is more narrative stakes but it also makes them feel more exciting. The animation and fights themselves were pretty solid, my favorite being between Vivio and Rinne which does a decent job at developing both characters throughout the fight. The final fight between Fuuka and Rinne was also pretty good for both thematics and a good end product for a season of tension building between the two. However, there are some secondary fights which are glossed over entirely and the final fight between Rienhald and Fuuka may have left you kind of disappointed if you did want to see it.  A first for the Nanoha franchise, I believe, is the inclusion of blood and teeth being knocked out during the fights. This not only makes the fights feel more realistic and gritty but it can perhaps come across as jarring for any veteran fans of the show although this was never a problem for me. It never gets to the point where it becomes stupid shock factor either, which I liked.As for overall music it was fine. The opening is generic catchy pop that you'll forget after you've heard something similar and the battle OST does a fine job. Overall Vivid Strike is a decent addition to the Nanoha series with some good action, decently fleshed out cast but the series also remains fun. It doesn't take too much to feel the emotional weight of the narrative and the character's involvement in said narrative. This series works because of the boat loads of heart the characters have in the Nanoha franchise.

I've reviewed the first series, As, StrikerS, Vivid and even the loosely connected Triangle Heart, which has been the only ungood one thus far.  This week I'm going to look at Vivid Strike, which is a side story for Vivid. It was produced by Seven Arcs, the same studio behind everything else I've looked at except, oddly enough, Vivid itself. Let's see if it upholds the franchise's proud traditions of quality and les-yay. That excludes Triangle Heart, obviously.Story:Fuuka Reventon is an orphan with a propensity for trouble. We open with her getting into...a fight with a bunch of ne'er do wells. When law enforcement arrives on the scene, she's forced to flee. She runs right into Einhald Stratos and manages to throw one punch before collapsing from injuries she sustained in her earlier altercation. Einhald sees potential in her and brings her into the Nakajima Gym, offering to coach her in martial arts. Fuuka eventually accepts, hoping to reconnect with her childhood friend, Rinne Berlinetta.The only real narrative issue I have with this series is that it may abridge things too much. A lot of the stuff they skip over is totally justifiable. We don't need to see all the tournament fights. Especially when one of our main characters is going against some Rando and they're obviously going to win because it's a main character against someone who we're just now meeting. However, the unfortunate side effect of skipping over all but a few of those is that we don't get a proper arc for Fuuka and her development as a martial artist. We see her train with the other girls a bit and win a single match before we cut to the climactic fight betwixt her and Rinne. Which really isn't enough to give her a plausible chance. Instead, we get to be told how far she's come by other characters. Because that's just as good as seeing it.That aspect aside, I do have a lot of praise for the story. The conflict between Fuuka and Rinne is really well handled. It acknowledges the mistakes that are made while also showing us the reasons behind them. The scenes showing Rinne's back story are actually highly poignant. The narrative being about these old friends and their trying to reconnect also provides a compelling tension to the narrative that was absent from the regular Vivid anime and using martial arts as a vehicle that could potentially make that happen really works to tie it in with the framework we've already got. I also do appreciate that the tournament doesn't go the way you would normally expect from this kind of series. The pacing is fairly well done, in spite of the aforementioned abridging issue. It has rising action, an intense climax and then adequate time to wrap things up from there.Characters:The character element has always been a strong suit for this franchise. This instalment is no exception. Fuuka has a strong student-master relationship with Einhald. There are a lot of nive little touches that give us insight into her character. The way she talks to the other girls, frequently using nicknames is one. The way she responds to Rinne when Rinne is talking about the lack of understanding other people have towards her is a big one. The dynamic of her and Rinne is the core of the series and it is actually superb. The flashbacks of them together show us very clearly why they mean a lot to each other and add weight to the reconnection plot. Their early interactions also illustrate both the difficulties of rekindling their connection and the yearning to rekindle it from both of them. Which makes things really interesting. I also do like the way it further develops the Vivid cast.Art:the only real art issue I have with this one is that the transformation sequences remain rather sleazy in their usage of fan-service. It does, however, improve on a lot of my issues with Vivid. There's a lot less general fan-service. There aren't any overly fan-servicey outfits on display. We don't see Sister Chantez's stripper nun outfit, for instance. They manage to fight in their matches and keep their clothing intact because, I guess, Seven Arcs is better about that than A-1. I do generally like the character designs. Although, Fuuka looks a lot like IF from Neptunia. Did IF and Compa have a science baby? Come to think of it, Rinne looks a bit like Lady Blackheart but with Neptune's eyes. Did Noire and Neptune also have a science baby? Did the infants get left alone with Neptune and accidentally sent to another dimension?  She probably responded to the justifiable anger by breaking the fourth wall and joking too. Joking tangents aside, the designs are striking and I do like that Fuuka bases her transformation off of her mentor. It's another of those little touches that tells us about her. The action sequences are really good. You can really see the force of the impacts and the animation is just highly polished. And all without having anyone's clothes torn apart. Almost like that was completely unnecessary, A-1.Sound:The performances in this are all great. The strongest come from our main duo voiced by Ogura Yui & Minase Inori. Sakura Ayane, Noto Mamiko & Mizuhashi Kaori also do particularly well. This series probably has the best soundtrack I've heard from Yoshikawa Youichirou. You  may remember him as the composer for Iria & Green Legend Ran. Iria had good music as well, this just has really good music.Ho-yay:As this is the Nanoha franchise, there's a lot of les-yay. The vast bulk of it in this series is between Fuuka and Rinne. We don't see much of Vivio and Einhald's sapphic tension in this one and a lot of our previous couples (Nanoha & Fate, Subaru & Teana, etc.) don't show up. It's also heavily implied that Victoria  has a thing for Rinne. Harry and Els allude to it during a conversation and Victoria just responds like it's completely natural. As she should. There's no shame in her having a crush on Rinne. I don't think she's going to win out over Fuuka in that regard, but I'm sure she'll get over it and find a nice girlfriend of her own eventually. After all, the population in this franchise seems to be ninety percent lesbians. No lack of selection there.Final Thoughts:Vivid Strike isn't just a marked improvement over Vivid. It's a really great series in its own right. The narrative of old friends trying to connect again after falling out really resonates. The action sequences are awesome. The acting is skilful. The relationship dynamic between our leads is amazing. It is, however, not a perfect series by any means. The transformation sequences are overly focused on titillation and Fuuka's coming into her own as a martial artist could have been much better handled. Still, I do recommend it for any fans of the franchise. Even those of you who were a bit disappointed with Vivid. Especially since I was as well. My final rating is still going to stand at a very solid 9/10. Next week I'll take a look at Bishoujo Yuugekitai Battle Skipper. a fight with a bunch of ne'er do wells.

Our protagonist is determined not to let this be the end of their relationship and trains to get her friend back.Artwork is a nice splice show of color. A lot of the characters have differently colored eyes which I...personally don't see why the need.. but nevertheless they are pretty to watch. The environment is pretty much in the near future with buildings looking the same plus the holograph video calls and the miraculous medical technology.I have never been much of a fan of music behind a story however this series plays some nice songs that enhance the suspense of the moments.Overall if you like some nice kickboxing between chicks with a really touching story behind it all, then this is a series for you. personally don't see why the need.. but nevertheless they are pretty to watch.

The story was extremely well done and kept me engaged. It never once lets up and in fact gets better and better.One of the problems I have about shows with massive hype battles/fights, is that the last fight isn\'t as great as one of the previous ones. It leads to a decline in expectations and a sour taste in a ""not as great as it could have been"" ending. Vivid Strike is the exception to this problem. Not once was I disappointing in the plot, in fact I loved the way...the writers kept the suspense and unpredictability. For a show that deals in pseudo MMA, I was constantly kept on my toes and wishing for more. The way they kept the plot from growing stale or weak was extraordinary, in which it was both stupid yet so brilliantly executed. No time was wasted, the entire story was fast paced, and as someone who wants as much story, it delivered hard.The real gem of the show is that I\'ve never seen a show tackle and challenge depression and self-worth as well as Vivid Strike has. A lot of shows that aim to include the theme of depression all end up in a shallow implementation, in which the story progresses just barely to make the character ""deep"" in being able to relate to the viewer. Vivid Strike goes way beyond surface level dialogue on depression and kept the viewer in the reality of things in regards to how the characters were actually feeling. ""Humanization"" is hard and rarely can a story understand the full requirements needed to utilize the plot to make both the character and theme better and more crisp. The characters were without a doubt the best part of the show, and the incorporation of the themes into them was brilliant.The other large theme was the idea of ""nature v nurture"". With characters on both sides of that spectrum. While Vivid Strike doesn\'t necessarily answer the question of which one is better, the character development and subsequent payoff regarding this theme was something to note. It shows what it means to be successful, despite losing or deposit not actual being successful.I hope you watch Vivid Strike, as this is one of the shows that doesn\'t buckle under pressure from itself, and often times surprised me with how good it was. the writers kept the suspense and unpredictability.

Well I did. At least for ViVid Strike!ViVid Strike! was hands down one of the best action anime of all time. The concept of lolis fighting each other aggressively is so appealing. Not just that, there\'s also transformation ( loli converting to ""normal"" ) and martial arts in it along with bullying. This show pumps my adrenaline so hard I\'ve forgotten how many times I screamed during this binge session.Though there are some factors that require some improvements such as some fights being...too fast-paced and the animation needing a little more work so it would become perfect. This anime was awesome and superb.

This anime was awesome and superb. And possibility one of the most underrated things I\'ve ever seen.If you like the following things listed below then you may be interested in the show :1 ) Bullying2 ) Loli3 ) Transformation4 ) Martial Arts ( Fighting )', ""The story for Vivid strike takes place in the near future where mixed martial arts that uses magic that is enhanced by a device is fought in national level sports tournaments. The story follows the main character of Fuuka as she joins a MMA gym in order to get stronger and bring her friend back from the edge that she has got to.Being a mix of both a sports anime and a fighting anime and at the same time featuring magic that allows the characters to change to a adult form i thought that this anime looked interesting and im glad to say that...i was right.Fuuka Reventon is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by Inori Minase one of my favorite seiyuu singers of all time. Fuuka like Rinne is an orphan that lived together in the same orphanage. However unlike Rinne who was take in by a foster family Fuuka wasn't and after leaving it went out into the world of work to survive. Fuuka struggled with dealing with thugs and other hooligans as she did and as a result developing strong skills in martial arts. This got her into trouble many times but as luck would have it she was discovered by Eins who saw the potential in her after taking one of her punches.The central point in this story is to become strong and in Fuuka's case is also to find Rinne who she has a deep friendship with. After discovering that the Rinne she knew was now a much more horrible and merciless person and not the sweet and innocent Rinne that she knew Fuuka decided to join Eins offer and become a martial artist. Training under Eins herself Fuuka's hard work and training paid off and she become a powerful Martial artist who was determined to beat Rinne and rid her of that false personality that she had now.Fuuka is a hard working, diligent and a determined person whose goal is to beat Rinne and drag her true personality back into the light a goal that i actually respect and admire. To do that she has to beat a lot of strong opponents and then face Rinne herself. I felt that the character of Fuuka was a strong character whose goal was a really noble one and a worthy one. Her seiyuu Inori Minase really did a great job portraying her.Rinne is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by veteran seiyuu Yui Ogura. Rinne is Fuuka's oldest friend having grown up in the same Orphanage though they entered it at different times. Rinne and Fuuka were best of friends and both enjoyed their time their. However this changed after Rinne was take by the Berlinnetta family. Though the family treated her like a daughter to them Rinne was heavily bullied in school and this combined with her adapted grandfathers death provoked some changes into her that made her both cold and merciless and started her journey to become strong. As a result when inside the ring she is merciless towards her opponents even being harsh towards them in their defeat as well. Outside of battle Rinne appears to be conflicted not caring about friends and trying to appear strong to others while inside she cracks.Rinne's only goal until her match with Fuuka was to get stronger so that she will will not feel the humiliation of being bullied again which in itself is admirable but the method of doing so is not so. After her defeat Rinne's personality actually reverts back to her original one to which im glad to see and she has found meaning to both her practice of martial arts and to her life as well.I felt that Yui Ogura who portrayed Rinne did an excellent job in playing Rinne as there were different facets to Rinne's personality that meant that only veterans were able to portray them effectively.Eins is one of the main characters of the anime and is played by veteran seiyuu Mamiko Noto. Eins is the current champion of the national level MMA tournament that Fuuka and Rinne fight in. Within the story Eins fills the role of Fukka's master and teaches her the basics of MMA fighting and ending up reaching Fuuka her style of fighting that she uses after being impressed by Fuuka's skills and determination. Being a champion Eins is a very capable fighter and watching her deck Fuuka countless times proves this. Despite being senior Eins can be mischievousness sometimes but she has a well rounded personality being a determined, hard working person that is also clear headed. Her seuyuu Mamiko Noto did a fantastic job as ever portraying Eins.Vivio is one of the main characters of the show and is played by veteran seiyuu Kaori Mizuhashi. A fellow athlete of Fuuka and Eins that trains in the same gym Vivio is the only person that has managed to beat Eins before. Vivio is a positive, competitive and determined person and in a way is the opposite of Rinne. Despite having a weak body Vivio didn't let up and trained relentless to be stronger and as such was able to get to where she is today. It is with this skill and determination that she was able to get so far in the winter championships and manage a victory against her dream opponent despite suffering heavy injuries.Nove voiced by veteran seiyuu Chiwa Saito is the owner of the Gym that Eins, Fuuka and Vivio and Miura train at. While appearing to be rather laid back Nove actually cares about each of her fighters and will always try and support them with whatever she has. Nove believes that all fighters should be given the chance to shine irrespective of their skills and lack of them. This is complete contrast to her friend Jill.Gill voiced by veteran seiyuu of Charlotte and Unlimited Fafnir and Trinity seven fame is Rinne's couch. Partly because of her desire to win and seeing Rinne's ability in martial arts Gill trained Rinne relentlessly while ignoring what Rinne's heart really wanted and as such changed Rinne into the person that she later become. It wasn't until much later that she discovered what these had done to Rinne that she saw how wrong she was and how by putting what she felt as a athlete into her that she was dooming Rinne to the same path. This was however averted with Fuuka's match against Rinne and both Gill and Rinne were able to reconcile and find the true path together.Miura voiced by veteran seuyuu Kanae Ito of Sword art online fame is a fellow athlete of Fuuka, Eins and Vivio that train at Nove's gym. A capable fighter that is equally powerful in both kicks and punches Miura is best described as the peoples person as she can both fight and take care of household chores like cleaning and cooking. Like the rest of the cast Miura aspires to become a professional athlete and aims to graduate from the under 15 cat that she belongs to and join the upper tiers where she hopes to fight Vivio. This is an attitude that i respect a lot as humans should always aspire to get better and improve ones skills and climb ever higher.Arts and animationI felt that the art style that was used in the anime was very well designed with character designs being especially good. Individual scenes were also well designed and colored. The fight scenes for which is extremely important as this is a fighting anime was beautifully designed and the audio behind them was done well.MusicThe music for the anime was really well done especially the opening and ending themes that were sung by Yui Ogura who was the seiyuu for Rinne and Inori Minase who was the seiyuu for Fuuka respectively.Voice actingVoice acting i felt was top notch with praise going to Inori Minase who played Fuuka, Yui Ogura for Rinne and Mamiko Noto for Eins. Additionally Kaori Mizuhashi who voiced Vivio and Kanae Ito who voiced Miura also did a excellent job portraying their characters.In conclusion i have to say that i quite enjoyed Vivid strike as i felt that it had an interesting story, great cast of characters, great voice cast and a great setting and most importantly for a fighting anime some really good fight scenes. Fuuka's determination to save her friend from the edge of despair and bring back her old positive personality i felt was a worthy goal and i was glad that see that it worked out in the end. One aspect that i felt could have been done better was the final fight between Eins and Fuuka as they spent so much time in the lead up only to end the fight like that. But otherwise this was a great anime that i enjoyed. i was right.Fuuka Reventon is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by Inori Minase one of my favorite seiyuu singers of all time. Fuuka like Rinne is an orphan that lived together in the same orphanage. However unlike Rinne who was take in by a foster family Fuuka wasn't and after leaving it went out into the world of work to survive. Fuuka struggled with dealing with thugs and other hooligans as she did and as a result developing strong skills in martial arts. This got her into trouble many times but as luck would have it she was discovered by Eins who saw the potential in her after taking one of her punches.The central point in this story is to become strong and in Fuuka's case is also to find Rinne who she has a deep friendship with. After discovering that the Rinne she knew was now a much more horrible and merciless person and not the sweet and innocent Rinne that she knew Fuuka decided to join Eins offer and become a martial artist. Training under Eins herself Fuuka's hard work and training paid off and she become a powerful Martial artist who was determined to beat Rinne and rid her of that false personality that she had now.Fuuka is a hard working, diligent and a determined person whose goal is to beat Rinne and drag her true personality back into the light a goal that i actually respect and admire. To do that she has to beat a lot of strong opponents and then face Rinne herself. I felt that the character of Fuuka was a strong character whose goal was a really noble one and a worthy one. Her seiyuu Inori Minase really did a great job portraying her.Rinne is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by veteran seiyuu Yui Ogura. Rinne is Fuuka's oldest friend having grown up in the same Orphanage though they entered it at different times. Rinne and Fuuka were best of friends and both enjoyed their time their. However this changed after Rinne was take by the Berlinnetta family. Though the family treated her like a daughter to them Rinne was heavily bullied in school and this combined with her adapted grandfathers death provoked some changes into her that made her both cold and merciless and started her journey to become strong. As a result when inside the ring she is merciless towards her opponents even being harsh towards them in their defeat as well. Outside of battle Rinne appears to be conflicted not caring about friends and trying to appear strong to others while inside she cracks.Rinne's only goal until her match with Fuuka was to get stronger so that she will will not feel the humiliation of being bullied again which in itself is admirable but the method of doing so is not so.

But otherwise this was a great anime that i enjoyed."", ""When i finished anime i was blown away. When i was starting to watch it i was like meh, this is gonna be bad. Didn't even think that this underrated anime had this much emotions and journey combined with sport which i love.Story: Story is about 2 girls Fuuka Reventon and Rinne Berlinetta  that were always together since they were children and they only had each other. ( they were orphans ) And so one of the girls got taken away intro rich family and gets changed by the power and other is being left alone intro the world.Under some circumstances girl from rich...family becomes boxing star just to prove to the world that she is strong, and she is trying to forget her past, even her friend from childhood. And other girl is trying to get her back as her friend. To me it's story kinda full of cliches and everything. 8/10Art: Art was something that got this show quite interesting, didn't expect such a great art. 10/10Sound: Sound was sometimes bad and sometimes good, they could get you hyped for fights only from songs.Thats why i give 9/10Character: Now this is what is core of this anime, kinda cliche characters but still they are like some kinda of motivation and you just keep watching show to see how will they progress and everything cause of their past. 9/10Enjoyment: As i said i was blown away by this show, didn't expect it to be this good, and yes i enjoyed almost whole show but last episodes they could explain it a little more and show characters relationship. 10/10Overall: 9/10 Now this is something you should see, especialy if you are fan of these story's where MC's are fighting with their past and getting from weak to strong. family becomes boxing star just to prove to the world that she is strong, and she is trying to forget her past, even her friend from childhood.

Though their daughter Vivio is still carrying their legacy like a torch, without those two, this just isn\'t a ""Nanoha"" series! In ""ViVid Strike!"" the magical element is mostly ameliorated and the show becomes a series about little girls brawling in a boxing ring! Yes, this might as well be the moe version of ""Ashita no Joe""!⚠️ This review of ViVid Strike! will contain light spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe main conflict of the series is between two childhood friends that are foils of one another. One is a fiery, determined girl...and the other, in their separation has her heart icebound by a series of traumatic events. I won\'t go into spoilers about it here, but Rinne gets bullied so badly that it ends in an absurdly violent scene that is comparable to certain moments in series like ""Blood-C"" and ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" because of the hardcore brutality. And the aggressor of that situation doesn\'t get arrested or expelled from school? Okay, because that\'s believable!So, those unfortunate events lead to Rinne Berlinetta becoming a Fate Testarossa proxy, they even have twin ribbons in their hair! Despite the introduction of more cute girls, like in the original ""ViVid"", there\'s only enough characterization to care about Fūka and Rinne (and there is a nice fight scene with Einhart Stratos and Vivio in the season finale). Since Einhart is practically the only character that I care about in the ""ViVid Strike!"" series, her acting as a mentor to Fūka was a nice change of pace, like ""StrikerS"" it seems like the subsequent generations of girls learn from the main characters of seasons passed!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Junji Nishimura (director), notable works:* Bakuon!! ✅* Basilisk: Ōka Ninpōchō* Bermuda Triangle: Colorful Pastrale* D-1 Devastator* Dog Days\' (Season Two) and Dog Days\'\' (Season Three)* Dr. Typhoon* Fūjin Monogatari* Glasslip* Hamelin no Violin Hiki* Kishin Dōji Zenki and Kishin Dōji Zenki Gaiden: Anki Kitan (OVA)* Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Kyō kara Maō!!

I would say that ""ViVid Strike!"" is more middling, but it leans on the spectrum of bad. There are certain shots and fight scene choreography that shows his finesse in the industry, so I mostly blame the script writing or the lack of inventiveness in the later volumes of the ""ViVid"" manga. For what he could accomplish, I think that Mr. Nishimura did a pretty good job with this series!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅ ✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅Inori Minase as Fūka Reventon, notable roles:* Itsuki Nakano, 5-tōbun no Hanayome (""The Quintessential Quintuplets"") ✅* Maya, Animegatari* Hibiki Iga, Basilisk: Ōka Ninpōchō* Uki Yamazoe, ChäoS;Child ✅✅* Mo Ritika Tzetzes Ura, Comet Lucifer* Ruruka Andō, Danganronpa 3 ✅* Hestia, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅✅* Meiza Endust, Endro* Hidomi Hibajiri, FLCL Progressive ✅* Lico, Futago no Mahōtsukai Lico to Gli* Mirai Nazukari, Futsū no Joshikōsei ga [Locodol] Yattemita.* Tapris Sugarbell Chisaki, Gabriel DropOut ✅✅* Yuki Takeya, Gakkōgurashi!

Her breath of finesse can make a simple character seem more extraordinary, and I would say that this is definitely the case with Fūka Reventon\'s character! I would compare this bold, hard-hitter to her characterization, while voicing Hestia (""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka"") and Nekone (""Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen""), since both of the characters break her usually subdued typecasting shell and are more boisterous or exuberant!

I would compare the role as Rinne Berlinetta to Homare Kagayaki (""Hug tto! PreCure"") and Sana Futaba (""Magia Record: Mahō Shōjo Madoka☆Magica Gaiden""), because both of these characters are still very lovable, but they have a darker side to them!

Though the character of Miura doesn\'t really stand up to the stronger presences of Fūka and Rinne, her performance makes the void characterization an enjoyable spectacle to behold! I would compare her performance as ""Miura Rinaldi"" to her more youthful sounding characters like Yui (""Sword Art Online"") and Nana Astar Deviluke (""To LOVEる""), while her older form is more of an Airi (""Queen\'s Blade"") or Eris (""Asobi ni Iku yo!"")-type of role!

Ms. Mizuhashi has a talent of making the child version of Vivio impossibly adorable, while the adult version can kick some major butt! I would compare her voice as child Vivio to her roles as Michiru Matsushima (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") and Akane Suzumiya (""Kimi ga Nozumu Eien""), because they\'re more youthful-sounding, whereas Vivio\'s older self can be comparable to roles like Mami Tomoe (""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"") and Miyako (""Hidamari Sketch""). Great job with the character!※He\'s in all the other iterations, too, but he\'s more of a pivotal character in the first arc.Mamiko Noto as Einhart Stratos, notable roles:* Karen Minamino, AIka* Fiona, Allison to Lillia* Mayumi Fujimiya, Aquarian Age* Felicità, Arcana Famiglia* Azusa, Azusa Otetsudai Shimasu!* Alice Gehabich, Bakugan Battle Brawlers* Saya Irino (""Black★Gold Saw""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Makie Otono-Tachibana, Blade of the Immortal* Takami Komoda, Bokura no ✅* Lilica Evette, Burn Up Scramble* Kotomi Ichinose, Clannad ✅✅* Satomi Anzaki, Dear Boys* Yukihime, Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera ✅✅✅* Jil, Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk ✅* Yuka, Elfen Lied* Mavis Vermillion, Fairy Tail ✅✅✅* Satellizer el Bridget, Freezing* Alex Benedetto, Gangsta.* Yukinari Sasaki, Girls Bravo* CAL-141, Halo Legends* Mitsuki Ikuta, Hit wo Nerae!* Aya Tōjō, Ichigo 100%* Ana Coppola, Ichigo Mashimaro (""Strawberry Marshmallow"") ✅✅✅* Rin, InuYasha ✅✅* Ai Enma, Jigoku Shōjo ✅✅* Ayano Satō, Joshikōsei: Girl\'s High* Neiro, Kaiba ✅✅✅* Aoi Kannazuki, Kaibutsu Ōjo* Kōta Oyamada, Kanokon* Fujino Asagami, Kara no Kyōkai ✅✅✅* Sawako Kuronuma, Kimi ni Todoke ✅* Kyoko Asahina, 北へ。 ～Diamond Dust Drops～* Emi Kizaki, Kurogane no Linebarrels* Nodoka Miyazaki, Mahō Sensei Negima!* Ōka Sayama, Manyū Hikenchō* Shimako Tōdō, Maria-sama ga Miteru ✅✅✅* Yuri Takikago, Mawaru Penguindrum ✅✅✅* Rin Asogi, Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne ✅✅✅* Anna Liebert, Monster ✅✅✅* Shizu Murasume, TO LOVEる ✅✅* Tsukiko Sagi, Paranoia Agent ✅* Inia Sestina, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse ✅✅✅* Narue Nanase, Narue no Sekai* Akira Sakura, Shadow Star Narutaru ✅* Moriko Morioka, Recovery of an MMO Junkie ✅* Saeko Okuyama, Niji-iro Hotaru: Eien no Natsuyasumi* Haruka Nogizaka, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu* Ririka Nishizono, Occultic;Nine* Fūka Yamagishi, Persona 3* Tomoe, Queen\'s Blade ✅✅* Nayu Hasegawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅✅✅* Aria, Saint Seiya Omega* Yakumo Tsukamoto, School Rumble* Iona Urazoe, Selector Spread WIXOSS* Kenshin Uesugi, Sengoku Collection* Limone, Simōn* Matsuri Shihō, Sola ✅✅✅* Yuki Sōya, Taishō Baseball Girls* Noel Hiiragi, Tansu Warashi.* Aisa Himegami, Toaru Majutsu no Index ✅* Esther Blanchett, Trinity Blood ✅✅* Benten, Uchōten Kazoku ✅✅✅* Rinko Jerrard, The Law of Ueki* Masane Amaha, Witchblade ✅✅* Kotori Monō, X ✅✅* Hazuki Azuma, Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito ✅✅* Kaori, Yojōhan Shinwa Taikei ✅✅* Megumi Hasegawa, よみがえる空 -Rescue Wings-* Tiffania Westwood, Zero no Tsukaima* Kotone Sasaki, Zettai Junpaku♡Mahō ShōjoCommentary: Ms. Noto gives Einhart Stratos the same bright-eyed, ingénue-type of demeanor as Renge has in ""Non Non Biyori""!

I would compare this role to her other voices in ""Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse"" as Inia Sestina, and ""Ichigo Mashimaro"" as Ana Coppola!

I would compare her delightful persona in this show to her role as Konjiki no Yami (""To LOVEる""), though less on the kūdere side — she still plays a character that is the trifecta of adorable, attractive, and a strong fighter! I would also compare her to Asuka Kurashina (""Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm""), because her genki-energy metaphorically drips through the screen. Ms. Fukuen is a great seiyū and gets far too little recognition in English-speaking countries for the fantastic work that she does!Eri Kitamura as Rio Wezley, notable roles:* Yui, Angel Beats! ✅* Koharu, Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman* Sawako Machida, Bernard-jō Iwaku. ✅* Saki Yūtenji, Bihada Ichizoku* Kagari Izuriha (""Chariot""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Saya Otonashi, Blood+ ✅* Anji Zo, Bloodivores* Mina Ashido, Boku no Hero Academia ✅* Liliana Kranjčar, Campione!

I would compare the role of ""Rio Wezley"" to her performances as Karen Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series, boyish and can pack a mean punch, and Yui (""Angel Beats""), single-fanged characters unite! Her pep and cuteness helps animate the series, with the rest of the girls! Great job!Conclusively, this series is another fighting shōnen-style, action series — just like the original ""ViVid""... except that this one has a rivalry, but the magical girl transformations and combat sequences just err more on the side of extreme, every girl has an adult form (inherited from an ancient spirit) now and the fighting is more aggressive. If you\'re looking for a mindless fighting series with cute girls, then this might be your cup of tea. But, it was less of what I look for in a compelling story (aesthetically appealing as it may be), so ultimately I rate ""ViVid Strike!"" a 3/10!Rating: ★★☆☆☆ and the other, in their separation has her heart icebound by a series of traumatic events. I won\'t go into spoilers about it here, but Rinne gets bullied so badly that it ends in an absurdly violent scene that is comparable to certain moments in series like ""Blood-C"" and ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"" because of the hardcore brutality. And the aggressor of that situation doesn\'t get arrested or expelled from school? Okay, because that\'s believable!So, those unfortunate events lead to Rinne Berlinetta becoming a Fate Testarossa proxy, they even have twin ribbons in their hair! Despite the introduction of more cute girls, like in the original ""ViVid"", there\'s only enough characterization to care about Fūka and Rinne (and there is a nice fight scene with Einhart Stratos and Vivio in the season finale). Since Einhart is practically the only character that I care about in the ""ViVid Strike!"" series, her acting as a mentor to Fūka was a nice change of pace, like ""StrikerS"" it seems like the subsequent generations of girls learn from the main characters of seasons passed!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Junji Nishimura (director), notable works:* Bakuon!! ✅* Basilisk: Ōka Ninpōchō* Bermuda Triangle: Colorful Pastrale* D-1 Devastator* Dog Days\' (Season Two) and Dog Days\'\' (Season Three)* Dr. Typhoon* Fūjin Monogatari* Glasslip* Hamelin no Violin Hiki* Kishin Dōji Zenki and Kishin Dōji Zenki Gaiden: Anki Kitan (OVA)* Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Kyō kara Maō!!

His work on ""Ranma ½"", ""True Tears"", and ""Urusei Yatsura"" was impressive, but he also did series like ""Glasslip"", ""Samurai Deeper Kyō"", and ""Bermuda Triangle: Colorful Pastrale"" — I\'m sure you got the idea if you know ANYTHING about ""Glasslip""! I would say that ""ViVid Strike!"" is more middling, but it leans on the spectrum of bad. There are certain shots and fight scene choreography that shows his finesse in the industry, so I mostly blame the script writing or the lack of inventiveness in the later volumes of the ""ViVid"" manga. For what he could accomplish, I think that Mr. Nishimura did a pretty good job with this series!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅ ✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅Inori Minase as Fūka Reventon, notable roles:* Itsuki Nakano, 5-tōbun no Hanayome (""The Quintessential Quintuplets"") ✅* Maya, Animegatari* Hibiki Iga, Basilisk: Ōka Ninpōchō* Uki Yamazoe, ChäoS;Child ✅✅* Mo Ritika Tzetzes Ura, Comet Lucifer* Ruruka Andō, Danganronpa 3 ✅* Hestia, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅✅* Meiza Endust, Endro* Hidomi Hibajiri, FLCL Progressive ✅* Lico, Futago no Mahōtsukai Lico to Gli* Mirai Nazukari, Futsū no Joshikōsei ga [Locodol] Yattemita.* Tapris Sugarbell Chisaki, Gabriel DropOut ✅✅* Yuki Takeya, Gakkōgurashi!

Her breath of finesse can make a simple character seem more extraordinary, and I would say that this is definitely the case with Fūka Reventon\'s character! I would compare this bold, hard-hitter to her characterization, while voicing Hestia (""Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka"") and Nekone (""Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen""), since both of the characters break her usually subdued typecasting shell and are more boisterous or exuberant!

I would compare the role as Rinne Berlinetta to Homare Kagayaki (""Hug tto! PreCure"") and Sana Futaba (""Magia Record: Mahō Shōjo Madoka☆Magica Gaiden""), because both of these characters are still very lovable, but they have a darker side to them!

Though the character of Miura doesn\'t really stand up to the stronger presences of Fūka and Rinne, her performance makes the void characterization an enjoyable spectacle to behold! I would compare her performance as ""Miura Rinaldi"" to her more youthful sounding characters like Yui (""Sword Art Online"") and Nana Astar Deviluke (""To LOVEる""), while her older form is more of an Airi (""Queen\'s Blade"") or Eris (""Asobi ni Iku yo!"")-type of role!

I would compare her voice as child Vivio to her roles as Michiru Matsushima (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") and Akane Suzumiya (""Kimi ga Nozumu Eien""), because they\'re more youthful-sounding, whereas Vivio\'s older self can be comparable to roles like Mami Tomoe (""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"") and Miyako (""Hidamari Sketch"").

I would compare her delightful persona in this show to her role as Konjiki no Yami (""To LOVEる""), though less on the kūdere side — she still plays a character that is the trifecta of adorable, attractive, and a strong fighter! I would also compare her to Asuka Kurashina (""Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm""), because her genki-energy metaphorically drips through the screen. Ms. Fukuen is a great seiyū and gets far too little recognition in English-speaking countries for the fantastic work that she does!Eri Kitamura as Rio Wezley, notable roles:* Yui, Angel Beats! ✅* Koharu, Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman* Sawako Machida, Bernard-jō Iwaku. ✅* Saki Yūtenji, Bihada Ichizoku* Kagari Izuriha (""Chariot""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Saya Otonashi, Blood+ ✅* Anji Zo, Bloodivores* Mina Ashido, Boku no Hero Academia ✅* Liliana Kranjčar, Campione!

I would compare the role of ""Rio Wezley"" to her performances as Karen Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series, boyish and can pack a mean punch, and Yui (""Angel Beats""), single-fanged characters unite! Her pep and cuteness helps animate the series, with the rest of the girls! Great job!Conclusively, this series is another fighting shōnen-style, action series — just like the original ""ViVid""... except that this one has a rivalry, but the magical girl transformations and combat sequences just err more on the side of extreme, every girl has an adult form (inherited from an ancient spirit) now and the fighting is more aggressive. If you\'re looking for a mindless fighting series with cute girls, then this might be your cup of tea. But, it was less of what I look for in a compelling story (aesthetically appealing as it may be), so ultimately I rate ""ViVid Strike!"" a 3/10!Rating: ★★☆☆☆', 'Haven\'t seen an anime about cute girls going fisticuffs beating the living shit out of each other can be this exhilarating!For LA, ViViD Strike was hardly on LA\'s radar during the Fall 2016 Seasonal Roundup and LA really didn\'t care about it, why?, because of it\'s predecessor within it\'s own spinoff...Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD. Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD\'s truncated ending during a TOURNAMENT ARC as well as changing of genres from magical girl fantasy to shounen fighting put LA off the Nanoha franchise, but ViViD Strike! quite honestly is the saving grace and rejuvenation to the ViViD franchise. But this isn\'t a review...of Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD, it\'s about ViViD Strike!, let\'s get on with this.The plot revolves around Fuuka Reventon voiced by Inori Minase, a girl living in poverty until she chance encounters Einhart Stratos voiced by Mamiko Noto discovering that she has talent for fighting and with Fuuka agreeing, as she gets a job at Nakajima Gym and is coached by Einhart, why?, so that she can face her childhood friend Rinne Berlinetta voiced by Yui Ogura for a chance to see why she changed like she did which caused the rift between the two. The anime\'s timeline is 2 years after Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD and sure the main protagonist isn\'t Vivio, but this  integrates Fuuka\'s main goal to the rest of Vivio\'s cast.Let\'s look at the characters, as one of the best strengths to ViViD Strike!, characters and their character development. The two best characters developed throughout the anime goes to Rinne and Fuuka. Rinne\'s character development about how she became the stoic, merciless yet revered fighter is what got LA hooked into this anime. LA will go into slight spoilers but let\'s just say that Rinne was cruelly bullied in school and ViViD Strike! managed to NOT do a typical bullying backstory by managing to USE violence as a means to justify Rinne\'s bullying BUT with BOTH parties suffering the consequences and quite honestly, LA was utterly shocked by Rinne\'s actions that broke her into ""resolving"" the situation, it\'s a brilliant and visceral yet simple take on the bullying backstory and damn did it have impact. Rinne\'s backstory given also shows that ViViD Strike cherishes it\'s morality as ""no one is outright evil or no one is always justly good"", always a moral gray area which is greatly manifested in Rinne. Yes, Rinne is LA\'s favourite character, not only due to her badassery, but her character development and backstory helped immensely. Adding to it, Rinne\'s character development during the tournament also gave her alot more development in the form of her own character resolution. Fuuka herself steadily gains character development during the course of anime but it\'s mainly together with Rinne due to their clash of ideals that transition into their fists later on. Fuuka not only grows as a fighter but she too steels her resolve in wanting to not only fight Rinne, but get her childhood friend back.On speaking of clash of beliefs, as ViViD Strike! revels in it\'s moral gray area, this also manifests in Fuuka\'s and Rinne\'s coaches (Nove voiced by Chiwa Saito and Jill voiced by Ayane Sakura respectively). Nove\'s coaching of putting in the effort and pure determination clashing with Jill\'s strict and intensive training with Jill\'s beliefs of thinking that fighters needs to be BORN with talent in order to get anywhere not only adds to their own character development, but due to both their teachings to Fuuka and Rinne, also rubs onto Fuuka and Rinne\'s own beliefs. Mind you due to the moral gray area, there really isn\'t ""REAL VILLAINS"" (Yes, not even Jill is and LA thought that Jill was ""evil"", but even her beliefs and her actions speak louder not making her evil at all, just putting her best of intentions to Rinne...ohh Rinne\'s bullies definitely were, but Rinne is equally at fault) in this anime which makes it very good thing due to the anime genre it is.Back to characters, you\'d think that due to the focus largely on Fuuka and Rinne that the rest of the cast are supporting and yes they are.....however because of the basic tournament style, we do get to see WHY the supporting cast wants to fight building their character development, the major one going to Miura Rinaldi voiced by Kanae Ito, Vivo voiced by Kaori Mizuhashi and of course Einhart Stratos. But for the rest, expect them to be the ""peanut gallery"" watching from the sidelines and telling how certain fighting styles or attacks ""hurt"" or ""have the upper hand"" etc.Finally, LA will say that as ""generic"" as a fighting tournament anime is, they don\'t make immediately obvious who\'s gonna fight who even with the format of a tournament arc making some of the fights like Rinne vs. Vivio all the more impactful, adrenaline pumping and unpredictable as to who\'s gonna win or not, also during the tournament arc, due to a promise by Einhart, Rinne WAS gonna fight Fuuka no matter what, making who\'s gonna fight who even more unpredictable, heck even who\'s gonna WIN is even more unpredictable due to how powerful and balanced each of the main cast them are (obviously this excludes the minor contestants as they get KO\'d quite quickly so that the tournament can move on to the more interesting fights).In the voice acting department however, LA will say that there are some notable ""playing against the type"" roles LA took notice of from Rinne Berlinetta who is voiced by Yui Ogura (mainly because of her voicing a stoic and apathetic badass) to LA\'s main surprise of Ayane Sakura voicing Jill (the calm ojou yet almost sadistic belief to her coaching a la tranquil, scheming villainous character something LA has NEVER seen Ayane Sakura do a role in), for the rest of the vocal cast who reprised their roles from Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid were expected with some squeakers from Kaori Mizuhashi as Vivio, Eri Kitamura as Rio Wezley (her hyper genki tonal vocals get high pitched at times) and Kanae Ito who voiced Miura Rinaldi. Inori Minase who voiced Fuuka Reventon, the main protagonist in ViVid Strike!, she did a decent job overall but she shone when getting into her serious *cough* angry Rem vocals *cough* but LA was more interested in the playing against roles like Ayane Sakura and Yui Ogura...on speaking of which, LA\'s favourite voice actor from ViVid Strike! would go to Yui Ogura, though she had some competition in the form of Ayane Sakura, Inori Minase and Mamiko Noto but nonetheless, considering how complex Rinne was, it only benefited into LA liking Yui Ogura\'s performance even more.In terms of animation by Seven Arcs Pictures, the animation is slightly inconsistent at times especially in the later last quarter of the anime with some facial derps or some lower quality at times. The character designs are expected moe and all the characters are distinct but that\'s too be expected when many of the characters have their own distinct style (hairstyle, accessories, transformations etc.) but when they really brought their all, is during the fighting and ohh boy did they go all out for that!, the fighting animation is greatly animated and isn\'t deterred by the lower quality as well (yes, it happens but LA doesn\'t care, the fight scenes are AMAZING), if there is one praise LA will have to say is the great fighting animation and offside, the facial animation in showing expression in some of the characters were done splendidly.As much as LA is praising ViViD Strike, LA needs to be a bummer and say some of the flaws, if there are any and yes, LA already talked about the derpy animation at times, but LA will re-emphasis again that the majority of the supporting characters are nothing but that and are more spectators and expositional fighting style manuals than ""characters"" (exceptions being Jill, Nove, Einhart, Vivio and Miura), next would be the the fact that if your expecting a Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD sequel, if you read this far, it\'s quite obvious that the focus isn\'t to Vivio or it\'s ""her conituation"" from Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD, but with that Fuuka and Rinne\'s plot focus is more than enough and this is hardly considered a ""flaw"" more like expectations, LA\'s anyways, but anyways these flaws hardly deter LA from hating this installment of the ViViD franchise.ViViD Strike!\'s ending like Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD left on the finals, HOWEVER unlike Nanoha ViViD where it left on the tournament with no compromise, ViViD Strike! on the other hand gave us a compromise in the form of a resolution between Rinne and Fuuka and LA will easily take that, even if ViViD Strike! and Nanoha ViViD Strike! essentially did the same thing of NOT finishing a tournament, hell in ViViD Strike!\'s case, the tournament wasn\'t the primary focus, it was about Rinne and Fuuka and giving it a resolution was the best compromise to that.ViViD Strike!, really was a surprise for LA, not only as a fan of the Nanoha franchise but for Fall 2016 Seasonal Roundup as well. As a fan of the Nanoha franchise, ViViD Strike! may not appeal to it\'s fans due to the change of genre from magical fantasy fights to magical tournament fighting like LA did with Nanoha ViViD but ViViD Strike!\'s brilliant character development of Rinne and Fuuka that pretty much carried the entire anime to the amazing fisticuffs battles, clash of ideals and the moral gray area really rang through throughout the entire installment for LA and gave new light to the ViViD franchise and what it can do with it\'s magical tournament fighting genre. Sure ViViD Strike! has some flaws of inconsistent animation, supporting characters being expositional mouthpieces and nothing more and also the same flaw that got LA pissed off with the Nanoha ViViD of not finishing a tournament   did, ViViD Strike!\'s strengths definitely outweigh it\'s weakness. As a Fall 2016 Anime and as an anime LA dismissed while it aired, LA cannot have been more wrong in dismissing this anime and quite honest belongs in LA\'s Top 5 Best Anime of Fall 2016 to be perfectly honest. ViViD Strike! is most definitely a hidden gem of Fall 2016, be it if your a fan of the Nanoha franchise, the Nanoha ViViD sub-franchise, wanting to see a tournament style anime done with a twist or a complete newbie. ViViD Strike! will get your adrenaline pumpin\'!....with heart of course. of Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD, it\'s about ViViD Strike!, let\'s get on with this.The plot revolves around Fuuka Reventon voiced by Inori Minase, a girl living in poverty until she chance encounters Einhart Stratos voiced by Mamiko Noto discovering that she has talent for fighting and with Fuuka agreeing, as she gets a job at Nakajima Gym and is coached by Einhart, why?, so that she can face her childhood friend Rinne Berlinetta voiced by Yui Ogura for a chance to see why she changed like she did which caused the rift between the two.

It's really a mixed martial arts anime that gets brutally violent, which is made immediately apparent from the first few minutes of the show, when our feisty main character gets slammed over the head with a lead pipe and then proceeds to get the shit kicked out of her by a bunch of thugs.Though not all the fighting is well animated, generally the fights are choreographed fine. You...won’t get a whole lot of *teleports behind you* “heh nothing personnel kid” (unlike this show’s parent story, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid). There is magic in the show’s universe, but it’s not present in the actual fighting, since the story covers a non-magic tournament. Something you’ll notice right away are the sound effects of the punching and kicking. The sound effects really sell the idea that there’s actual weight behind the punches from these little girls. On top of that, when someone gets hit, you’ll watch their eyes widen in shock and pain. You’ll see them hacking up spit, blood, and teeth. You’ll hear bones breaking. It’s actually kind of funny how often you’ll see someone carried out in a stretcher in this show; it’s almost every other episode. I think you’ll also appreciate that not every fight has an obvious winner.This show gets oddly detailed in some places, while missing the mark in some obvious areas that can ruin your immersion. For example, when one character carries out revenge on some punks, there are, shockingly, legal consequences for her actions. But how are there punks enrolled at a rich kid school in the first place? And the confrontation following the revenge is even less believable. I also think the character motivations are not totally fleshed out, which calls into question if there are any real stakes in any of these fights. And if you’re looking for a show that takes a deeper dive into fighting technique like Hajime no Ippo, you will probably not be satisfied, though that kind of thing doesn’t matter to me at all.I do like that the show threw me some minor surprises every now and then. A cliché in shows about competition, such as Ping Pong the Animation, is the dichotomy between in-born talent versus hard work, and the prevailing of one over the other. A coach for one of the girls believes that only talent matters, while, supposedly, the rival coach believes the exact opposite and that only effort matters. In the bonus episodes, she explicitly denies ever holding such a viewpoint, saying that she agrees that there’s such a thing as futile effort, adding some nuance where I anticipated a one-dimensional take on the subject. There was also another instance where one of the girls starts talking to the other in the middle of a match. This isn’t actually that weird in the context of anime, so I was surprised when the round was over that her coach calls her an idiot and tells her that she’ll lose points because of it.This show isn’t the greatest, but I never got bored watching it, and I think it’ll end up being one of the more memorable things I’ll ever watch. In retrospect, I may have inadvertently watched a show made to appeal ryona fetishists… but whatever. won’t get a whole lot of *teleports behind you* “heh nothing personnel kid” (unlike this show’s parent story, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid).

In retrospect, I may have inadvertently watched a show made to appeal ryona fetishists… but whatever."", ""Story (7/10):Think of your typical Magical Girl anime. You got cute little girls, cool transformations, fancy movies, dark pasts, and the an ultimate goal of saving the world ........ actually scratch that last one and replace it with a fighting sport that for some reasons only girls participate in (obviously) and you will get the main premise of ViVid Strike!. A simple plot the doesn't need much effort to follow.The story started quickly with a little introduction and went straight the main stuff with no delaysthe ending was very predictable.Characters (6/10):I guess being a spin-off from another anime the creators didn't really feel the need...to put much effort on giving much depth to the characters. Except for the two main characters (who seem to be new characters to the franchise) and maybe one or two of the supporting characters, the other charters seemed kind of flat and were their to move the story along. Even the main character were not that deep. They did try to throw a couple of flashbacks here and their but it was not enough. Someone with past knowledge of the franchise might find the characters more appealing since they are already known to them (was not the case for me)Art and Animations (5/10):Nothing special can be said about the art in this anime.

You would think an anime about fighting would have some sweet animation but sadly it did not.

But the fact that it is a spin-off showed clearly in it's making. it was something you could watch when you are bored and want some mindless action with cute girls and oddly no ecchi and negligible fanservice (one or two scenes)Overall (6.5):a good and tried concept that suffered from lack of attention to details for the most part to put much effort on giving much depth to the characters. Except for the two main characters (who seem to be new characters to the franchise) and maybe one or two of the supporting characters, the other charters seemed kind of flat and were their to move the story along. Even the main character were not that deep. They did try to throw a couple of flashbacks here and their but it was not enough.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------An odd case where personal enjoyment strongly wanted me to score it 6. But other aspects were actually good and if even enjoyment weighs more, it isn\'t enough to counterweight the other scores.✦StoryNot gonna say much aside that it\'s simple sport/magic Anime that takes place in Nanoha universe. So Hajime No Vivio/Fuuka/Nanoha whatever rings the best. This time there actually was a bit of backstory, development and weight to the story. I found it enjoyable adventure. It wasn\'t anything amazing, but wasn\'t boring or bad either. It...was simply good and enjoyable.But still find it weird how newer Nanohas turned into sports Anime.✦Art&SoundSimple, vivid and quite good looking art. Plus fight sequences were quite flashy and cool. Not as magical but more of a martial arts side. Transformation sequences were okay. Transformations provided some sexy fanservice too to some extent. (more fanservicy sexual side transformations than older trademark transformation sequences)Songs I don\'t remember much but I did like the OST, they did pack some punch and hype.✦CharacterSame as usual, moegirls doing stuff. But extra point for having some actual development and backstory. With extra bit of edginess.✦Enjoyment&OverallProbably it being to sporty and vivid was a bit of a turnoff for me. Transformations weren\'t as cool and were more of a sexy. Enjoyment was solid 6 for me.But in the end considering I gave every other aspect higher rating then enjoyment isn\'t enough to lower it.So yeah, want to watch vivid sports martial arts arena with a tad bit of a magic , with a bit fanservice and cute girls doing cute stuff, then it\'s good anime to watch. also has a bit more depth to it in comparison to Nanoha Vivid series. was simply good and enjoyable.But still find it weird how newer Nanohas turned into sports Anime.✦Art&SoundSimple, vivid and quite good looking art.

Atleast, that was the case for me. I remember watching the clip one late night and becoming interested in the anime due to the explicit scene, wondering how the series would be. So I looked it up and not long after I started watching it.The first few minutes begin with a scene setting up Rinne's and Fuuka's childhood together, which gives more insight to the characters. Soon after we get to see a grown-up Fuuka crying alone on the stairs, Rinne no longer by her side. We...find out she is alone and gets by working one job, also starting many fights on the street. After one of these fights she accidentally stumbles upon Einhard, whom is a Keiser arts champion, and attacks her. Fuuka is stopped and passes out due to her injuries. This meeting is what starts her job and life in the Nakajima gym.There she befriends many fighters like her and becomes an apprentice of Einhard, having to follow training as well. What I like about the training and the fights throughout the series is that most of them are rather realistic, not portraying Fuuka as some overpowered character being able to defeat anyone in her way and actually receiving damage. Although in other fights she wins way too quickly for my liking and gets away with barely any scratch, predictable. I suppose it could be explained with her enormous strength and magic. Other characters get to shine too in terms of fighting and development, instead of just being there which makes them more of use. There are however a few smaller characters randomly introduced and never seen much, but seem to have somewhat of an importance to the story. Not all of them, there are enough characters who have no purpose and could have been left out without missing anything.The build-up of the story doesn't seem to be too rushed and you get to see an actual development regarding certain characters. Especially Rinne, who fights to become the strongest, begins to wonder if her philosophy is really correct. She is brought down and challenged many times but she always gets up and fights back. The same applies to Fuuka who wasn't planning on doing much until she fixated her goal on defeating Rinne, wanting to bring back her old self. Their relationship together undergoes many changes, they go from childhood friends to enemies and back to friends again.Eventually, around the end of the series, they get to fight again for the first time in years and are both set on defeating each other. It is no short fight and despite the many injuries they obtain, they still continue fighting until it is Fuuka who wins. The battle was intense and both opponents were equally as strong. Although the continuous talking sometimes stretched it out and seemed rather pointless as they were supposed to be punching eachother instead, not mushy talking.After the fight the two quickly recover from their injuries and suddenly they're friends, just like that. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for it, but they have had a long love-hate relationship for eachother and the fight looked more gloomy then as making up. I would figure they would struggle more befriending eachother again but apparently that doesn't seem to be the case. After this the end of the series is left open, ending with a scene of Fuuka and Einhard about to fight each other in the tournament.Overal the story wasn't that spectaculair but I enjoyed watching it and it had many good moments as well. The cast was rather varied in terms of looks, their personalities however were less enjoyable for me. It seemed to be either mostly the same or completely obsessive like Rinne's trainer. She only made sense towards the end and before that she annoyed me a lot with her controlling behaviour. Rinne seemed to have a split personality, switching between intense anger and childlike shyness. Another thing that annoyed the shit out of me were those floating animals, if they were left out it would've saved me a massive headache.The soundtrack was quite nice and 10/10 would listen again. The art also had a nice touch to it and most of the scenes were drawn well. No problems there. As for the recommendation, it is a nice series to watch for a change and if you were wondering if you should watch it, definitely. find out she is alone and gets by working one job, also starting many fights on the street.

The fan service is low and the story and fight scenes are very good.I thought it would be a normal hero story with linear A to B story lines I was pleased this was not the case. The plot changes was very unexpected which kept you wondering how things would play out and for whom.Early on you find yourself empathizing with the secondary main character then kinda disliking her then liking her again. You find the inverse with the main character.The background characters are easy to connect with and to be honest Vivio is my favorite a even better story...and development than the 2 mains.It leaves you on a cliff hanger but apparently Vivid Strike Specials has the 13th episode. I'm on my way to that. and development than the 2 mains.It leaves you on a cliff hanger but apparently Vivid Strike Specials has the 13th episode. I'm on my way to that."", ""Vivid Strike to me I found it pretty enjoyable to be quite honest, also coming from watching all the series of lyrical nanoha, I found it pretty good there were somethings that really bothered me about it though, since again after Strikers we would expect season 5 to develop abit more on Vivio and einheart abit more also since back in season 4 even if the story was meant to talk about Vivio abit more as the main character or eiheart and vivio instead of moslty focussing on einheart which was disappointing, I see this  alot in this season as well Einheart is fuuka's...trainer which is fine and Einheart as a character I like her very much I just wished we got abit more from vivio since she was quite important as well, in the last few episodes the way they depicted her of being a weaker character than the others kinda annoyed me since back in season 3-4 it was more about her being OP and learning and all so, after all those years I'd expect Einheart and Vivio to be coaching some of the other characters as their seniors and all, the story overall was pretty good,  I really liked the art style, I'm still pretty disappointed that after season 4 the series kind of diverted towards something else which isnt what the nanoha series is about, which I find it to be a real shame if anything. because its just martial arts with magical device and its mostly just for show I dont think there is a reason to have devices even back in strickers and A's sure fate and nanoha had devices but it wasnt just for show they had a purpose i get that in this season its for protection but I wish we got to see what do they do whats soo special about these devices more talking from them sure the small chibi animals were cute but its not what the series is about its cute with a side of cool and futuristic this felt very generic, when i first discovered this season I didnt know it was part of the nanoha series I just thought it was a martial art anime with a side of magic really, not until I saw vivio  and all so yeeeI kinda wish that after season 4 they would develop einheart and vivio story and maybe go back to what nanoha was originally about TSAB and finding lost logias finding differently worlds since back in season 1 they did mention there were other worlds that had collapsed or that were there getting to know more about Alhazrad i cant spell that name but yeeeee p much then probably later down the line introduce rinne and fuuka in another season they were cool characters I will admit i love the design and everything and perhaps it would become something else,though i do prefer this season  compared to lyrical nanoha vivid, the battles were pretty nice near the end and had a nice story and art style overall, it was a pretty good anime, but as someone whos pretty passionate about the series im just really disappointed about where the series went to in the end it wasnt really about fighting bad guys and all and having your devices talk to you every time they made a move the devices now were just more like lil animal sidekicks, it was just pure martial art stuff I dont think they even needed a reason to have devices it just makes it not special really  the transformation sequences and outfits were nice but I just felt it was abit generic i dont how to put into words im not really good at writing reviews this is mostly based on  how I feel.If anything I'll say decent anime but doesnt feel like its part of the nanoha franchise at all and just develops into pure martial arts its not really lyrical nanoha anymore its just magical martial artist rlly, but overall its alright trainer which is fine and Einheart as a character I like her very much I just wished we got abit more from vivio since she was

Inside a fight she acquires a vocabulary.People who like to watch other people playing fight games will be happy with this.', ""I did not have a good time with Nanoha ViVid. It was confusing, had too many characters, had no real stakes compared to previous series in the franchise, and didn't have an ending. I was determined to not like this series going into it because of how boring the show it's a spin-off of was. Luckily it manages to skirt around all that by doing something completely unexpected: they remembered to give the audience a reason to care about the characters.Specifically the two main leads. Vivio and the other heterochromia girl were boring, so they are rightfully pushed into the background to make way for...yet another duo of young... magicians? Athletes now? Okay I guess they're strictly martial artists now and even magic has been pushed to the background. I was so checked out from how stupidly frequent the soft reboots in this franchise are by this point I just decided to go along with it. I didn't expect much, but by the fifth episode I was somehow more invested in these characters than I ever had been in Vivio.Let's face it, Vivio is a mary sue. She never really faced any hardship and is instantly loved by pretty much everyone. There wasn't really any conflict in her own outing as the protagonist and the stakes became lower than ever when they turned a magical girl anime into a sports anime. But here they make you care about the main two girls using the oldest emotional manipulation trick in the book, tragic anime backstory. I was bullied in middle school, so I love a good bullying story in anime. The raw, visceral emotions forced upon the victim are always compelling, and the moment of karmic justice is always oh so satisfying. Let me be clear, I enjoy bullying subplots only if they end with the aggressor getting their comeuppance, and oh boy that moment where she breaks the girls arm and bashes the other against the locker is so cathartic I could watch it on repeat for hours. She was absolutely in the right, and frankly those girls got off easy.The crux of the rest of the story is that she feels deep regret for the way she responded to that incident and hates herself, feeling that her grandfather would have been ashamed. I disagree, if your being pushed around and you have the power to stand up for yourself I say do it. I know all too well the feeling of powerlessness that can come from that situation, and I totally understand why Rinne became the way she did in order to make sure it never happened again. I think Rinne did nothing wrong.I know I know I probably sound like some sort of psychopath who loves child violence, and you're probably right, I enjoyed that way too much.

Not just because it\'s separated itself from the long departed concept of Lyrical Nanoha (in themes and name, including abandoning the magical girl aspect itself), but because it throws so many concepts of even ViVid out the window, which is surprising given it directly follows ViVid. What I mean by this is: if you\'re looking for a Lyrical Nanoha series, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. However, if you\'re just watching it to stand on its own, it\'s actually an extremely impressive tale. Therefore, this review is by fault...up to interpretation and intent of the viewer whilst watching. Since ViVid Strike made such a direct attempt to step forward, this review will largely treat it as an extension of ViVid, but not as though it was a part of the Nanoha franchise.The first thing to note is the somewhat odd dynamic of the main characters. Without getting into many spoilers, the dynamic initially resembles the standard ""tough girl"" and ""sweet girl"" pair, a la Nagisa and Honoka of Futari Wa Pretty Cure; however, this dynamic quickly falls apart and becomes subverted once it becomes clear things are far more complex than this. Expanding on this, the girls have a genuine rivalry with each other due to their differing viewpoints. Both of them bring their own philosophies influenced by their ways of life thus far, and both begin to question their own paths once it becomes clear the other is in an immovable viewpoint. This creates a refreshing yet horrifying contrast on the typical friendship dynamic: yes, they\'re friends on the surface, although they\'re two of the most different people alive and certain to butt heads repeatedly, which they do with vigor in a martial arts series.One of the other strong points of ViVid Strike is its insistence on focusing on bullying, abuse, and mental health. Without spoiling, I can confidently say I was heavily impressed with the way character development was handled. It wasn\'t shrunk into a childish or immature view, pushed off, or even excused; it was seen for the horror it is and its mental impact on those affected is not to be underestimated. Not only this, the series was able to use it to propel character development for the affected and make use of it in unexpected ways. On the other hand, this ties back into the martial arts aspect: needing to find physical strength to justify mental weakness is (as expected) almost assured to be a very touchy subject for some, and especially for those who have or are suffering from it. Making a character a stand-in to represent exactly how or not to deal with it is an even more bold challenge, though ViVid Strike manages to keep its preachiness delicate, to the point, and not in the viewer\'s face. It\'s even ultimately left to interpretation and moreso ""guides"" the viewer than it does force them how to feel. Overall, there is an amazing level of representation for bullying and mental health awareness.Admittedly, the fights aren\'t as great. I understand it was based on a martial arts series and that of course the aforementioned elements take priority, but the fights were significantly watered-down compared to ViVid. Tournament battles lasted all of ten seconds with not much impressive occurring, as the action was drowned out by an ever-present announcer, forcing the series to stop and explain what happened every ten seconds followed by a few more minutes of explanation. As a martial arts series, it thus fails to leave a lasting impression.Overall, ViVid Strike is a heavily recommended series that, even standalone, is sure to leave a lasting impact and will help anyone suffering from mental illness, with a gripping story nonetheless. Ironically, Nanoha fans will probably enjoy this least, given how much it stems off the traditional format, but it is wonderful nonetheless. 8/10. up to interpretation and intent of the viewer whilst watching.

While that seems so, there’s suggestions that the show itself builds more for just the road to earning success. It suggests that the characters themselves are on their personal road to not only become an idol but also to change themselves. But for a show to succeed in this way requires development, something that is staggering for just 12 episodes. It’s also important to watch the movie (Wake Up, Girls! Shichinin no Idol) before venturing on to this series. It’s the prequel after all.And 12 episodes really is just like pouring oil into water. The end result isn’t pretty and neither is the overall direction of this show altogether. But for starters, Wake Up, Girls does a decent setup with its general concept a bit differently in some ways. Compared to some other idol theme series such as Idolmaster, Love Live, and Akb4008 Stage, WuG has a more realistic vibe. The main characters aren’t famous and in fact doesn’t seem different from your average day folks. They all come from different backgrounds and it takes some time for them to come together as a group with a united goal – to become a professional idol group for the world to recognize. The diversity could be perhaps something to expand on and one such character hold a more distinctive stand than others. Her name is Mayu and was recognized as a centerpiece figure in a former group she was once part of, the I-Club. Unlike them, WuG is more like a freshman. I-Club is not only their rival but also their senior as a group of experienced idols. What the show brings together is to see how WuG climbs a ladder to success in the entertainment industry. Against such a rival, that’s no pushover.Mayu is perhaps a character of various complexity. Most of this revolves around her past as a former member of I-Club. Her talent has earned the nickname ‘Mayushi’ where she also has a fanbase on the Internet. Yet, her decision to quit the group now has backlash from fans that invites insecurity to such attention. Regardless, Mayu still stands out as perhaps the most prominent character in WuG as the series explores her dynamics. But from basic perspective, it’s easy to cherry pick her present state of being. From her first encounter with WuG’S manager Kōhei Matsuda, one can tell that she no longer wishes to be an idol, at least in the entertainment field. So where does that lead her now? After some convincing, she does want to become an idol again but not without some tough love. There’s also an exploration of her persona and inner psyche at the surface level. But what the show doesn’t do right is dealing with how she copes with this and her seemingly resolve seems rushed. At the same time, some of her development lacks sympathy despite the feelings she tries to reach out to others. It may feel realistic on some stances but the way it conveys itself is lacking. On the other hand, her relationship with her mother can be relatable in some ways. Remember when your parents sometimes disagree with you on topics such as your future? Mayu’s scenario is not so different.Other characters comes from a variety of backgrounds although they all have the ambition to become an idol. A few of them stands out more than others such as Miyu and her hyperactive personality or Yoshino as a defacto leader with her experience. Unfortunately, not all of them get enough characterization as the show focuses on their path to their future, rather than their past. Only a few characters get spotlight with Mayu being the centerpiece. What that past does explore is the rivalry between her and Shiho, the current center spot of I-1 Club. Yet, that rivalry is frivolous and lacks impact on some aspects. Through the few encounters they have, it’s shown that I-1 Club always steps ahead. This should be no surprise considering their experience while WuG is more of a newbie. Still, their progress feels rushed and lacks integrity.What the series does have is realism, defined in a rather natural way especially for the idol group WuG. Most of them seems to stay themselves rather than trying to become someone who they are not. They also take their work seriously and have fun while at it. At the same time, they group develops a strong bond with each other despite the hardship of being an idol. There’s no competition among each other to see who is the best unlike Mayu’s past days as an idol in the I-1 Club. Everyone stays united and when life becomes tough, they look out after one another. There’s a certain appeal for WuG as well when they take the stage to please both the audience and people who supports them. The story itself also gets to the point right away rather than pushing buttons to drag itself. It’s important for a 1 cour show to focus on this aspect to truly and realistically show just how difficult it is to become an idol. It takes skill, determination, and integrity. WuG delivers that with the extensive training programs, their coach’s method of discipline, and rivalry with other idol groups. Even the audition will invite tension and make it realistically challenging to high degree of credibility. It’s a hard life out there.Animation wise, we get a moderate and average delivery. None of the characters stands out in any particular way with their character designs. They look simple and even the first episode has the idol group dance on stage in school uniforms, a classic of what you may see during childhood days. The Green Leaves Entertainment agency itself also seems to lack any distinctive features although it once again demonstrates credibility. Because it’s near bankruptcy, you’d expect a simple design and that’s what you’ll get. There’s also small bits of fan service that may be distracting but most of it isn’t depicted as shock value.As an idol theme show, soundtrack is a key element that empowers WuG. The music has a way to clearly describe itself as artistic with the enthusiasm. The downside is the rather repetitiveness the show seems to demonstrate with a lack of diversity in its songs. What the singing festival present lacks strength with how the song is performed. Fortunately, the OST finds itself to balance this with its well-coordinated tone. A quiet atmosphere with a small group of idols, the soundtrack creates realism from all angles. On the other hand, the OP song isn’t very easily to appreciate with its weak artistic features.WuG isn’t a show I’ll remember for long. Yet, it depicts more of a realistic way of how the entertainment industry works as being an idol and reach success is a very challenging task. It’s not a joke considering the minimum amount of comedy demonstrated by each episode. Yet, the girls of the group has that spirit, the dream to reach success as a group united by an ambition. Just don’t expect any deep enthralling story or strong character development as the show isn’t trying to write a tale of success. Rather, it tries to create a story of an idol life. Did it reach success? I’d say so-so. Directed by Yamaken, Wake Up, Girls is the first show he works on three years since Fractale.

But WUG! is a masterpiece of art, idol management and hype. Here are some facts about the WUG!:1. Every SINGLE one of the 7 main characters are completely new voice talents. For all of them this is their first major role. The one with the most experience is being train announcer in an another anime before this gig.2. All the main characters...shares their name pronunciation with their respective voice actresses (this only makes sense if you know some Japanese), and shares facial features with them too.3. The ""next week\'s preview"" segment shows the voice actresses in real life in the studio.The above facts translates to a direct attachment between the real life voice actresses and the characters they portray in the anime. As the group grows from a bunch of rag-tags to a solid idol unit you can not help but grow attached to them. The writers/managers clearly made this anime with the fullest intention of launching and promoting the idol group that is Wake Up, Girls!What is amazing is that they delivered. Whilst AKB0048 tried a fantasy approach to describing what being an idol is like, WUG! takes the full reality approach and lays it all out for all to see. Everything is of course a bit more exaggerated for drama but none so far-fetched that you can convince yourself that it will never happen in real life (though some may argue otherwise).I find it refreshing that they didn\'t go the ecchi route either and just turn it into yet another one of ""those"" animes. This lets the audience find the moe elements in the character\'s personality and character developments. There was one thing that i didn\'t like as much, and that was the costume designs, they were pretty ordinary.The songs from the movie, OP, ED, various other inserts are REALLY good. Watch them on a live performance on youtube if you don\'t believe me. At the end of the day, they\'re an idol unit, and idol unit make or breaks with their songs, unless you\'re AKB48, they can pretty much do anything they want and get away with it.Oh, and Hanazawa Kana (and lots of other big names also make cameo appearances).Overall, you can see that they went for a marketing ploy, giving rise to a new idol group through an anime, generating hype, interests, fanboys, and you know what, it worked for me. I thoroughly enjoyed WUG! as an anime and it made me want to pursue them as an idol group. shares their name pronunciation with their respective voice actresses (this only makes sense if you know some Japanese), and shares facial features with them too.3.

I thoroughly enjoyed WUG! as an anime and it made me want to pursue them as an idol group.', 'Nowadays, idol music groups are a firm part of otaku culture. So it doesn\'t really come off as a surprise that anime more and more includes idols as a theme as well - and it does it quite successful! Wake Up, Girls! is another anime that tries to hop on the moneymaking bandwagon of idol-focused series with a huge original project including a movie, a TV series and of course lots of music. So, how does Wake Up, Girls! (WUG from now on) compete with other popular idol anime series? Not too bad, I would say.While the 50-minute prequel movie (which you definitely should watch...before the series) focused on the auditions and the forming of the seven-member idol group Wake Up, Girls!, the TV series follows our idol group on the way to stardom. It\'s a basic plot, really - we watch them face various challenges, like difficult jobs and also struggles of individual members of the show. A key character in that case is Mayu Shimada, a former member of the extremely popular idol group I-1 Club, who is now a part of WUG and makes her a rival of I-1 Club.Over the 12 episodes a story of their rise from a small local idol group to a firm part of the most popular groups of Japan is told, and as WUG is an original production, we luckily get treated with a pretty satisfying conclusion.The way the story progresses is cliché in lots of ways - typical tropes get used, things like an injury before an important appeareance, tragic backstories and of course the power of friendship. Some of the clichés seem annoying, others you don\'t mind. While the whole progress of the story is cliché itself too, you still find yourself cheering for the girls somehow and hope for their best. The story may not be perfect - but for what it\'s trying to be, I think WUG does present it\'s story rather solidly.The main characters are presented quite decently too. As we have 7 main characters in a 12-episode show, it is not easy to develop much, but for that it\'s doing pretty well. We get some insight at backstories and individual struggles of the girls some episodes in. At the beginning though, you might have a bit of trouble relating to the characters, or even differentiate between them (which is also due to the same-face-syndrome which is present in the series). But when we actually get to see the development, we more and more feel with the characters and also cheer for them at some point. The side characters are rather irrelevant to the story though. Matsuda and the president Junko are completely useless, only the songwriter Hayasaka and I-1 as rivals are somewhat important. But the side characters barely are focused on anyways, so it\'s not that bothersome.I usually don\'t put that much focus on music, but since WUG is an idol show, music obviously plays a huge part. And I have to say, it delivers! As typical for idol groups, WUG is filled with J-Pop songs that are absolutely catchy and quite enjoyable. I think it influences the enjoyment too, as the good songs influence that you cheer for WUG more and more. For their first voice-acting and singing job, I think the voice actors do their job quite well.On the art and animation - I loved the character designs (even despite the same-face-syndrome), and the sceneries were pretty too. The animation was rather average though - it was rather inconsistent and lots of quality issues were visible.So, is Wake Up, Girls! a good idol anime? To summarize my thoughts - even though it is not good enough to be considered a ""classic"" in the music anime genre, for a one-time watch it is quite fun indeed, and the songs are enjoyable too.

This results in my final score 7/10.', 'This is a series that attempts to showcase what true idols are like, it does so fairly well by using characters who are not particularly talented aside from a few who have some singing experience or dancing experience. Doing this allowed the series to focus on the hardships they faced as they practice as well as the hardships of trying to draw a crowd of fans despite their lack of talent which served the show very well. All 7 girls got a chance to have their personal lives expanded on during the series which is a good thing to see for a short show like...this, and it was handled well compared to a similar show. The art was fairly basic, but served the show fairly enough, and looked good during their dance scenes. The music might have been the best aspect of the series, it was upbeat and enjoyable, yet simple and easy to have stuck in your head. For a 12 episode show, it was wholly enjoyable, and with any luck a second season will happen allowing more WUG to be enjoyed in the future. this, and it was handled well compared to a similar show.

I started watching it shortly after Love Live! School Idol Project Season 2 ended, and I was upset. I love idols, especially the concept and realization of them. To see a group of girls save their school, as well as win the national championship was the feel good story I needed. Love Live! ended on a really depressing, positive note and I wanted more.Enter Wake Up, Girls! A story not of...amazing triumph, but the tribulations that come with it. The opening scene of a nervous group of girls, performing their heart out. Then you realize, there’s only a few people in the audience. Each member carries a heavy backstory, few are marked with privilege like the members of μ’s. Mayu, a washed up idol who caused the decline of her parent’s wealth and relationship, or Kaya, who left home after her childhood friend went missing at sea and her depression was too much to bear. The drama and struggles are so real and relatable it hurts. You want them to be happy and you want them to succeed.I know I keep comparing it to Love Live! but I can’t help it. There’s no other relative show like it. Idolm@ster wasn’t really that music based, as odd as that sounds. The stories are relatively parallel between WUG and Love Live! but here’s my final thought on Wake Up, Girls!, yes, yes to everything. Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt. On my recent visit to Anime Expo, Yamamoto Yutaka (the director and producer of WUG) gave a quick Q & A and he mentioned that the only real reason that WUG was given a green light was the idea of small town dreamers in a place like Sendai, could work hard enough to get there. And it’s true. You see every step of the music process (sort of) with Wake Up, Girls! From the production company booking jobs, to spending countless hours practicing, even hiring writers to write their songs. Love Live! had, well, Maki, allegedly writing and recording full pop songs and Kotori designing outfits.As much as I love Love Live!, watching a serious idol show was such a great change of pace and I really wish somewhere in the future, we can get another OVA showing the aftermath, or another season. amazing triumph, but the tribulations that come with it.

The characters were interchangeable, the music (except for the ending theme) was mediocre, and there wasn't even enough of it for a solid idol show.  Also, the dramatic backstories and attempts at plot devices fell flat on their faces for most of the show.  The last three episodes were a huge step up in the show's quality, and saved its score from being very bad.  If you liked AKB0048, Love Live, or Idolmaster, you're better off watching those and skipping this show. "", ""So. Wake Up Girls! Let me set this clear first before I continue with this review, this is my first idol show that I've watched (TV series one at least) and as such I had pretty much no expectations of it whatsoever.My first impressions of this anime (after watching the 7 Idols movie) was that it was a surprisingly realistic anime that wasn't sugercoated. And the show carried that throughout in terms of plot.Story: 10/10Art: 8/10Sound: 8/10Character: 10/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 9/10...Plot wise, this story is amazing. It shows the trials of a small and upcoming idol group that struggles with internal and external disputes. It also shows how each character/idol has her own problems and how they work to overcome them. It's a really moving story in that sense.Art wise, it's... nice. There's all there is to it. It wasn't bad by any means, nor did I find it particularly spectacular. The animations were a little rough around the edges, but that kind of made the art style what it was. I like it that way.Same goes for the sound.Character wise, it was interesting to see the characters grow. There wasn't a significant amount of change, but the idols in particular did undergo changes in themselves as a result of the stress of being an idol and interacting with each other. I really enjoyed seeing that.Overall enjoyment was a 9 because well I cringed mostly when watching this because of how realistic I felt the plot was. I wasn't prepared for that, but maybe I've been watching too many flowery shows. Who knows. But besides that it was a really really good show worth watching. Recommend it if you want a more realistic and serious plot as compared to flowery anime.Hope that I helped someone decide whether or not they're gonna pick up this series.

It is entertaining, funny and the characters’ lifelike interactions are delightful to watch, which comes as no surprise, from an anime which has broken so many records. The songs are of high quality both melodically and vocally, and there is ample character development as we watch the girls struggle to save their school and train to become school idols.Story-wise, I find it to be lacking in...this department compared to WUG. There is a lot of sugar-coating, which makes it difficult to appreciate as a realistic idol anime. Pretty and talented girls dancing and singing cheerfully in flamboyant costumes is something which the idol industry wants us to see. How the industry really is is hidden from us and we are all aware of that fact. Why are we still watching idol animes and concerts when we know what’s happening?It’s because deep down, we have a selfishness that is nurtured and fostered by a capitalistic and individualistic society. We tend to care for ourselves primarily and nothing is further from the truth. Do we attend concerts to gratify ourselves or to truly appreciate the artistes and their talents? What comes first? Is it myself or others? No doubt, many will not admit to this and this is why the idol industry is still booming as we bask in the melodies of their bubblegum pop.When I watched the first episode of WUG, I initially thought that what it was doing was tantamount to suicide, killing off its own self and deterring its potential fans. After all, which idol fan wants to see him or her as a contributing factor to an industry where there is cut-throat competition and girls are subjected to constant and arduous training to perform well for their fans? No one does. What we want to see are stories of girls following their dreams and singing upbeat songs to get us on our feet.This very aspect which brings WUG down, exposing the harsh realities of the idol industry and life, how idols become idols is also responsible for garnering its following. WUG is not afraid to shame and humble itself by delivering hard hitting-truths despite being an idol anime at its core. This very delicate balance of trying to present itself as an idol anime yet in a way, reflecting on real-world problems and discouraging the viewer from supporting it is what really makes it stand out.The standard of animation and some say, music in WUG may not be as high as that of Love Live’s but the lessons it holds are priceless and invaluable.

Going into this series was really hard, the main reason is because it was always cringe for me from episode 1-12. The wake Up Girls try to get popular and work them selfs to the top. This is the part that annoyed me. Every time they go on stage or do something idol related, they always fail in some way leading to cringe. I feel the need to skip scenes all the time because of this. At the first stage performance of the anime, it was horrible and couldn\'t be anymore disapointed....Especially when they used bikini\'s... it was not fan service or a good performance in my eyes, it was entirely cringe... just looking at them thinking they were doing good was even more cringe.The flaw in this anime in my eyes is the lack of balance. The balance of going through bad and good times. That goes with success and failure too. Not going to name individual music anime but balancing that out could of improved my rating and thoughts of the anime. Honestly though, who would always want to see failures and depressed faces ( if u watched idol Jihen then u would know what I mean even more). Anyway this is the area that made me cringe every episode, no great moments on stage until the last few episodes and just absolutely embarrassing themselves. I mean this quite seriously, they were annoying AF.Moving away from the bad sides of the anime, I will dedicate this paragraph to the good points (thank me). First, From only being local unknown idols they went through some god-like development to get into the finals in episode 12. They didn\'t get as much training as their opponents but that was without a doubt inevitable, you will understand when if you watch it. Improving after failures is supposedly a good point but there\'s also a point for how much a watcher can handle these fails. Moving fowards towards their dreams when they hit slumps and get into fights, that was probably difficult for them but they didn\'t ever give up ( looked like some nearly did though) so I give them credit for dedication and motivation.The characters in this were sometimes just ""no good"", like for instance crap directors who look like they are just trying to show the idols bad sides. The art was nothing special but a few face designs made me think for a few moments thinking stuff like,""what\'s up with that chin outline but we all get that like for Occultic Nine. The sound was the best thing I enjoyed about the anime, the lives and the music in general is good.With that all said, no anime can be perfect so if your going to watch this then prepare for the things I said. This is all my thoughts so it may differ with your views. Allow me to take some more of your time to give you a review based on how the anime is in general not based on my likes and what not.Its not a garbage anime at all, if anything it has high potential. It improved and did a great job with making the watchers emotion go wild. Its definitely worth the watch but its not a steady ship with no waves, it\'s a rocky ship at night during a storm. Either way you end up at the destination of your desire. So we are going to take the route of hardships and watching over the troubled idols but it\'s still entertaining in the end.I\'m ending this review here, please keep my review in mind if your planning to watch it.

Hope I helped.', ""I actually wanted to watch this since it came out during its seasonal airing. But, I decided that I would watch it later.Wake Up, Girls! is another idol anime, produced by Ordet and under the direction of the infamous Yamamoto Yutaka.Before its 12-episode anime, there is a movie to be watched first. I really, really recommend that you watch the movie because it shows how the idol group under the same anime name, “Wake Up, Girls!” (WUG), started. In the anime series, the group faces problematic situations, and it tries to manage and keep it going.Sadly, the story didn’t shine really well among other idol...anime. I would say that there are a lot of clichéd moments, especially during the introductory movie. Also, there’s a lot of idea repetition among members of the group and it really gets annoying hearing from them.I really hated the first two episodes, because it sudden introduces fan-service, which I felt that it shouldn't be included. However, it needed to be in just for the context of the story. sigh…Despite the mediocre story, it still have some positive points in the anime. I like how the story sets around 2013-2014. It even made references to real life events, such as the tragic earthquake and tsunami in the Tohoku region, although the anime don’t really focus much on it. Also, the group managed to work their way up to something spectacular, which I think is the best moment in the anime.I question myself how scary is the idol industry in Japan. The anime showed another bigger and successful idol group, called the I-1. Watching them suffer really irk me. Would such methods from the group be similar to some idol groups in Japan? That’s where reality prove otherwise.I would say that all the characters in the idol group are varied. Each of them have their own qualities and personality. They have their own reasons to why they want to be an idol, and I find (most of) them quite sweet. Some of them have interesting background which affect who they are.Character development is okay. I would say some of them continued on after their struggle, thanks to someone else. Overall, I think the group did develop since its formation. And of course, there has to be one character that was from another idol group. Thanks, clichéd anime!Animation is good, but not great. Starting from the characters, I would say the idols have the same freaking face. Also, there is inconsistent drawing of the characters, making them out of their body shape. The character design is fine, except the awkward hair colour choices. The facial expressions from the characters are nice. The scenery is good-looking, but not special. Also, I like how the performances is mostly 2D-drawn, instead of 3D-rendered.Although it is an idol anime, I would say music isn’t heavily focused in it. I was a bit disappointed, because I know there are other idol anime that lots of songs sung by the respective idol groups or even solo acts. But still, I love the songs sung by the group. The OPs and ED are sung by the group and they are awesome in their own ways. The background music is fine. Voice acting is okay, but very few voices just don’t really match the characters well.So, have I enjoyed Wake Up, Girls! like any other idol anime?My answer would be “only the last few episodes”. The other episodes bore me to sleep (yes, I did sleep when marathoning it) due to the cliché the anime gets all the time. I think the anime really tried its best to be a good one, but honestly I doubt so.I think I'm the type of person who enjoy more on the glee side of the idol industry, instead of the seriousness. Hence, I would recommend this anime only to people who enjoy idols a lot. anime. I would say that there are a lot of clichéd moments, especially during the introductory movie.

Hence, I would recommend this anime only to people who enjoy idols a lot."", ""People ask me very often: what is your favorite idols anime.OK, I’d like to live in peace with myself, so I’m going to answer to my imaginary friends.Firstly, I’m not familiar with the idols culture, I don’t understand it, but I really like idols-anime, it’s a piece of sterilized happiness, straightforward success with songs and dances. Suddenly Wake Up Girls is not an idol anime. It’s an anime about everything, about friendship, about success and failure, even about idols, they’re shown as antagonists and, of course, it’s about weird potatoes, y’know.But the fact is this is the best, so let’s begin.1. Plot. Score: Canonical.A small...agency in the small village named Sendai is looted by a big corporation of enterprising idols i-1. The agency director decided to hire seven idols to defend their village. They recruit one experienced idol, four average idols and one half-idol, eventually they succeed in hiring an pro-level idol and are ready to protect their village. Oops, I think I made a detour, everyone knows this tale, we don’t need to spend time on it.1. Story. Score: Magnificent.The story in WUG isn’t straight, but easy to follow. It explains the problems, it doesn’t have dead ends and avoids inconsistency. It doesn’t spend your time to focus on unnecessary things or details that have no further development. The good things is that they not only tell you a story, but also show it. Every word has a proof, so if someone doesn’t have enough skill we can see it in a dance, but without comic situation when someone is so clumsy that he can’t use the stairs without risk (sorry Haruka, sad but true). WUG narrates the story very well, we can see how character skills are growing, as they train, they have a problems, they can literally bump into each other in a dance, take wrong position, but they work on it day to day.WUG’s story moves characters up, then drops down for the sake of rising again. It has some standard idolmovies thingies like person who doesn’t give up, person with another goal in life and so on. But it’s appropriate and, to be honest, sometimes it’s unexpected. On the other hand, the world around is more realistic, it means they don’t have to explain how this world works, but they have to show how these girls solve their problems. It’s not so easy without common useful tricks like a rich member in the band or completely filled performance schedule without any reasons or the magic from Love Live that makes everything they imagine appear. It isn’t good or bad, these are the different ways to show character development. Thus it allows us to better understand the actions of every character.2. Characters. Score: Amazing.Foremost, they don’t have Nico Nico Nee. (It doesn’t mean I hate Nico. I don’t hate anyone, even Honda Mio). They don’t have a green eye`d noone, a noone from another world, a noone who has a talkative hamsters (you know).And again. Seven different personalities from the real world. But creating different characters isn’t enough. A character shouldn’t be static, only development of a character makes it real, only relations between them makes us believe in them. From the beginning someone is shy, someone is funny, someone doesn’t fit the level and ready to give up, someone has a different goal in life, someone has a bad story in a past. What is the real pleasure is how all of them communicate to each other. Of course Yoppi is a leader, Mayu is the first star of the band, Airi simply is Airi, it looks like these trio has a little bit more time than other, but it doesn’t mean the other characters are merely playing the supporting roles only. It’s a real pleasure watching their interactions between the team members. It’s very important, nobody has a favorite, however Mayu and Airi are friends, but Nanami helps Airi with trainings after her day off, Kaya has a private talk with Mayu, consequently it causes a response action later, because every step is has reasons.However, a couple of words about each person in chaotic order.Airi. The weakest, the person who wants to be an idol not because it’s her real feeling, but only because her relations with Mayu. She can’t imagine anything different by herself because of her uncertainty. She’s not talented, she’s uncertain, she doubts herself. She’s hardworking, but it’s not enough to be in the same level with the others. But the main reason of her having a part in the movie isn’t her personality, but her relations with other band members. In these relations she’s a kinda conscience. At the end she believes in all other girls more than everyone else and, unfortunately, much more than in herself. Her animation is truly unbelievable, i.e. during their debut gig she misses the beat frequently, at least twice. It’s not so obvious, it’s not at focus, the movie doesn’t make your your eyes linger on it, but it works through subconsciousness, proving the words they’re talking about as a fact.Mayu, the star, the center of common admiration, she raises awareness to the band. She’s kind, responsive, but because of her problems in the past she doesn’t want to get close with anyone, except Airi at the beginning. She’s really talented, but somehow she lost her target, so her main goal is to find herself and understand what the idols world means specially for her.Yoshino, officially she’s a leader of this band, but she avoids making decision, because she’s not sure of her own solution. Her first resolution proving her a true captain happens only when she understands, it's not only her demands, but the whole band answer. Her skills are really high, so she envies Mayu occasionally, they have a confrontation until they understand they have the same goal.Kaya sometimes looks impulsive and even silly, especially after her first introduction, but the reason of her behavior is her sense of justice. She’s crazy in her own little way, it’s true, but she knows what responsibility is, she’s really like the band, so she could make more than expected and could put up with accidents she has never allowed before, her attitude to WUG is clear from her words: “if this were one of my jobs I’d have quit a long time ago”. It’s absolutely clear only she could pull out all fears from Mayu’s mind and resolve understatements.Next two persons don’t have a good story arc, world isn’t perfect, even the world of Wake Up Girls universe. They show the current air in a band via reaction, so if they’re tired we can see if it is OK or not.Miyu. Twin tailed and incompetent, it’s her own explanation of herself and it’s partially true. Not in the case of incompetence, but in the case of honesty. Sometimes she’s the first person who’s ready to react, while others in a reflection. She can switch attention with a joke or some unimportant sentences, what allows to relax if it requires. She’s responsible for quick changes in others' mood.Minami is the same character, may be she’s more stable than Miyu who’s really prone to crying. But she’s ready to share the most valuable thing if she thinks it can help.Kouhei Matsuda. Initially he’s looks like an anonymous manager-san from The Idolmaster, but his explanation is such funny, it’s started from a daydreamer lying on the bench and thinking about … simply thinking. His faults are totally embarrassing for the band members, but they support him anyway. He isn’t the best manager, but he’s a member of the band after all.Nanami. Oh boy, my adorable Nanami. What an amazing character she is. She trained hard with everyone, she helped Airi, and after that in private talks with Kouhei announced her departure from the band and went to a cafe with everybody as if nothing had happened. And when the decision is made, her next step is “the hell with it, I’m staying here”. She’s clever, skillful and canny and she is impulsive and sensitive. She’s really self-confident, she knows her own worth and somehow she’s kind and tender.Digressing from the subject, I want to mention: returning of Nanami one day is the most unexpected expected scene for me and it shows the real development of characters.It is worth paying attention to visual introduction of every person as a new band member. Airi tells tells Mayu about it and apologized. Kaya opens the letter in the small closed storeroom, Nanami has taken the pass for granted and starts to picking up her outfit, Minami and Miyu are celebrated with supporters and I’m not sure Yoppi had seen her offer before her photo session was started. Different behavior almost without words. Is this one minute of a different short actions add much more extra capacity to a a person rather than explaining their behavior through personal story? The same things in audition: someone preparing (fyi Nanami), someone is relaxing, someone is nervous (guess who).3. Music. Score: FascinatingI’m afraid all songs in this genre are similar, sometime it’s a little bit better, sometime worse. I beg your pardon, but my favorite song from the all idols songs is “Baby!” from AoButa. All other songs sounds similar for me. WUG’s songs is not so pathetical like Love Live’s ones, but not as naïve as the Idolmaster’s. It’s important that this is the songs girls can sing and dance on a stage. Anyway it’s very difficult to be objective in estimating the songs' value here, when I listen to it, I associate it with the universe and get pleasure from it.Background music is well, not boring, not distracting and very appropriate. It provides you with a real mood in a key moments. It’s perfect.4. Art. Score: InimitableFor me the worst dance in idol movies is any dance from Love Live Sunshine. They say there are some good graphics there, but I see only chaotic movement with shaped model against the static background from random angles. It’s suxx. To be honest I’m not familiar with art estimating, but I’m very meticulous about the small tricks. In the first movie they show Mayu in the past shining in the colorful stage with sparkling eyes and later in the next frame she’s sitting in the monochrome class with her hair casting a shadow on her eyes. It’s a perfect work. It really makes a difference. It’s not the only one moment, there are lots of them, I like the moment, when the band members are going home after the first training with Hayasaka-san, everyone is really tired, they stoop as they walk, Mayu is following them without any problems. It explains the situation better than thousand words. It’s a real art for me, not the frame per second race or quantity of leaves on the tree in the background. Frankly graphics is cheap, but the animation is perfect.WUG’s dances is near the first Love Live, just for me it’s the best quality I’ve waited for. Herewith, Tachiagare in the ending of the first movie is the best dance I’ve ever seen. It’s a fact that technically Chika dance is better, but I’m not talking about technical details, cute movements and some other tricks without context. It’s all in one, the mood, the graphics, the music. This dance is the real show of themselves, their faith and confidence. This dance means “All is lost save honour”.Summary. Score: OutstandingI don’t know why this series is estimated so low, it might be the wrong targeting. I found it while looking up for idols anime, but this is not the idol movie, I think it’s less idol-anime than Zombieland Saga. If I had to find something similar, I could mention “Sora yori mo Tooi Basho” or “Hibike Euphonium”, these stories have much more in common, than, probably, any other names from the review. But the difference is too big too, these two story I have mentioned are optimistic and full of happiness, this story is melancholic and kinda sad, but it gives hope.My opinion is very subjective, it looks like this world touched my heart. It’s up to you to decide, if you should spend time on it or not. The first movie is about one hour, it follows three episode rule. \xa0In the best case you find something to watch, in the worst case you don’t. Anyway, if you are reading this you are already interested in it, aren’t you?Ps dedicated to Wake Up Girls band disbanding in the March of 2019 agency in the small village named Sendai is looted by a big corporation of enterprising idols i-1.

She’s hardworking, but it’s not enough to be in the same level with the others. But the main reason of her having a part in the movie isn’t her personality, but her relations with other band members. In these relations she’s a kinda conscience. At the end she believes in all other girls more than everyone else and, unfortunately, much more than in herself. Her animation is truly unbelievable, i.e. during their debut gig she misses the beat frequently, at least twice. It’s not so obvious, it’s not at focus, the movie doesn’t make your your eyes linger on it, but it works through subconsciousness, proving the words they’re talking about as a fact.Mayu, the star, the center of common admiration, she raises awareness to the band. She’s kind, responsive, but because of her problems in the past she doesn’t want to get close with anyone, except Airi at the beginning. She’s really talented, but somehow she lost her target, so her main goal is to find herself and understand what the idols world means specially for her.Yoshino, officially she’s a leader of this band, but she avoids making decision, because she’s not sure of her own solution. Her first resolution proving her a true captain happens only when she understands, it's not only her demands, but the whole band answer. Her skills are really high, so she envies Mayu occasionally, they have a confrontation until they understand they have the same goal.Kaya sometimes looks impulsive and even silly, especially after her first introduction, but the reason of her behavior is her sense of justice. She’s crazy in her own little way, it’s true, but she knows what responsibility is, she’s really like the band, so she could make more than expected and could put up with accidents she has never allowed before, her attitude to WUG is clear from her words: “if this were one of my jobs I’d have quit a long time ago”. It’s absolutely clear only she could pull out all fears from Mayu’s mind and resolve understatements.Next two persons don’t have a good story arc, world isn’t perfect, even the world of Wake Up Girls universe. They show the current air in a band via reaction, so if they’re tired we can see if it is OK or not.Miyu. Twin tailed and incompetent, it’s her own explanation of herself and it’s partially true. Not in the case of incompetence, but in the case of honesty. Sometimes she’s the first person who’s ready to react, while others in a reflection. She can switch attention with a joke or some unimportant sentences, what allows to relax if it requires. She’s responsible for quick changes in others' mood.Minami is the same character, may be she’s more stable than Miyu who’s really prone to crying. But she’s ready to share the most valuable thing if she thinks it can help.Kouhei Matsuda. Initially he’s looks like an anonymous manager-san from The Idolmaster, but his explanation is such funny, it’s started from a daydreamer lying on the bench and thinking about … simply thinking. His faults are totally embarrassing for the band members, but they support him anyway. He isn’t the best manager, but he’s a member of the band after all.Nanami. Oh boy, my adorable Nanami. What an amazing character she is. She trained hard with everyone, she helped Airi, and after that in private talks with Kouhei announced her departure from the band and went to a cafe with everybody as if nothing had happened. And when the decision is made, her next step is “the hell with it, I’m staying here”. She’s clever, skillful and canny and she is impulsive and sensitive. She’s really self-confident, she knows her own worth and somehow she’s kind and tender.Digressing from the subject, I want to mention: returning of Nanami one day is the most unexpected expected scene for me and it shows the real development of characters.It is worth paying attention to visual introduction of every person as a new band member. Airi tells tells Mayu about it and apologized. Kaya opens the letter in the small closed storeroom, Nanami has taken the pass for granted and starts to picking up her outfit, Minami and Miyu are celebrated with supporters and I’m not sure Yoppi had seen her offer before her photo session was started. Different behavior almost without words. Is this one minute of a different short actions add much more extra capacity to a a person rather than explaining their behavior through personal story? The same things in audition: someone preparing (fyi Nanami), someone is relaxing, someone is nervous (guess who).3. Music. Score: FascinatingI’m afraid all songs in this genre are similar, sometime it’s a little bit better, sometime worse. I beg your pardon, but my favorite song from the all idols songs is “Baby!” from AoButa. All other songs sounds similar for me. WUG’s songs is not so pathetical like Love Live’s ones, but not as naïve as the Idolmaster’s. It’s important that this is the songs girls can sing and dance on a stage. Anyway it’s very difficult to be objective in estimating the songs' value here, when I listen to it, I associate it with the universe and get pleasure from it.Background music is well, not boring, not distracting and very appropriate. It provides you with a real mood in a key moments. It’s perfect.4. Art. Score: InimitableFor me the worst dance in idol movies is any dance from Love Live Sunshine. They say there are some good graphics there, but I see only chaotic movement with shaped model against the static background from random angles. It’s suxx. To be honest I’m not familiar with art estimating, but I’m very meticulous about the small tricks. In the first movie they show Mayu in the past shining in the colorful stage with sparkling eyes and later in the next frame she’s sitting in the monochrome class with her hair casting a shadow on her eyes. It’s a perfect work. It really makes a difference. It’s not the only one moment, there are lots of them, I like the moment, when the band members are going home after the first training with Hayasaka-san, everyone is really tired, they stoop as they walk, Mayu is following them without any problems. It explains the situation better than thousand words. It’s a real art for me, not the frame per second race or quantity of leaves on the tree in the background. Frankly graphics is cheap, but the animation is perfect.WUG’s dances is near the first Love Live, just for me it’s the best quality I’ve waited for. Herewith, Tachiagare in the ending of the first movie is the best dance I’ve ever seen. It’s a fact that technically Chika dance is better, but I’m not talking about technical details, cute movements and some other tricks without context. It’s all in one, the mood, the graphics, the music. This dance is the real show of themselves, their faith and confidence. This dance means “All is lost save honour”.Summary. Score: OutstandingI don’t know why this series is estimated so low, it might be the wrong targeting. I found it while looking up for idols anime, but this is not the idol movie, I think it’s less idol-anime than Zombieland Saga. If I had to find something similar, I could mention “Sora yori mo Tooi Basho” or “Hibike Euphonium”, these stories have much more in common, than, probably, any other names from the review. But the difference is too big too, these two story I have mentioned are optimistic and full of happiness, this story is melancholic and kinda sad, but it gives hope.My opinion is very subjective, it looks like this world touched my heart. It’s up to you to decide, if you should spend time on it or not. The first movie is about one hour, it follows three episode rule. \xa0In the best case you find something to watch, in the worst case you don’t. Anyway, if you are reading this you are already interested in it, aren’t you?Ps dedicated to Wake Up Girls band disbanding in the March of 2019"", 'Note: This is my first time writing a review. It might be biased but hear me out before asking why. Also, I tried my best to be an obedient chap and followed the guidelines so it should not contain any spoilers whatsoever.Writing this in 2016 wants me to say this: This is the future.Wake Up, Girls! is this kind of idol anime that started from literally nothing into something. It\'s about seven girls aiming for a spotlight at Tokyo\'s booming idol industry. And so I rate.Story: 8/10While I enjoy watching this without watching the prequel movie first, this anime is something that will make you...think. ""Is this how AKB started? Is this how the folks at 765 Pro and 346 Pro started? Why is it so different from any idol anime currently available on this time and age?"" A journey of seven girls and a (startup?) production company will literally take you to a journey that will make you feel like you\'re a part of it. They might not be school idols saving the school from closing, but they will definitely save themselves from quitting being an idol.Art: 7/10While I\'m still in it, the fact that the story was great doesn\'t mean the artwork was good. I haven\'t watched the TV release, so I heavily relied on BD\'s I have. I think the same problem on every anime remains: when the character is away, the animators have the tendency to minimize the drawings on the background, making the characters at the back look like stick drawings with color in it. And it\'s still there at the Blu-rays. Nevertheless, the colors were nice, and the right colors were shaded on the parts that it requires it so well, you might think of it as an anime released during Summer 2016 (I\'m looking at you, ufotable.)Sound: 9/10I expected the ED to be an upbeat, but instead it\'s a melodic song that will instinctively tell you that ""these idols might be graduating from WUG!"", or something like that. The OP got me, though. ""7 Girls\' War"" is something to be looked upon. It\'s an upbeat song that will make you feel like you\'re watching Lucky Star! or something similar that has a bubbly, kawaii and moe plot along the way. But, it\'s common knowledge to viewers that their song, ""Tachiagare!"" stands out the most. The moment I laid my ears on this song, I instantly knew that I\'m into a great, great cruise while watching the series. I wish for them to create more songs that will stand out among all idol animated series for a long time.Character: 8/10I rate the character like this because the development of the characters were explained and shown properly, even for me who haven\'t watched the prequel beforehand, which is quite impressive. Folks might not understand the first few episodes, but as it progresses, you will realize how they struggled to reach their goal: Kouhaku Uta Gassen (in reference to White vs. Red that some of them are talking about). I wish for them to reach it someday. That aside, the drama, and their struggles had made a solid impression that they are not just your everyday idols. They are someone to admire for, and someone that will inspire someone to aim high no matter how hard the stones life has been throwing at you. ""Eh, but isn\'t that kind of biased? Anyone can do better than that, right?"": It isn\'t. This is a genuine struggle. This is life teaching you how to dream, and how to achieve that dream. I\'ve never seen such anime series executed the same wave of drama before, and it surely hits home whenever I recall some parts of it.Enjoyment: 10/10Of course, it\'s an idol anime, after all. And that all idol anime must be enjoyable no matter how they executed it. (Remember that I\'m writing this in 2016, so.) Love Live! might make you laugh and cry, but it will never have the same enjoyment as Wake Up, Girls!. It\'s been written in such a way it will distinguish itself from the rest of the anime universe for quite a long time until it fades from the spotlight. It is, truly, a worth of a watch. And worth of a journey too, when you\'re at it. It isn\'t your world-class entertainment, but it\'s your everyday entertainment that you will enjoy every day.Overall: 9/10This is the future. It might be underrated today but I\'m sure that they will make it bigger in the future. With the right formula and charisma, I\'m sure of it. I will keep watch until the end, since I finally found an idol anime worthy of laying my life upon.They will make big. If they don\'t, the fans will make it happen. ""Let\'s do our best!

Wake up, Girls!""', ""Every now and then, I decide to take a break from watching seasonal anime to watch non-seasonals instead. The non-seasonal anime that I decided to watch this time was Wake Up, Girls! because of a certain voice actress called Tanaka Minami. However, even though I did decide to watch this anime mainly because of her, the anime proved to be quite enjoyable to watch. Seeing the main characters growing to become a semi-professional idol unit from their very small beginnings did make me warm inside.Story:The story has good pacing. Even though most of the episodes showcases a story of a different girl, it also...has its own story development. The group, Wake Up Girls(WUG) starts off almost as a dysfunctional unit and has many difficulties initially, but as the anime progresses, WUG gains more popularity and becomes more cohesive unit. However, they also faced countless difficulties along the way, including clashes within the group, members facing the grueling task of coming to terms with their past and the group struggling to get the hang of the songs that they were given. In the end, they overcame the obstacles and emerged as a fascinating and exciting idol group. One great aspect of the show is the way it manages to create suspense at the end of every episode. It keeps the viewer glued to his seat wanting to know what will happen in the next episode. However, the show can also be dull at times which may bore the viewer watching it.Rating: 7/10Animation:I was quite impressed with the way the choreography was animated but at the same time, I was quite put off with the mediocre character animations which look like they've been butchered at times.Rating: 6/10Music:Catchy opening, especially the first opening Tachiagare. In addition, the various songs that the group sang were also groovy to listen to.Rating: 8/10CharacterThe anime has great character development as each character has different personalities. In addition, the anime gave great backstory coverage of the main girls.Each girl has her own struggle to overcome, with the main girl Mayu having to come with terms with her past with her old agency I-1, while Airi had to overcome her lack of talent with pure hard work and perseverance. I was especially impressed by how Mayu was able to come to terms with her past, overcome it and become the idol that she wanted to become. If I were to share my favorite character of the anime, it's a hard decision, because I love both Mayu and Minami. Initially, Minami caught my eyes because of her bubbly personality and cute voice but as the series progressed, I became impressed with Mayu's determination to prevail over her past and become the idol that she wished to become in the beginning. For that, I have to say that Mayu is my favorite character of the series.Rating: 7.5/10Overall, Wake Up, Girls! is a quality idol anime. Not only does it have an interesting  and suspenseful story, it also has quality character development and excellent music! If you're not put off by the sometimes sub-par animation, Wake Up, Girls! is a stellar idol anime to watch!Final rating: 7/10 has its own story development.

As an idol show, it makes an attempt to do something new, which makes it quite a refreshing take on the genre. And while it does succeed at a lot of things, the show is also pulled down by some others.Story:(+) A more realistic take on the idol industry(+) Interesting overarching story(+) Likeable characters(+) Excellent pacing(-) Underdeveloped characters...(-) Cliched near the endArt:(+) Non-CGI dance sequences look good for the most part(-) Characters almost look the same(-) Animation quality fluctuates from terrible to decentSound:(+) Catchy songs(+) Good voice acting for the most part(-) Song selection is low compared to idol shows like ""Idolm@ster"" and ""Love Live""(-) Matsuda\'s voice can get on your nerves (although this may just be my opinion)Character:(+) Characters are likable(+) Backstories are convincing and relatable(-) Not enough screen time on certain charactersRemarks:This show was a surprisingly good idol anime. Of course, as mentioned earlier, the animation quality tends to fluctuate and the story occasionally misses its mark.

As a matter of fact, I would say that ""Wake Up, Girls!"" is more or less the ""Idolm@ster"" in terms of the concept of an underdog idol agency crawling to the top.At the time of this writing, the real life Wake Up, Girls! group is on a live tour.

I am hoping for a second season, as this show has a lot of potential.8/10', 'Recently, there has been a flood of idol-related anime. These shows usually follow the tried-and-true ""new idols struggling to make it big"" formula. Among these, the two most popular seem to be The IDOLM@STER (IM@S) and Love Live! (LL) (and to a lesser extent, AKB0048). I strongly believe Wake Up, Girls! (WUG) has the potential to join these other properties to become another great idol anime series, but some flaws hold it back. Throughout this review I will be mentioning IM@S and LL as points of comparison to WUG because it is unavoidable that this show will be compared to its more well-known brethren.Story: 8/10The...story follows a newly-formed idol group called Wake Up, Girls! and its struggles to gain recognition first in its native Sendai region, and then in all of Japan. The story is truly one of this anime\'s strongest points. Unlike IM@S, in which most of the girls seemed born ready to be idols, the WUG girls each have their weaknesses, past histories, relationships, and other problems to deal with and overcome before they could truly become great idols. Even up to the last episodes, it was not a happy-go-lucky, rainbows-everywhere type of story.Of the 3 idol series, the struggles of WUG are the harshest and most realistic. Moreover, throughout the series there is the looming threat of the I-1 idol group, the best group in the nation that is clearly superior to WUG in almost every way. Our protagonists have to overcome this threat, which is much more menacing than any antagonist in the other series. As such, the viewers can really sympathize with the girls and the burdens on their shoulders.Note that there is a movie out that explains the origins of WUG, but the movie is only supplementary; it is not necessary to watch that before watching the series.Art: 5/10The art is honestly the biggest flaw of WUG. Compared to IM@S and LL, the dance animations are mediocre at best, and it was clear the animation budget was not as big as those of its rival shows. It didn\'t help that the character designs were not very unique, either. This might have been the show trying to keep the character appearances as realistic as possible, but ultimately it was a detriment to the series, as it was very hard to keep track of who was who when every girl looked the same.Sound: 7/10With a catchy OP and even better emotional ED, the music of this series was solid. Unfortunately, maybe due to the budget yet again, the song variety could not match those of IM@S or LL. There were maybe 4 or 5 songs tops in the series roster, and for an idol anime, that is not a very impressive number. But what songs are there were very well put together.The voice acting was great as well, and despite the fact that none of the girls (to my knowledge) was a big name veteran, great performances were delivered.Character: 8/10Like I said in the ""Art"" section, the characters\' physical appearances are not particularly appealing. Regardless, the character development of each of the girls is another great point for WUG. Unlike IM@S, which seemed to either breeze through each of the girls in an episode or less, or LL, which focused mostly on the 3 main girls, WUG tries its hardest to give each of the girls a proper backstory, a unique personality, and relatable struggles. In the end, not all of the girls are equally developed (some get a lot more screentime than others), but characterization was pretty well done compared to IM@S and LL. It really helps that there are only 7 girls in the group, as opposed to IM@S\'s dozen or so.Enjoyment: 7/10The series has its ups and downs in terms of enjoyment. Seeing some of the girls\' dreams broken and their dignities abused made me cringe at times. But all that just made their triumphs all the more satisfying. Overall, I personally greatly enjoyed the series, but I can see how some people won\'t enjoy this series as much as other idol anime. It\'s not as sunny and optimistic as the other idol series, that\'s for sure, but that is what will contribute to WUG\'s appeal for some people.Overall: 7/10If you have been wanting to get into idol anime, but found IM@S and LL too flowery, colorful, and optimistic, then WUG is perfect for you. Its realism and its ability to make you feel for the characters make this a very good entry into the idol genre.If, on the other hand, you watch idol anime purely for the dancing, the animation, and the music, then this series may not meet your expectations. Its animation and character design are sub-par in comparison to those of its competitors (IM@S and LL), and the music is not the catchiest, either.But ultimately, I believe that of all the idol anime released so far, WUG has the most soul and the best realism, and for that alone, it is worth checking out.___________________If you liked this anime, I recommend The IDOLM@STER, Love Live!, and AKB0048. story follows a newly-formed idol group called Wake Up, Girls! and its struggles to gain recognition first in its native Sendai region, and then in all of Japan.

We choose our anime from a random list so we can watch new things. Honestly I didn't enjoy the subject matter much. That said, the anime itself was OK. They made the characters very individual and made it easy to get invested in their struggle. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like the real life Wake Up Girls! but it was an ok slice of life.Laohoam: This isn't the first idol anime i have watched, it also isn't the best.  that being said it wasn't unbearable.  The story progressed well.  Reflecting the issue...of each girl and the bond that helps them overcome each solution.  Though the level of drama was a bit extreme, which is what killed it for me.  if you have nothing else to watch give it a try.Rasanaph- Honestly this just isn't my type of anime, i fell asleep each time we got together to watch it.Dr.R.Dash: SO In short I wish it was better but, I really did enjoy all the seven girls and the back story about who they are , how they all came to be in wake up girls I really enjoyed the music, and dance routines it reminded me of the pure days of EVIL when I was a cheerleader because my coach was Terrifying! and she made us suffer if we messed up a dance , i got a little chill of nauseating nostalgia, another reason This is not my favorite is personally I Hate girl drama- Tis BS thats why I only wasted some life being a cheerleader. of each girl and the bond that helps them overcome each solution.

Youkai Watch Movie 1: Tanjou no Himitsu da Nyan!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24591/Youkai_Watch_Movie_1__Tanjou_no_Himitsu_da_Nyan,"['Yokai Watch is, in a nutshell, a Pokemon imitator that actually tries a few new things, which is why it stands out from the crowd of Pokemon imitators and has become such a success in Japan. Of course, much like Pokemon, they had to have their opportunity to show off their success on the big screen!That success has partially translated over to the international side, however not to the same extent as Japan. That\'s probably why this movie was only in theaters for a single day in America, and wound up quickly popping up on television and Netflix.It\'s clear from the beginning of this movie...that it doesn\'t take itself too seriously and recognizes that a lot of its audience will consist of ADHD children. The first two minutes are devoted to a sketch of familiar characters (to anyone who\'s watched Yokai Watch, at least) trying to tell you to enjoy the movie but winding up in some silly slapstick situation.The story itself isn\'t a fresh idea, but it\'s one that\'s easy to tell/put a new spin on and easily captivate a child audience, involving time travel and a child going back in time and meeting their grandfather as a kid. The presentation is pretty entertaining, thanks in part to Nate\'s sidekicks Whisper and Jibanyan, who are very much the comic relief of the story.As usual, Yokai Watch has a cruder sense of humor than Pokemon, so expect some fart jokes and a joke about pulling a cork out of a yokai\'s butt. Though it seems like they avoided some of the more devious innuendo from the TV series this time, perhaps recognizing that more parents would be in the audience than usual.Towards the end of the film, there\'s an extended sequence in which pretty much every yokai from the series pops up. There\'s a purpose to this in the story, but there\'s also another purpose the producers were certainly thinking of: showing off cool yokai for kids to get excited and point out to their parents. That\'s when it hit me: for some kids, this is going to be their ""Pokemon: The First Movie"". They\'re going to have it on loop on Netflix and be obsessed with it, while their parents are just kind of lost/long for the days of PBS, but don\'t say anything because they recognize the movie as largely harmless.If you\'re a fan of Yokai Watch, you won\'t be disappointed by this movie. It\'s nothing outstanding, but it\'s a good time with familiar characters. If you aren\'t a fan of Yokai Watch, this won\'t convert you. If you know a kid who\'s a fan of Yokai Watch, showing them this movie (if they somehow haven\'t seen it already) will likely delight them and make you happy that they\'re happy. that it doesn\'t take itself too seriously and recognizes that a lot of its audience will consist of ADHD children.

To LOVE-Ru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3455/To_LOVE-Ru,"['Story: Pretty much all filler. Each episode stands alone except the ending and they don\'t really play off of each other. The series strays way too far from the Manga and doesn\'t explore the main parts where you see many characters develop themselves. I understand that the Manga has stories that end in one chapter and expansion is necessary to make the Anime but they could\'ve handled it better. A similar style to the beginning of Full Metal Panic Fumoffu would\'ve been cool where there were two stories split between an episode. Since chapters for To-Love-Ru are short, that would\'ve been a great direction for...this show to take. However, this show\'s filler made me feel incredibly bored as most of the stories weren\'t even adapted from the Manga. They were original stories. Only some of the episodes were based off the Manga. The ending was disappointing but you can predict that it\'ll go nowhere anyway. A predictable ""plot"" and being composed of mostly ecchi scenes gets it a 5. I\'ll admit that a few of the episodes, maybe five of them, I really liked, thought they were well done, and made me laugh a bit.Art: Better than I expected for a series like this. It was pretty consistent for each episode. Nothing looked too horrible to me.Sound: Nothing in the bgm caught my attention and the opening was just okay. As for the voice acting, I didn\'t really have a problem with anyone. No one was extremely annoying to listen to. They did a pretty good job here.Character: I did enjoy watching some of the characters but a lot of them seemed neglected and didn\'t get much screen time, which kind of disappointed me. I know they\'re side characters but if they\'re going to show up more than a few times, make them do more than ""Oops, you can see my panties"" or accidentally get naked. I suppose in the end, I shouldn\'t expect more than that in a series like this.Enjoyment: I finished it. That\'s a sign that I didn\'t completely hate it. Most of the episodes made me want to punch my screen though. They were that awful and stupid. So be careful with it. It\'s supposed to be comedy as well but it didn\'t spark too much laughter from me. I wouldn\'t say that they\'re trying too hard or anything like that. It\'s just that most of the pervy jokes, accidents and misunderstandings are things we\'ve seen before.Overall: I wouldn\'t mind a second series since they have more material to pull from and I enjoyed the Manga. It would be great to see certain stories animated. I just did not like how this turned out because despite the Manga being mostly stand alone stories, the creators of this show felt the need to make their own plots for many episodes... Would I recommend this to anyone? Not really since I can basically describe this as generic. It\'s nothing outstanding and there\'s a lot of ""typicalness"" to it. If anything, for those new to Anime it might just be their first ecchi comedy because if you start watching Anime, you\'ll run into these somewhere along the line unless you\'re very selective and careful.Thank you for reading my review.

Although the shows are both somewhat similar.. I expected a bit more out of the series.Let me start with this.. there are to me.. two seasons to this series basically..and the second series starts somewhere around episode 14.. but.. too be quite honest in my opinion.. Episodes 18-24 are basically OVAs that are stuffed in.. I mean.. There is the story of Kyoto the Fire Girl..a entire episode about a show Lala and Rito watch on television.. which had absolutely nothing to do with...anything.. There is an episode (23) that is adapted to Japanese folk tales which is really neat and informative.. but it has absolutely nothing to do with the storyline..The first episodes though.. 1-10 kept me well entertained.. and I laughed alot.. and the art is done really well.. and of course.. the fanservice is about the only thing that kept me interested enough to watch it.. the girls are very busty.. and very beautiful.. lol.. its hard not to enjoy Lala .. because shes buxom and clueless most of the time.. I liked most of the characters in this.. I didnt find any I didnt really care for much.The OP and the ED are decent.. they sort of fit the general feel of the show.. if you like ecchi.. youll love the OP .. lol.. indeed..So let me warn you with this in closing.. if you dont like fanservice/ecchi ..pass this up.. because its the only thing that keeps this series somewhat afloat.. due to the fact that its so accessive it makes you giggle a bit..Would I suggest this anime? .... Yes... but to someone who just wants to watch something maybe as a change of pace or a break from a anime they just watched with a really deep storyline.. or if you just want to see alot of half naked girls with a couple laughs lol.Thank you for reading! anything..

After trying to confess his feelings to a girl, Haruna Sairenji, he accidentally confesses to Lala and says to him ""Lets get married"". From there on Rito tries to get out of the relationship with Lala, but has other things in his way that actually makes him closer to her. The plot does get more of a serious tone towards the end of the anime, but overall it\'s just a fun anime.My...favorite character in this show is without a doubt Lala. She is one of my all time favorite female characters. I don\'t know why but I like characters like her. This charismatic, upbeat, joyful personality and always having a positive outlook no matter how bad the situation. Even though Rito accidentally ""proposed"" to her. Lala loves Rito with all her heart and you can see in the show that she is devoted to him. Speaking of Rito he is a clumsy pervert. Literally think of every way to accidentally cop a feel and he does it. He doesn\'t like to think of himself as a pervert he just is really clumsy. And yes that is a running gag in this show. I also like that unlike other harem male leads, Rito doesn\'t want a harem he just gets tangled up into one.The comedy in my opinion is pretty funny. Even though some people can get irritated with running gags, but I just love them.Do I think To Love Ru is great. No. In all honesty the story is pretty stupid, but is it funny and entertaining Yes. I think this show is very good, has likable characters, nice music and voice acting. If you don\'t like ecchi anime then you\'re going to dislike this show.

(Insignificant because, so far, and most likely in the future, that haven\'t and won\'t be developed upon in anyway).But already I recognise this anime to be an annoyance which is all mere filler (no plot development except for the first two episodes), and what makes it worse is the travesty that is Rito\'s character; he is utterly annoying and unbearable in large doses. The most grinding little twat in the history of Japanese animation.His character, along with his voice actor, make him a idiot weakling who overreacts or gets majorly embarrassed at every single little detail good or bad, resulting in an utterly pathetic and downright annoying character who makes the show nearly unbearable to watch. He’s far too loud and far too annoying. And my overuse of the word ""annoying"" is even annoying me, but I can\'t say anything else.There has been absolutely no character development from any character in this series, (only new characters get introduced here and there), especially from Rito (although by ep. 14 he has stated he will change (I won\'t say how) but I predict the show will continue to plod along. Never changing).The only thing that keeps me here is the fan service, and that never keeps me around for long without an interesting plot (which there isn\'t, since it\'s all unrelated filler) and a bearable main character around (which there isn\'t, for the reasons above.For characters, I give this 3 instead of 1, since the characters of Lala and Haruna are pretty much spot on and well suited to their other aspects (appearance, relationships with other characters etc etc) and are mildly interesting. Zastin speaks for himself.Overall I\'d like to give this anime 5, the extra 3 in recognition of Lala, Haruna, and Zastin, but the cons of this ""anime"" outweigh the pros brought by these 3 characters, so I give To-LOVE-Ru a 2: Dreadful.I hope the manga isn’t like this.

The series had so much potential, but in the end, turned out to be one big failure... It had no plot whatsoever, beside the first few episodes, which introduced the ""story"". No plot progression for characters as well, what they did was throw in a few new characters during the show and there it ended. They could use much more interesting turn of events and character progression it even hurts to think about it.Another thing I have to point out - the humor in this series is simply NOT FUNNY... AT ALL. The only one who actually made...me laugh was Zastin - he\'s a genious, not to mention his seiyuu is Takehito Koyasu and he\'s one of my favorites (Adam Blade from Needless, Shark Fujishiro from Seto no Hanayome, Luke Valentine from Hellsing...). Still wasn\'t worth it...Sound and animation are OK I guess, nothing special but not great either. Too much tenticle service also brought it down for me, though other echii scenes were decent. There were a few, only a FEW normal episodes, yet they also weren\'t satisfying, the rest were simply dreadful. When I got to the 9~10\'s episode, I thought I\'m gonna quit, but still gave it another chance - that was a mistake.As I said, I did not enjoy the series at all and would not recommed it to anyone.

If you've watched Harem/ecchi/romance-comedy anime before you wont really find anything groundbreaking about this anime.  So if you don't like these kinds of shows, I suggest you stay away. It is basically your multi-sided struggle over the main male character. I personally have no problems with the alien/marriage theme, but I find the plot of this series all to predictable.Art: For a new show the animation quality is what you would call decent. Its not high quality, but it isn't crap either (although the first episode did seem...to be on the low quality side). In spite of a few sequences (of course the perverted scenes are always drawn a little better to capture the interest of the viewer), I was surprised that the quality was not as good as I expected to be. So if you like top notch designed and colored anime, don't expect it to be the next high def series off the market.Sound: The soundtrack for this series is not bad. The OP and ED singles are great. I personally prefer the OP over the ED, but its really a matter of taste in music. The BGM has yet to play a role in the series so far, so it really is not much you can say about it as of yet.Character: I find the cast in general pretty generic, with a few exceptions. The male protagonist strikes me as the one of the most generic, if not THE MOST, characters in the entire series. It literally seems as if he was taken from another romance-comedy series and molded with a different character design. The same could be said for other characters as well who more or less resemble characters from other anime (though have yet to be developed or revealed).Enjoyment:  If really can't decide whether or not you want to watch this, I dont blame you, I find the show a bit iffy, even though I do like harem shows a lot.

Now this is only going to work for those who are really into ecchi/comedy or something light-hearted in general as \'To love-ru\' lacks any semblance of a plot and is entirely episodic. One common occurrence that I\'ve noticed during my time on MAL is that people will usually go into these type of series knowing full well what they are and then complain about it afterwards anyway. This anime is targeting a...very specific audience and if you do not fall within the boundaries of that audience then you will naturally end up bored or even despise the series. You can guess which side of the camp I\'m on.The ""plot"" of this anime is a no brainer. There\'s a fragile looking teenage boy (Yuuki Rito) who has tremendous difficulties dealing with the opposite sex. One day a female alien (Lala) teleports to his bathroom & he ""accidentally"" gropes some boobs and all hell breaks loose. After that incident, as if through some divine prank, our hero finds himself randomly bumping into women\'s private parts like a blind man at an orgy. Things only keep getting more hectic from then on as the protagonists unintentional shenanigans intensify exponentially until the whole thing goes positively FUBAR.That\'s it. That\'s your whole plot described right there. What happens between that initial introduction and the ending is more or less plot insignificant and for the most part features side-stories and fillers alike - all aimed at giving you as much ecchi as possible and increasing your chances of having a stroke. And \'Love-ru\' doesn\'t mess around either. In some episodes they\'ll give you buck-naked characters for your viewing pleasure within a few seconds after the opening song.But that\'s not the only noticeably interesting quality of this anime, in my opinion. The comedy here might not be anything novel in the ecchi genre but it is very easy to understand and follow. You won\'t need a degree in Japanese history or the inside knowledge of the anime industry to get the jokes here. Most of the comedy is slapstick and centered around surrealistic situations. Girls popping out of nowhere to hug a peeing man who then proceeds to pee all over himself, the toilet and the hall of his school while running frantically... is pretty surrealistic to me unless times have moved on and that\'s what teenagers in highschools now do to kill time.The art is precise and for an ecchi anime it has to be anyway, since the visual aspect is half of the success here. This series\' primary focus on female characters can be easily seen and especially the clothing they have on. However all other things have also been drawn with attention to detail. The overall quality is very good.The sound/voice acting is likewise good but surprisingly the ""OST"" of this anime is recycled. I\'ve heard some of the songs used here in other animes, one notable example being \'Sister Princess\'. It makes the series seem more generic, then again the OST is not what you\'ll want to be focusing on here. Of course the opening and ending is still unique and befitting of an ecchi series.Now we come to the most dreaded part of the review. Enjoyment. The most difficult time for a reviewer comes right after he/she finishes a particular anime. Not before or during but after the anime ends. You have to sum your feelings up and express them but also make a recommendation to potential readers. So I\'ll say this - if you\'re unsure or don\'t like ecchi mixed in with comedy don\'t watch this. You\'ll hate it, leave a rating of 2 and curse the producers. When Xebec, TBS and Sentai Filmworks sat down together on this project, it was decided from the outset that it was going to target a rather narrow audience and that audience will be able to appreciate the fact that this anime is very good at what it does - ecchi entertainment. For everyone else however, it will be a waste of time.I for one enjoyed it as \'To Love-ru\' served its intended purpose. The story is lacking considerably, at times it\'s camp as hell but none of that matters because that\'s not what this anime is about.8 points from me. very specific audience and if you do not fall within the boundaries of that audience then you will naturally end up bored or even despise the series. You can guess which side of the camp I\'m on.The ""plot"" of this anime is a no brainer. There\'s a fragile looking teenage boy (Yuuki Rito) who has tremendous difficulties dealing with the opposite sex. One day a female alien (Lala) teleports to his bathroom & he ""accidentally"" gropes some boobs and all hell breaks loose. After that incident, as if through some divine prank, our hero finds himself randomly bumping into women\'s private parts like a blind man at an orgy. Things only keep getting more hectic from then on as the protagonists unintentional shenanigans intensify exponentially until the whole thing goes positively FUBAR.That\'s it. That\'s your whole plot described right there. What happens between that initial introduction and the ending is more or less plot insignificant and for the most part features side-stories and fillers alike - all aimed at giving you as much ecchi as possible and increasing your chances of having a stroke. And \'Love-ru\' doesn\'t mess around either. In some episodes they\'ll give you buck-naked characters for your viewing pleasure within a few seconds after the opening song.But that\'s not the only noticeably interesting quality of this anime, in my opinion. The comedy here might not be anything novel in the ecchi genre but it is very easy to understand and follow. You won\'t need a degree in Japanese history or the inside knowledge of the anime industry to get the jokes here. Most of the comedy is slapstick and centered around surrealistic situations.

He spends easily a majority of the anime obsessing over a girl, because of flowers, and he makes the typical clueless male trope seem like a genius. The show itself has little plot, and seems filled with nothing but filler, using the main love interest, Lala, as fanservice, and the inner thoughts of a truly idiotic male protagonist. The show had plenty of potential for a good story, and character growth, but it's squandered to over the top fan service, and the idea that the protagonist is in love...with the girl he's obsessed with, Haruna. Haruna herself is more of a side character, but feels forced in an attempt to make her a main character. The art work is very good. The sound is good. The characters are mostly uninteresting with the exception of Lala, and a couple others. If you're coming for an interesting romance, and a good, thought out story, stay away. Hell, run like Jason Vorhees was chasing you in an 80s slasher flick. If you came for fan service, and over the top goofiness, then this is your show. with the girl he's obsessed with, Haruna.

Now its an adaptation of the manga, and as far as I can tell, it only adheres to the source material in spirit.  Not that there is a problem with that.  It'd be rather unfair to compare it manga anyway.First up is the plot, or the lack thereof.  They work quite well as standalone episodes, since there is not much continuity among them.  However, there are some plot holes here and there.  I still can't find the point in the anime that explains how Run ends up liking Rito.  They even...tacked on a mini-arc at the end which brought the show to somewhat of a conclusion.  It may have been hasty but there was little else they probably could have done.As for the art, in tune with the spirit of the manga is very, ahem refreshing with judiciously placed art and lighting.  Though there is a tinge of reuse and the feeling of loss when some scenes could not be depicted due to the violence (which has many reasons as to why it is so).  The art shifts in certain episodes are a well done as well.  Overall, quite good.The sound however, is not something to write home about.  It is adequate for the scenes depicted, but there is nothing special of note in it.  Same goes for the background music.  The OP and EDs are well done though and I am sucker for the guitar entrance of the OP.Unfortunately, romantic comedies thrive on status quo, which requires that the relationships between characters stay the same.  Quite so as is the case with To-LOVE-Ru's main characters.  The love triangle that started has never progressed, and apart from the rare episode where we get to see Lala in another light (even then, they pressed the reset button at the end).  However, surprisingly enough, its the secondary characters that get explored a bit more.  Though some get very few episodes, or none at all, its quite easy to see that they are people themselves.  This is a far cry from the same old indecisive Rito, shy Haruna and energetic Lala.Quibbles aside, it is an enjoyable show.  It really is more comfort food, nothing ground breaking but its not a total failure in following the formula though.  There is not much else going for it except for the art, so I recommend this only for those who just want some eye candy.

The protagonist always gets into ""misunderstandable positions"" with the girls whom all seem to feel something to the protagonist. All the space business doesn\'t help either. If you ever expect something more than this, to-LOVE-Ru is not for you.7/10Art: The art is what I\'d call typical for your average ecchi anime. It\'s not bad, but it\'s not ultra high quality of course. I found no reason to make it high quality when all the fans of harem would watch it unless it has seems like it\'s from 1990s. Don\'t ask me how those ripped...off clothes are replaced.7/10Sound: saikou no chansu Now is the time! minogasanai- Oops sorry about that. I must say that the OP and ED of to-LOVE-Ru is pretty catchy. Especially after you watch them over and over again ""for various reasons."" Though I like the OP more, the ED isn\'t unbearable or anything. For background music, I can\'t really decide. It surely isn\'t the type I\'d download buy, but it doesn\'t have any moments that I feel the loss of background music. The seiyuu cast is good too. It\'s my first time listening to Tomatsu Haruka, but her voice as Lala is really cute ^^ And Rito is of course voiced by a girl.9/10Characters: I must say that none of the characters can be classified as unique (well, maybe Lala\'s dad, but you get the point.) BUT, even though they are not unique, they are not rip-offs (not counting our usual extremely lucky ""but-i-love-both-of-them"" Rito of course.) The girls are all lovely as expected. Aside from the main interests, there are many funny (and somehow unique) side characters in the show, all being aliens. Ranging from cute little to absolutely perverted monsters, they will manage to make you laugh quite a few times.7/10Enjoyment: Comedic aspect of to-LOVE-Ru can always be noticed. There weren\'t any comedic moments that seemes ""dull"" to me, but that of course depends on how much you like ecchi. I take that back, you may find it funny even if you don\'t like it that much.This anime is much more than being extremely ecchi version of a certain anime made with absolutely nothing in mind.9/10Overall: If you like ecchi/harem/comedy genres and laugh out loud when the protagonist goes on a series of misunderstandings just to get hit by the girl he loves, this is the anime for you.

This anime is full of fan service, I mean packed full, there isn't an episode without a decent amount of ecchi scenes. Despite the fan service and dull story it is still a pretty funny and fun to watch anime, with the following continuation to Motto To LOVE-Ru and To LOVE-Ru Darkness being very enjoyable to watch.What I loved about the To LOVE-Ru series as a whole (all 3 seasons), was the enjoyment. This anime made me laugh but was fun and...uplifting throughout, it was just very pleasant to watch. I'm not one to watch anime one handed but the fan service usually came with a laugh so it added to the anime without being purely for fan service sake. The romance in the anime is enjoyable to watch unfold albeit a bit frustrating sometimes but overall it was sweet and really makes you envy the main character.What I disliked about the To LOVE-Ru series was the repetitiveness. They re-used so much over and over. Almost all the jokes came from the same misunderstandings, basically all the comedy came from misunderstandings. Almost every episode followed the same format, a flower or invention would do the same thing and the outcome would be the same and it got a bit tiresome. This series is incredibly predictable, you can easily guess what is about to happen and it ruins a lot of moments. I disliked how the main characters and side characters roles kept changing so much throughout the series, some characters would disappear and reappear whenever it suited the writers to throw them in, it really devalued any character progression when their roles were messed around so much. I disliked how the first season had 26 mediocre episodes and the much better follow up seasons only had 12 episodes each.(Story: 7/10)The story of To LOVE-Ru the first season takes place over 26 episodes. I've watched some great anime that told an entire story over 26 episodes, and yet this anime did nothing over 26 episodes. There is basically no story to the first series, it's really just showing the day to day life and events of the characters. Well there is a story but its overshadowed by the fan service and random events that it becomes almost unimportant. After 10 episodes I was about to drop this anime but I'm glad I didn't. To LOVE-Ru is the first season, followed by Motto and then Darkness. The first season is nothing special at all but the following seasons make up for it, they are much much better in every way and are thoroughly enjoyable. The story and enjoyment factor goes up with every season, the first season (To LOVE-Ru) for me would be a 7/10 at a push, the next season (Motto To LOVE-Ru) a much better 8/10 and the final season (To LOVE-Ru Darkness) a strong 9/10 in my opinion.I rarely mention the art of anime series because I like contrast between different series with their own unique style of drawing and colouring. I will however say that the art of To LOVE-Ru was nothing impressive at all but I was really impressed with the next two seasons, a lot of work was put into the vivid colours of Motto and Darkness with a nice soft feeling on the eyes.Overall I enjoyed this anime as a whole and I will be watching any new episodes they bring out but it has a lot of flaws and is far from perfect which is expected from a harem anime I suppose. My tip would be to not watch this anime around your family, it would raise too many questions I feel if anyone saw what you were watching. Since the anime is so immersed in fan service you should get the uncensored DVD versions which have better quality and are uncensored so you don't have to stare at mist and sunshine and can actually watch the series as it was meant to be watched. uplifting throughout, it was just very pleasant to watch.

What can I say, there was some potential in the story though it was not the most original. And since To Love-ru was made relatively recently, the animation quality was very well done.Now that I've got all the positive factors out of the way, its time for some good ol' criticism. The music was not great or memorable and the characters were cliched, but there was one thing that topped them all. To Love-ru flirts with the borders between ecchi humor and hentai. There is often tentacle monster fondling, but in those situations, there is usually a clothes barrier between the tentacles and the...skin (though the tentacles do reach in between the legs a few times).So say your watching this anime at home and one of these scenes occurs as your mom is about to walk by. Do you keep watching because it's not actually hentai, or do you try to block the screen so she can't see and look even more suspicious to her?Now i am not saying that ecchi humor is bad or that hentai sucks, but I would prefer knowing what catagory an anime falls under. To Love-ru just felt weird as I was watching it. It failed to create a viewer friendly atmosphere for me, but who knows you might enjoy it. It's just not my cup of tea. skin (though the tentacles do reach in between the legs a few times).So say your watching this anime at home and one of these scenes occurs as your mom is about to walk by.

So for those of you wondering is this something new no absolutely not but is this...something enjoyable...short answer yes long answer maybe leaning towards a yes.Story- Yeah the story is not that complex it's a love comedy ecchi so it has pretty much everything you expect (mandatory hot spring episode you for some reason cannot have an ecchi series without one). Basically it adds a few new swings to the whole scene but basically most episodes are scenes and scenarios that if you've watched pretty much any other series that focuses around the same general plot you've seen it before. My opinion not so bad I was glad to see something new at all seeing as most series today lack even the creativity to try and come up with a new idea or twist to make their series interesting. Although I'm telling you now I subtracted one point from story because there was one episode in the series that just had nothing at all to do with the story line in any way form of fashion and it only pissed me off for the next week that I had watched it so yeah (its episode 20 for those of you who wish to know).Art- Okay yes the art was really good. I mean it's not my eyes are bleeding from beauty good but it make you stop and admire it for a while good but this is actually becoming very common today especially in series where the basis is a form of love comedy.Sound- No joke the sounds were pretty good everything matched up all the sounds were smooth and best of all the voice acting was incredible.Character- Well yeah it's not as though we haven't seen these kinds of characters types before and you'll know what I mean the instant you watch this series but what kept me from completely flunking this series on characters were the unique and innovative styles innovating to make them unique I mean typically we can just point and go generic character #2 but in this case even though it is generic character #2 it is an interesting version of them with some new twists put onto their character type (alright not completely true but you will notice that some characters do not always act as you expect them too).Enjoyment- So how do I feel after finishing this series...pretty good actually. It had an acceptable story line a decent moving pace and in my opinion a pretty good ending.So do I recommend this series as a matter of fact I do if you like comedy or ecchi this is definitely the series for you although I'm warning you in advance if you expecting a lot of drama, romance, and especially action you will be sorely disappointed. And once again a word of warning don't waste your time watching episode 20. something enjoyable...short answer yes long answer maybe leaning towards a yes.Story- Yeah the story is not that complex it's a love comedy ecchi so it has pretty much everything you expect (mandatory hot spring episode you for some reason cannot have an ecchi series without one).

To Love-ru has alot of comedy, ecchi, it has only a little romance and sci-fi, but not really much.Where is the story about?It goes about a boy(Yuuki, Rito) who is in love with a girl(Sairenji, Haruna), and then Rito meets another gir(Lala Satalin) from another planet(Deviluke). She ran away from home because her father wants her to get married. She wanted to marry Rito and then fell in love with him. Most of the time there happends something because of Lala's brilliant self-made inventions - Which don't always work the...way they should be working - so the invention causes some problems..Storyline 7/10It doesn't have an outstanding storyline.. Almost every episode stands apart from the other episodes. Some people probably don't like To Love-Ru because it's plot..Art 9/10The art is very good. It's drawn quite modern, I like the way things are drawn and I like the clothes, hair and eyes. Though I do know anime with more detailed artwork, compared to those this is more simple.Sound 8/10It is good, but I think some people might think Lala's voice is a bit overrated, but I think it fits her personality perfectly. I also like the music, it is not outstanding, but it's nice.Characters 8/10The characters all have their own personality,there are alot characters with totally different personalities.

Never has an anime given me such grief. This was an extremely hard show for me to get through. 26 episodes! Of what? That\'s a bloody good question! I have no idea just what this anime is trying to tell me. I have never seen such a cringe worthy compilation of terrible humour, immensely drab and repeated cliche \'harem scenes\', sub- par ecchi scenes that don\'t even KNOW whether they want to take advantage of the show\'s R+ rating, as well as a story that serves NO PURPOSE.The entire show was utterly, and completely, pointless. ""Don\'t watch...ecchi shows looking for good story"" some may say. Fair point, perhaps watching a show that has a completely pointless story doesn\'t work for me. What I\'m concerned about primarily here is... what the show DOES focus on and what it DOES value is also done to a horrific standard; i.e the humour and the ecchi scenes. The story and the humour are both closely intertwined, which is why I have mentioned the story.The issue with this story is not only in the fact that it is totally pointless... it is also physically painful to watch. The humour present is just so stupid, and the story events are supposed to be funny and goofy... but they\'re really not at all. They\'re just crap. There is no other way for me to explain it without pulling out my foul-word-repertoire. The only time I was laughing was when it was beginning to hit me just how terrible this show is.The ecchi, also closely linked to the story (which leaves the ecchi dead on arrival, as the scenes are badly executed due to the badly written story) is just lacking. If you\'re going to have a show based so heavily around ecchi- scenes, make them good. Seriously. (I will say that To LOVE-Ru Darkness really picks up the ball on this one, but that\'s not related to this steaming pile of buffalo feces i.e the first season of this show). The ecchi scenes are just not good enough for a show like this. They cover the nipples more than they should, and as has been previously mentioned, the scenes are just badly executed in general, to an eye- rolling extent.Now, the characters. Oh god, the characters. Here we go. The main character, of course, being Rito (who is clearly just an unfortunate soul trapped in a terrible anime for the lowest common denominator) is just a completely pointless character. Yes, there are a few scenes demonstrating the fact that he\'s just a genuinely \'nice\' kid, and that he likes plants (which is the basis for which one of the characters in the show falls for him... what kind of CRAP is that?!), but they hardly explore his character at all apart from his internal conflict regarding whether or not he wants to bone the hyperactive pink haired bimbo or the ONLY INTERESTING CHARACTER IN THE SHOW, Haruna. Instead they just use his character as a means to instigate terrible ecchi scene after terrible ecchi scene; you know, the usual trip over and somehow strip the woman naked - mistakes and bumbles that are mildly funny once or twice, but become ridiculously depressing to watch after 26 EPISODES.I don\'t want to make this too long, but in summary, all of the other characters except for Haruna, in this season anyway, are just \'there\', and serve no purpose other than to be \'hot\' or to be stripped naked. Lala is one of the few anime girls that I would willingly punch in the face, and the school principle should be arrested. Not for being a sexual predator, but for being a fat midget who is NOT FUNNY AT ALL.So, what do we have here? We have a story that is completely and utterly pointless with NO redeeming aspects whatsoever, whether it be in regards to the characters (who have the depth of a piss puddle) or the humour (which is some of the worst I\'ve seen in anime thus far). I am aware that a lot of the things I have outlined in this review aren\'t unusual for a harem anime, but my concern is that this anime does everything BADLY. I actually LIKE a lot of the aspects that this show presents; aliens, ecchi, humour, just to name a few. What concerns me is just how TERRIBLY these were done. If you\'re going to have a crap story, support it with something else that\'s good in place of it. A an anime that is weak in all aspects, to the point where it hurts to watch a few minutes of one episode out of 26 EPISODES, should not be allowed to exist.I regret ever getting into this series. ecchi shows looking for good story"" some may say.

It was too late to correct it, and I feel ashamed for what I did... yeah, you guessed it. I watched Motto to LOVE-Ru before this, which was apparently season 2. In retrospect, I probably should have figured that out when there were a bunch of scenes in Motto to LOVE-Ru talking about the previous events in this season. Ah well, what are you going to do?Anyways, To LOVE-Ru. Most people who enjoy echii have probably heard of...To LOVE-Ru Darkness, one of the most popular echii animes of last year. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Season 1 of the To LOVE-Ru series. As I said before, it might be pretty easy to get all the seasons mixed up at first glance, but I can assure you that this is definitely Season 1. I\'ve always been a fan of the echii genre. I\'m not a pervert, I don\'t watch it for all the fan service, but I\'ve found that there seem to be a lot of echii animes with appealing stories, and usually ends up having some good love interests throughout the show. To LOVE-Ru is one of my personal favorite echiis, along with Heaven\'s Lost Property and Yosuga no Sora. So, without further ado, let\'s get this review started, shall we?Animes these days have started to lack in the story department. Either the stories have all been done before, or they are just plain bad, but what makes them good is how they\'re planned out and presented. To LOVE-Ru was more or less on the ""Done Before"" side of the line. The story goes like this: Boy likes girl, girl might secretly have feelings for that boy, boy cannot confess feelings due to shyness and bad luck, alien spaceship crashes to earth and nearly kills this boy, boy takes bath, girl magically appears in bath, accidental booby squeezing, sudden engagement. Yup. That\'s pretty much it. The male protagonist is engaged to an alien (a very attractive one at that), and the most surprising thing is that she\'s actually okay with it. So throughout the story, it\'s the two characters getting to know eachother better with more characters popping in and more minor and random stories suddenly appearing. It wasn\'t until the final 3 episodes where the climax of the story takes place, and the ending was somewhat disappointing. But hey, that\'s why more seasons were made, right? Even though this seems like a common story among anime these days, I enjoyed it for the most part.To LOVE-Ru was brought to you by Sentai Filmworks in the year 2008. Previous animes include The World God Only Knows, Ef, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and other animes. Personally, they have been one of my favorite people when it comes to art styles. I liked how the characters were portrayed (pantie/boob shots excluded), and it had an overall original feel to it. I liked it quite a bit.To LOVE-Ru is one of the more popular titles in the anime world... there aren\'t many echii fans who haven\'t heard of it before. So a question: why hasn\'t this been licensed in America for dubbing yet? I feel like they could actually do well in the process of getting an English dub for it since most of the characters could have fairly predictable actors in it. But anyways, the cast for To LOVE-Ru involves Haruka Tomatsu as Lala, an actress you might know from titles such as Asura Cryin\', My Pet Monster, and Sword Art Online. We also have Sayuri Yahagi from animes such as Karneval (TV), Asura Cryin\', and Sola. And finally Akeno Watanabe from Aria, Code Geass, and the new anime Free!. We have an interesting choice of actors and actresses, and I can say that they all did a good job. It was above average work, but it wasn\'t perfect exactly. A good job though.And now we have the characters of To LOVE-Ru. First of all, let me say that this is probably one of the best harem animes that I\'ve seen since Negima!? and Love Hina. It had a vast selection of girls, and they were each unique. First off, we have Lala. She\'s the Princess of the planet Deviluke. She comes to earth due to the fact she refuses to get married, but just ends up getting engaged anyways, but she\'s fine with it. She\'s super cheerful throughout the anime, and has no problem being naked. Next we have Haruna. She\'s shy, sweet, and very pretty. She gets embarrassed easily, which our main protagonist has found out by multiple slaps in the face. Next we have Rito, our main protagonist. In most echii animes, the main protagonist happens to be a pervert. Luckily he\'s not, but he\'s the kind of guy who gets embarrassed amazingly easily if he walks into the girls changing room by mistake or sees a girl naked by accident. He is an overall nice guy. There is also Yami, my personal favorite girl in this series. She is an assassin from space sent to kill Rito. Her hobbies include using her hair to beat him into a pulp, walking around town, and eating Taiyaki Pastries. She isn\'t technically a Tsundere, but she is definitely dangerous, but very very cute. And then, the one girl everyone seems to love despite her being 12 years old, Mikan, Rito\'s younger sister. She\'s cute, she can cook, and shows signs of a brother complex throughout the series. Interesting combinations if you ask me. After that, there are a bunch of minor characters which are hard to hate, but at some points they might get annoying. However, not often does this happen, so the characters were nicely done.As I said before, this is one of my favorite echii animes. Yes, there was a lot of fanservice (A LOT), but that wasn\'t the reason I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for multiple reasons, but the main reason was just because of the comedy and romance throughout the course of 26 episodes.The High of To LOVE-Ru: Excellent character planning and designing.The Low of To LOVE-Ru: Fairly bland story, but still able to make it not completely bland.Overall I liked To LOVE-Ru a lot, and I recommend this to anyone who enjoys echii animes, fanservice, or has seen Motto to LOVE-Ru or To LOVE-Ru Darkness.

As ecchi is ok-ish, if...you know what I mean. you know what I mean."", 'Alright. Here we have another RomCom ecchi harem anime. I\'m not a big fan of Harem, or even reverse harem, but if it\'s played out well I might enjoy it. To be quite honest, I watched To LOVE-Ru about a year ago, but I still remember most of it. So let\'s get on with the review, shall we?Story: 5The story is of a boy that we can easily call Anonymous, because this kind of character is a little rehashed. He can\'t confess to a girl, and then another alien girl appears that\'s running away from her planet. To stay on Earth, she says she\'ll marry...Anonymous. Alright. This kind of idea could be good. The problem is, too many characters were introduced and the focus of the story was kind of lost Anonymous never really becomes closer to the girl he likes or Lala, the alien girl.The falling point in the story department is that although the story itself had some sort of potential, that potential was lost when it became too much of an ecchi harem. I know the idea of some extraterrestrial girl falling in love with a pathetic human is hawt, but it\'s not realistic. At most the alien would become interested in the human, and use them for lodging, and perhaps over time they may see something in this person. In a way, Lala does this, but she falls in love with him immediately. If I was Lala, I\'d look at my options. Surely there was a better guy than Anonymous on that planet? I don\'t know, someone with more PERSONALITY?!Art: 9Now, this is where To LOVE-Ru is very good. The art is rather beautiful and clean. The opening art was very well done. I only wish they didn\'t do so much zooming on their tits and crotch for credits. Seriously. I almost didn\'t watch this anime because of that. Each character design is unique in my opinion Lala\'s  space outfit was something that drew me to this anime, as it looked like a mix of a devil, alien, and slut outfit. To LOVE-Ru is one of those animes in which the characters actually look their age, and not like little midgets trying to convince everyone they really are 16.Sound: 9To LOVE-Ru\'s opening is ""Forever we can make it,"" which was a song I immediately fell in love with. For me, often the opening is what ultimately convinces me if I should watch an anime or not, and To LOVE-Ru\'s opening art along with song convinced me to watch it. The ending, ""Lucky Tune,"" was also catchy, though not as much. I\'ve often hummed these songs out loud in public because of how great they are.As for voice acting, I\'m going to have to watch a clip or two before I review this, because I\'ve forgotten all about it.-INTERMISSION-Alright I\'m back. The voice acting is very good, actually. The women do their parts of screaming in embarrassment pretty well, and the guys do a good job of voicing perverts and Anonymous. I wouldn\'t say ""realistic"" is the word. Honestly. Girls don\'t really scream out in embarrassment. I\'m a girl. I should know. Maybe some do, but most would cover themselves up and hiss at the guy. And the guy would apologize, close the door, and find a nice quiet room to rub one out.I\'m getting off topic, aren\'t I?Character: 3Now, one could say the majority of the cast being girls is a falling point too. I disagree, unless every single one is a part of the harem. Let\'s consider a non-anime famous story: Harry Potter. Weren\'t most of the cast male? Does that mean Hermoine was banging a new guy every week? No! The majority of the cast can be female, but not if that\'s their only selling point. And the male characters aren\'t any better. The principal\'s only point is to be a pervert, Lala\'s bodyguard, whats-his-face is even less of a bodyguard than Anonymous. It seems like he\'s just there to spout shit and be a source of fanfiction.But the other problem with a lot of characters being introduced quickly is that there\'s no development. I never finished To LOVE-Ru, because I don\'t think I could withstand more. Not even Anonymous got any development throughout 20 episodes, and I doubt there would have been any in the next 6. That\'s why I\'m calling him Anonymous.The characters are too 2-dimensional and it makes it hard for me to sympathize with them. If Lala was hit by a truck in the middle of the series, I wouldn\'t shed a tear.You know a series in which the characters develop a lot, and in less than 26 episodes? There\'s Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Elfen Leid, which is more ecchi than this. Tokyo Mew mew was even longer, and obviously took their time to develop the characters, although the guy was also an anonymous.Ah, I love a good rant.Enjoyment: 8Now, with all the shit I said about To LOVE-Ru, why do I give it a rather high rating? Because I fully remember watching this and liking it. I just lose interest quickly, and that\'s why I stopped it. I watched episodes 1-18, and a year later I watched 19-20. Then I wondered why I enjoyed this so much. Perhaps it was fun to see the strange antics Anonymous and his harem get into? perhaps it was fun to see Anonymous have his ass kicked by a girl every episode, the whiny loser? Perhaps I wanted to see some fucking development? The only kiss was an accidental male on male-that-can-change-into-a-girl-with-a-sneeze-and-vice-versa, and I\'m not a fan of Yaoi. Or Yuri, for that matter. And this show has the nerve to call itself romance.It did give me a few laughs. Lala\'s sudden useless inventions did make it interesting. See, this is realistic. Lala bringing in some random shit that turns out to be dangerous. A lot of people do that. What\'s not realistic is this thing being an octopus that tentacle rapes Lala and the love interest girl. It\'s also not realistic that nearly twenty girls have some connection to Anonymous. However, I digress. I fully remember enjoying this show. Hey, even the smelliest shit has something good in it. Perhaps it was the music, or the art.Overall: 6.8=7Through some mighty calculating, I give this show a fair rating. It had a good story, great art, and beautiful music, but they just couldn\'t fit that all together into something amazing. Maybe if To LOVE-Ru wasn\'t a harem, I would have gave it a better rating. Yes, it\'s a harem. At least five girls are in love with Anonymous for some reason. The problem with most harems is that they don\'t really give that much of a reason to LIKE the main character. I\'m planning to watch R-15, since it seems the main character isn\'t some washed-up perverted loser. He\'s an intelligent perverted writer. I\'m not sure. I haven\'t watched it yet.I\'m not saying harem animes are bad. The problem with them is that they give much reasoning behind them. Why would an alien girl suddenly love a human. Why would ANYONE like a guy that\'s so indecisive a king took him by the collar and yelled ""YOU INDECISIVE BASTARD!"" in his face, and he STILL couldn\'t make a decision? Come on. It\'s not that hard to tell an alien princess to fuck off, is it? And please don\'t put so many girls in the harem, unless there\'s a valid reason to love the main character.Come on, Harem genre. It\'s not too late to show your potential. Anonymous. Alright. This kind of idea could be good. The problem is, too many characters were introduced and the focus of the story was kind of lost Anonymous never really becomes closer to the girl he likes or Lala, the alien girl.The falling point in the story department is that although the story itself had some sort of potential, that potential was lost when it became too much of an ecchi harem.

It\'s not too late to show your potential.', 'A lot of people recommended this to me. It took me well over a year to finish but I wanted to give it a review because I think it is overhyped.Animation and Sound: The animation is ok. The only problem I have it is that the characters look creepily young which is a problem in an echhi anime. Because of that, many parts of this anime are very uncomfortable and kind of gross. The voice acting is hard to judge because the dialogue is so repetitive that it doesn’t really get a chance to be memorable. The voice acting does shine in the final...episode but at that point it is already too late. The music is also repetitive. Every episode has the same goofy tune which gets really irritating after about the third time you hear it.Characters: After about the 5th episode they become so predictable that there is no point in them even talking. Instead of building on these characters the cast just expands with even more flat characters.Story. This show is tedious. Every episode is like wading through oatmeal. The story starts out interesting and goes absolutely nowhere for 22 episodes. Its just filler through and through. On top of that every episode follows the exact same formula with minor alterations just so we can tell episodes apart. It becomes the same nothing over and over again. There is a main plot but it takes place over 4 episodes, making 22 episodes a complete waste of time. I admit the main plot is ok and actually has some substance. The problem is it is easily drowned out by the fluff surrounding it. This show tries to be a comedy but manages to become completely unfunny. I didn’t laugh once. The closest I would ever come to laughter was a long depressing sigh. With a drawn out story, bland characters, and a complete lack of humor the show really isn’t worth it. If you judge the show by the 4 real episodes its ok. However, a review is not fair if you pick and choose and 22 terrible episodes ruin the average. If you like harem, ecchi, or comedy there are better shows out there so I would say don’t waste your time with this one. episode but at that point it is already too late.

But there is no voting category for imbecilic anime creation. So I\'m forced to put that on the table, up front and center.Does this mean I intend to rip this show a new hole in its\' posterior? Not necessarily. It just means that this show is intended to be liked by folks that have appreciation for things that equate to unreal expectations.And there are times when that is appropriate behavior. For example, if you notice a multi-mile long...asteroid approaching the planet you live on, and understand the consequences of this approaching doom-stone, you may just wish for a nice breezy day on the beach ....   of another planet. That is clearly a good reason to put your mind in the \'make-a-wish\' zone.To LOVE-Ru, is not mainly concerned with that kind of apocalyptic event, and so the wishful thinking now runs into the kind of thinking of; ""... these folks are doing ...  what, ... why? ...""So let\'s now move into the characters, almost all of which need some discussion (I\'m going to deal only with some of the primaries, the secondary characters will take too much time):Rito Yuuki-I realize this kind of fellow turns a lot of teenage boys cold, but let\'s look at this kid with a little more sincerity. Rito is loyal, decent, polite, not excessively aggressive, and he\'s bashful around girls. He is in fact, exactly like the young fellows who often review this show and rip it a new one because of Rito; because they have all the same characteristics. They have them, but don\'t really want them.In other words, they want the girls to be attracted to boys that are abusive, obscene, non-intuitive, crass, rude, overly aggressive, pushy, loud and generally mean-spirited.I\'m sorry to make this absolutely plain, but in real life, Rito will get the girl every time; in comparison to an abusive bastard every time. It\'s just too bad for you young folks that want things to be otherwise. Deal with real life, and try to extend that knowledge into your appreciation for anime.In other words, To LOVE-Ru got this part of its\' story right. Rito is exactly like every other boy his age, in the real world, and just as shockingly non-adult. So he gets flustered around real girls, especially when a pretty girl is in very close proximity.Haruna Sairenji-Haruna is everything most of the critics of this show don\'t really like. Because she is the female version of Rito. She is: loyal, decent, polite, not excessively aggressive, and she\'s bashful around boys. Wow, there\'s a strange thing. And oh, I forgot; she\'s also cute as a bug in springtime.Strangely enough, girls have also been bashful and self-embarrassed around boys; for a very long time. Again, I realize boys don\'t like this kind of girl. They want to think that the more mature view is of a girl who will drag them behind a tree and do sexual favors on demand. This is because the boy is almost always to bashful to ask for that. Boys of this age group believe they are much more manly if they wait for the girl to suggest it for them,  ...  because the boy is already too much of a coward. As well he should be, at Rito\'s age.But in the end, we are all stuck with real life. Most girls don\'t behave that way. And strangely enough, when one finds a girl of that persuasion, the girl doesn\'t get the boy either. At least not for long.Again, To LOVE-Ru got this part right as well. The good girl, in real life; normally wins her hearts\' desire, and ends up with a nice boyfriend, and even a fine husband. I know, I\'m speaking sacrilege, but the truth is; the purpose of dating, meeting friends of the opposite sex, and socializing with them; is to to get married and start a family that will raise children that are worth having in society.The over-sexed girl gets that abusive fellow already described; and never, ever, produces anything worth having. Both die non-contributive to society, and almost never makes anything worthwhile in their own lives. These are the facts of real life.Lala Satalin Deviluke-Lala is a character designed in lala-land. She is pretty, slender and shapely, and she has a tail, and her bat wings stick out from the sides of her hat. She is in fact a 2-dimensional character with an equally simple personality. And for some very good reasons.Lala is a princess of a planetary empire, her father being an abusive bastard that can destroy pretty much whatever he wants, and uses that fact to his personal advantage. A clear case of absolute power corrupting absolutely.Her father is such a bastard, that the whole last set of episodes of To LOVE-Ru are all about a challenge designed to destroy the suitor to his daughter, Rito. Does he play fair? No, breaks even his own rules in order to win. In other words, Mister Deviluke lies, cheats and steals, even when he can win without doing so. What a piece of pond scum! One wonders why, in his infinite display of disreputable conduct, he doesn\'t just lay it on the line, and create a new family by sexually assaulting his daughter (collaborative pun intended). It is not outside his own personality.Lala however, is a fairly nice little girl (I can\'t figure out why she should be) that is quite intelligent, in an intellectual set of disciplines that leads to the creation of inventions that are never developed sufficiently to work the way they were designed.In other words, she\'s a dilettante, who never, ever; finishes anything she ever starts. Which leads us all to a really important question. And that is;""When she\'s finally gotten to the point where she would normally drop an invention, as it regards Rito; will she operate as she has in the past, or will she stick to something important, for once?""After all, she got involved with Rito because she didn\'t want daddy to pick her husband. She said as much in the show.Does this make her a bad person? No, far from it. It means she chafes on the abusive and domineering behavior of her father. She would like to strike out into real life on her own, and make choices for her future, by herself. She is, however, a product of her own life. She is a very rich, spoiled brat, who expects everything to work out nicely; and when it doesn\'t, either she builds her way out of it, or appoints someone responsible. Leaving the whole mess in something or someone else\'s lap. Like Zastin, as a true to life character in which this sort of thing actually happens, in To LOVE-Ru.The only reason Lala gets away with stuff on Earth, is because she is dealing with a whole school full of boys who are too bashful to say NO, and also full of girls who raise their own game because of Lala being a threat to the social structure that they had expected, and is now in jeopardy. Most of the student body are NOT the offspring of the idle rich, and Lala IS. It creates an artificially difficult struggle for everybody concerned.If she were to understand honorable conduct, and all that implies; Lala would go home to Deviluke, and fight it out with her father, take the throne away from him and rule the place as the reasonable and at least polite individual she is capable of.Instead, she runs away from home, hopes her father is too busy blowing up planets to bother about her absence (which of course, makes Lala an accessory to mass-genocide), gets involved with a boy that is almost reaching the point where he can confess his appreciation for a girl in his class; as happens in real life. Totally screws that up, invades another persons\' household, creates extra duties and work for Rito\'s sister, blows up several relationships in school, that at the bottom of all is none of her business, involves her \'true love\' in events containing aliens of no-ones\' choosing, endangers Earth with the arrival of some of these ne\'er-do-wells, and even endangers the alien doctor, that Mister Deviluke should marry. She\'s his kind of girl.In all of these events and scenarios, Lala Satalin Deviluke walks through her life with charm and great cheer, while leaving destruction in her wake. Everybody else has to clean up the messes Lala creates. But Lala is fine, although totally oblivious to almost everything else around her. The only good word that describes Lala is IRRESPONSIBLE, beyond any kind of redemption.The Audio/Music-While the music is cute, it is also mindless J-POP of the worst type. Having no meaning, in the sense that it might have meaning to the anime. I\'m one of those people that think the music should say something about the anime. It doesn\'t. The inter-stigial music is adequate, but continues on the theme of ""What theme might that be?""The dialog is read well, and the mindless commentaries by Lala are appropriate for the situations. This goes for most of the other characters.The Artwork-Actually not bad at all. It describes the actions well, and helps tell the story. Do we get some really fresh background parallax art? No, but it is otherwise adequate.The Story-The basic story plot is excellent, and it had a lot in the way of comedy potential. Potential is what it had. Only a fraction of the comedy potential was ever realized. Would have been much better if Lala\'s father was not quite as much pond scum. Lala should have had a little more intellect (oh I dunno, maybe like real human girls?). But I keep forgetting, this show is to please teenage boys with very little appreciation for \'the thinking stuff\', while providing a female heroin that girls can feel \'speaks to them\'.Yea, right. Really? Is that all Mankind has to look forward to? If so, Mister Deviluke will have little trouble destroying Earth. We\'ll be too busy looking up his daughters\' cute little ass, to notice our cities being blown up for his personal amusement.I\'m done with this review. I\'m done with To LOVE-Ru. I actually sat through all the episodes. God what a trial! The show is entertaining in a certain mindless way, but I\'m sorry if I\'m one of those people that can\'t shut my brain off.I gave this colorful and entertaining piece of mindless pond scum a generous 4. asteroid approaching the planet you live on, and understand the consequences of this approaching doom-stone, you may just wish for a nice breezy day on the beach ....   of another planet. That is clearly a good reason to put your mind in the \'make-a-wish\' zone.To LOVE-Ru, is not mainly concerned with that kind of apocalyptic event, and so the wishful thinking now runs into the kind of thinking of; ""... these folks are doing ...  what, ... why? ...""So let\'s now move into the characters, almost all of which need some discussion (I\'m going to deal only with some of the primaries, the secondary characters will take too much time):Rito Yuuki-I realize this kind of fellow turns a lot of teenage boys cold, but let\'s look at this kid with a little more sincerity.

Totally screws that up, invades another persons\' household, creates extra duties and work for Rito\'s sister, blows up several relationships in school, that at the bottom of all is none of her business, involves her \'true love\' in events containing aliens of no-ones\' choosing, endangers Earth with the arrival of some of these ne\'er-do-wells, and even endangers the alien doctor, that Mister Deviluke should marry. She\'s his kind of girl.In all of these events and scenarios, Lala Satalin Deviluke walks through her life with charm and great cheer, while leaving destruction in her wake. Everybody else has to clean up the messes Lala creates. But Lala is fine, although totally oblivious to almost everything else around her. The only good word that describes Lala is IRRESPONSIBLE, beyond any kind of redemption.The Audio/Music-While the music is cute, it is also mindless J-POP of the worst type. Having no meaning, in the sense that it might have meaning to the anime. I\'m one of those people that think the music should say something about the anime. It doesn\'t. The inter-stigial music is adequate, but continues on the theme of ""What theme might that be?""The dialog is read well, and the mindless commentaries by Lala are appropriate for the situations. This goes for most of the other characters.The Artwork-Actually not bad at all. It describes the actions well, and helps tell the story. Do we get some really fresh background parallax art? No, but it is otherwise adequate.The Story-The basic story plot is excellent, and it had a lot in the way of comedy potential. Potential is what it had. Only a fraction of the comedy potential was ever realized. Would have been much better if Lala\'s father was not quite as much pond scum. Lala should have had a little more intellect (oh I dunno, maybe like real human girls?). But I keep forgetting, this show is to please teenage boys with very little appreciation for \'the thinking stuff\', while providing a female heroin that girls can feel \'speaks to them\'.Yea, right. Really? Is that all Mankind has to look forward to? If so, Mister Deviluke will have little trouble destroying Earth. We\'ll be too busy looking up his daughters\' cute little ass, to notice our cities being blown up for his personal amusement.I\'m done with this review. I\'m done with To LOVE-Ru. I actually sat through all the episodes. God what a trial! The show is entertaining in a certain mindless way, but I\'m sorry if I\'m one of those people that can\'t shut my brain off.I gave this colorful and entertaining piece of mindless pond scum a generous 4.', 'Hmm I do admit that I enjoyed watching this series, but only really for Lala. Everything else was pretty bad.Story:Lol. Pretty nonexistent. Each episode is its own mini-adventure, but the mini-adventures have literally nothing to do with each other. You could watch this entire show in a random order and it would basically be the same. There are only really 3 important episodes where outside characters are introduced (like the episode where Golden Darkness arrives), but other than that all the episodes are completely unrelated. Now, that\'s not to say that just because a show has mini-episodes, it\'s bad. Those who are fans of...Sora no Otoshimono will know that you can still pull off a pretty good story with having mini-episodes. It\'s just with To-Love Ru, each mini-episodes contributes nothing to plot movement nor does it develop any stories or help us answer any conflicts. Each episode just does nothing to help us move forward. It\'s like reading the same page in a book instead of reading through the pages.Art:Not bad, but you can tell it\'s an older animation style. It does look too cartoonish at times, but art usually doesn\'t really affect my opinion on shows unless it\'s just glaringly bad.Sound:I actually really love the opening theme ""Forrever We Can Make It"" and normally I skip openings, but I actually listened to the opening for every episode in this show.Characters:Lala-chan is basically the only highlight of this show. Rito is actually a very likable character as well, but all his potential is not shown. We see the beginnings of a badass/kind male lead which is refreshing in a harem since it seems most harems nowadays just have male leads who need all the female characters to protect him. But his badassery and kindness are barely developed after they\'re shown. What I mean by that is he\'ll rescue one of the girls or do something nice for them, and then that\'s it. He just goes back to his school boy self and doesn\'t try to consider his actions or think about his relationship with the girl he just helped, which is what a normal person would do.But Lala is a really interesting character. She\'s quirky, cheerful, part stupid, part genius. She\'s pretty different from a lot of female characters you see because of this weird combination of personalities. At times she\'ll be serious and profound, and other times she\'ll be dense and have no idea what\'s happening around her, so she\'s extremely entertaining to watch. But once again, there wasn\'t as much character development with her as there could have been. They could have revealed a lot more about her feelings for Rito, but instead decided to make a lot of filler episodes.Enjoyment:Somehow I managed to finish all 26 episodes in about 4 days which is pretty fast for me since I like to take my time watching anime. And for some reason, I didn\'t particularly hate the anime even though I\'m giving it such a low score. I think it was just interesting to watch Lala as a character, but nothing else was really interesting. Yeah, it\'s a comedy, but to be honest I laughed maybe twice during this entire show, and at times I was pretty bored.Overall:If you\'re looking for a relaxed anime, To-Love Ru is definitely it since it doesn\'t have any intense or emotional scenes. But if you\'re looking for comedy (which is what I originally watched it for), then you\'re probably in the wrong place since this anime hardly has any original comedy that you haven\'t already seen in other shows.

Being the very first anime I watched, I really liked it up to the point of rewatching it 4x. I could say TLR is the one that piqued my interest towards anime, all thanks to a friend of mine. However, having watched more anime later on, my opinion of TLR have changed.Story - 6""I LOOOOOVE TLR! I kept laughing throughout the show. Although yeah, there are some fillers in the show that I got bored with. It\'s rather amusing how the MC keeps on failing to clear misunderstandings, ends up in...outworldly situations, yet does not end up being hated by the girls around him. I also liked the last episodes. A real conflict came up, that semi-dramatic finale, and a very heart-warming ending. Score: 9!""And that\'s what I thought back then. Because I liked the series so much, I ended up reading the manga after watching season 2. I have noticed that much of the anime is different from the manga, with the exception of few episodes. That did not change my opinion of TLR.Right now, I definitely don\'t hate TLR S1, but it does not have anything particular to stand out.After watching more anime, I rewatched TLR again December last year because I kinda forgot the story and wanted to watch season 3. What can I say. It ain\'t as good as back then. Ain\'t as funny back then. [There are anime that never fails to keep me laugh (or keep me interested) whenever I watch it.] I realized that this was your typical harem anime. There wasn\'t much substance nor story.Art - 8Considering its a 2008 anime, I think its art is pretty good for its time. The girls are freakin\' kawaii~!Sound - 10I liked all 3 songs, especially the 2nd ED. I had that song looped in my MP3 for some time back then. It really matches up Haruna\'s feelings (who happens to be the spotlight of the ED), be it the lyrics or the sound, and left me a rather strong impact. Nice VA for all, by the way.Character - 8I don\'t particularly like or hate anyone, but for some reason, all the characters in TLR are essential to keep the enjoyment of this series. My most fave: Kotegawa Yui.Enjoyment - 7I had fun when I first watched it. I had fun rewatching it immediately after watching it. Not worth rewatching in a future time, though.Overall - 7 (I probably rated 9 back in 2011)TLR ain\'t a bad series at all. In fact, I owe my love for anime to TLR.There are better anime series in the line of romcoms. TLR focuses on the comedy/ecchi part rather than the romance, which could be a turn off for some. (In the genre of ecchi anime, this one has the upper hand, though.)Does this mean that you should skip TLR and proceed to the better anime romcoms? NO. It\'s worth watching it.

If you do not like borderline porn, harem, random perverts and groping then you might want to find a different series. This show was not that bad. It had potential to be good but it did not quite make it. At first, I only watched a couple episodes then just stopped. Few days later, I ended up finishing it. The story wasn\'t so bad but just poorly executed. It had mostly fillers but the fillers were just different situations that the guy and alien girl went through. Until the last couple episodes, it closes...this series. Then the sequels come out and I tried out those and I just started skipping half of them cause they were fillers also. I basically skipped to the To Loveru: Darkness series and I basically didn\'t miss much except for the fact that the characters never developed after about 4 seasons, give or take, and that it is the same crappy fillers they always had. But I will admit they have a better story, or at least a story this time, and the fillers actually connected with each other. I am not going to spoil the fun for everyone but I will say a couple of things. In To Loveru: Darkness, if you want to see Rito pick a girl in the end chances are he will never pick just one cause of his personality and how he is in the series. You are basically putting your hopes up that are destined to fail you. I would really appriciate if they actually have him pick one girl in the end but I feel like the intentions of the audience and the writer is on something else.All in all, I would probably watch ""To Loveru"" and then just stop so I don\'t ruin myself to the other fanservice sequels. In my opinion, this whole concept was a wasted. I would only watch this if I wasn\'t looking for too much of an ending, for random laughs of enjoyment and also if I wanted to look at attractive anime characters. Other then that, I don\'t really think it is worth watching because the farther you get through the each series of these, the more you get frustrated with certain things that re-occur that will never be re-solved in the end. this series.

This review contains minor spoilers.To LOVE-RuThis… this….. had soooo much goooood. SOO MUCH. Byong Boing! That’s the sound breasts make if you didn’t know! Do you like 2D Girls (Who doesn’t?), do you like the ecchi/lewd nature of anime (.. I DO!)…… do you want to watch something that is both funny and infuriating at the same time? (Probably not) To Love-Ru is all that and more! =)So To LOVE-Ru is about Rito Yuuki, a boy who is, like your typical Harem shows, afraid of all things related to girls. He gets incredibly flustered at the slightest thought...of anything slightly naughty… for instance, imagining his crush in a bikini will cause him to overheat and flip out and just “die”; if you hate hate hate seeing MC’s who act like that, skip To Love-RU, almost every single episode, say for maybe 2 of the 26, involve him getting into situations like that. If you can handle this type of personality, To LOVE-Ru rewards you with many many many many ecchi scenes.The story starts out with Yuuki taking a bath when all of a sudden Lala appears naked in his bath and he just happens to be holding her breasts. Unfortunately for him, the way to propose a marriage to an alien of the Deviluke planet is to…. You guessed it!..... grab the breasts of the woman you want to marry. This is the beginning of To Love-Ru and for the most part, it stays comedic and fun throughout.As I mentioned above, Lala is our alien from Deviluke, she’s super gorgeous, incredibly pretty, has a beautiful and radiant personality, full of bubbly lovey goodness. She has a super cute tail and she has a helper named Peke who can change her outfits on a whim. Some of the best scenes involve Peke changing her outfits, because Peke will wrap himself around her causing Lala to moan in rather sensual matters.Now, a harem can’t consist of just one girl now, can it? So the others are, Haruna, Yuuki’s crush. She has a very shy personality and even though she likes Yuuki, they both tend to act the same when alone, flustered, shy, no words to say. Don’t except “anything” to happen between the two of them. We also have Yami-chan, she’s an assassin who is sent to kill Yuuki, but discovers that Yuuki is actually a really kind guy and she sort of falls for him; I think she’s absolutely amazing and her  ability is super incredible ; she’s also the gothic Lolita of the show; so…… yeah. There is also Run-chan, who is one of the best characters of the anime.  Being an alien, he changes genders in both body and mind 100% whenever he sneezes. As a male, he’s totally in love with Lala and tries to prove how much of a man he is. As a female, she will try her best to get Yuuki to notice her. As a female, she’s one of the best looking girls in the anime and is just so pretty . Then come the cast of supports who just happen to be a part of the harem or somehow involved with Lala or Yuuki, I won’t list them all, but Mikado-sensei is definitely one to look out for, she’s pretty great.So a large cast of characters, a story that makes very little sense and a lot of episodes for something that should probably only be a 1-cour show; how does To LOVE-Ru keep people watching all the way through? Well easy; throughout most of the anime, To LOVE-Ru takes the direction of introducing other aliens who continually try to propose to Lala and fail. There are episodes where Lala tries to please Yuuki as much as possible, there are episodes that include some tentacle action, there are many episodes where the show is simply slice of life goodness. Around half way or so, we’re introduced to Lala’s father and for a second, a real plot starts up, but no… not at all. After that episode the anime goes back into its standard harem fairs and things. The best thing and probably the saving grace for To Love-RU are the ecchi related scenes. Pantsu shots? Yeah, expect to see at least 2-3 pairs of panties being shown per episode. Boobs? Yeah, expect to see the great breasts almost each episode (or honestly, every episode). Skin? Yesss, there is a lot of skin shown in To LOVE-Ru, backside shots, butts, thighs and all sorts of things. Ecchi/lewd is really where To LOVE-Ru shines and it’s the only reason anyone would really want to watch To LOVE-Ru. It’s a harem, with a rather lame MC, great and super cute girls and a lot of fun when Yuuki isn’t involved as much. I know the later seasons really spice things up and thank goodness, I don’t believe To LOVE-Ru could continue on with its direction for much longer before just becoming a chore to watch.Art: It’s 100% static and very plain. The wind moves, but only to reveal pantsu (not complaining) and blow the girls hair. Nothing looks “good” really, aside from the girls themselves. The school is plain, the background art is plain, and everything is really….really plain. Thank goodness the colors are visually rewarding and the girls are pretty and cute. Aside from that, there is detail elsewhere. Shading where it counts, lines drawn in ways to give the viewers a better “understanding” at what they’re looking at, in this regard, huuuge A+ to the art team peoples, you did your job and fulfilled the ecchi role incredibly well, bravo!Music/Sound: An aspect that To LOVE-Ru actually excels at. Great use of BGM, great understanding of when to begin and stop music, great music choices to begin with! The OP is amazing, as is the first ED, but the 2nd ED with Haruna as the key focus, that might be one of the best ED’s ever, it’s seriously so good to listen to and the art with Haruna is just incredible; for instance, there is heavy emphasis on her lips and man, it looks good; it’s simply amazing, really, they make Haruna not just look “good”, but incredibly attractive, more than normal.To LOVE-Ru, an anime filled with ecchi, filled with lewd, filled with super cute girls. That’s really all there is to say about it; I expected something similar to what I received. Lala, however was the highlight of the entire anime and when the story plot started to matter (last two episodes), she did what I never thought she would do, simply because Yuuki is a loser…. I really hope  Haruna and Yuuki get together in Motto, because it’s getting tiring seeing them act so ridiculous around one another . If not, then the lewd needs to be a lot better to really keep interest, much more risqué and more of it too.NOTE: The below are my rather.... mind losing impressions of the OVA\'s, don\'t read, it contains a lot of ""oh my gao/gau\'s"" and me yelling names....OVA: Episode 1: OH MY GAO, that’s incredible! I think To LOVE-Ru would be a ton better if it had Yuuki be like this instead, especially since he’s all “ooooh noooo, girls”, and stuff. I wish his personality was changed though, that would have made this so much better; but Lala is amazing. Saki, this episode made her absolutely amazing and incredible, goooo SAKI!Episode 2: Mikan (Yuuki’s imouto) is way too cute this episode, so unbelievably adorable! Yuuki-baka! Yami-san continues to just be an all-around amazing girl and Haruna actually did something this episode, in an OVA, but still, she did something! Yuuki Baka Baka Baka Baka!!Episode 3: An island resort consisting only of the girls? Yes please. Bikini’s everywhere, rubbing oil on each other, butts, thighs, boobs, and a little more of… oh this is heaven! of anything slightly naughty… for instance, imagining his crush in a bikini will cause him to overheat and flip out and just “die”; if you hate hate hate seeing MC’s who act like that, skip To Love-RU, almost every single episode, say for maybe 2 of the 26, involve him getting into situations like that.

What I will say is this: if you're looking for a lighthearted, ecchi show which is based around just being plain ridiculous for the sake of comedy, then this is the show for you. However regardless of the Romance tag, if you're looking for any kind of deeper romance within...the show then don't bother, you would only be disappointed. If you are also looking for I suppose what you could consider a story and story progression then I would also not recommend this show. Aside from the introductory episodes and the last 3 or so episodes, there really isn't story progression. The show is episodic in that (outside of the parts I mentioned), each episode isn't really going through a story and is individual, because at the start of the next episode it's as if the previous didn't really happen. Therefore the main chunk of the series in the middle between the introduction and ending 3 episodes is like this. Now personally I don't have a massive issue with this as I feel like this was the intention as it is hardly a serious series. But it's my warning if you are looking for some kind of progressive story.Now with that said, onto why i'm personally conflicted. I love the characters in the show. A lot of them are vibrant, individual characters with lots of personality. Lala is a good example of this. However the problem is that barely any of the characters thrown in are fleshed out whatsoever. Because of that, a lot of the characters just lack something for me. Now as this is a silly, over the top show aimed at being a comedy, I hardly expected massive individual episodes for characters with character development; but if there are gonna be characters popping up each episode I want them to at least have some substance or development. This is the main problem with the characters for me. That every single episode, every single character is forced into it for the sake of them doing individual roles that they always do. I think the hot springs episode is a good example of this, where every character turned up for seemingly no reason just for the sake of them being there. 90% of the characters just do the same thing every episode and that's why they're there. For example how Golden Darkness is there to just do the whole 'Yeah i'm trying to kill you but i'll help you this one time' thing and how Haruna is just there for Rito to be attracted to and for them to do the same 'trying to confess but speak over each other and then be interrupted' thing which happens at least 5-10 times. Personally, as much as I love the character designs and some of the actually developed ones, most of them I don't as they're completely one-dimensional with no development and are simply there to fulfil one comedic role in each episode.Now this is a personal opinion of mine about the show. I'm not 100% as I haven't read the manga, or at least not yet, so i'm not sure if the adaptation from the manga is the reasoning but.. I don't feel as if the season should have been 26 episodes long. Getting towards the end it just felt far too dragged out. If the season had been 12-13 episodes in length I believe it would have felt like a better use of time. In these 12-13 episodes they could still have had the first 2 or so as introductions and the last 3 how they were too with actual progression. Then between this they could still have had a decent amount of the filler like, ridiculous episodes in the middle chunk. Because personally having around 20 episodes in the middle of the show be the ridiculous stuff was just far too much to sit through. However, as I said at the beginning, I haven't yet read the manga and so they may have wanted to try and keep the anime exactly to the source material which is why everything was included. But regardless, as I stated I believe the season could have been better in 12-13 episodes.Now. The harem aspect of the show really confused me. Whilst Rito was in fact surrounded by plenty of females, again most of them felt underdeveloped and irrelevant. Lala is the main female, being engaged to Rito and living with him. There is also Haruna who has a thing for Rito and Rito has had a crush on since he was a young child. There is also Run, the female version of Ren, who has a big thing for Rito, however this is only really shown in 1-2 episodes. Aside from this, everything else is irrelevant. Every other female shows no actual romantic or love interest towards Rito, as is suggested in it being a harem. The other females just pop up in episodes to push the comedy of specific situations and that's really it. So therefore you're left with Lala, who makes sense as they're engaged, Haruna, who became annoying to me as her only purpose of every coming into the episode was the crush thing between her and Rito, and also the 1 or maybe 2 episodes around Run having a crush on Rito. That's it. To me, it felt bland.Now, on the note of the harem, I unfortunately did what I decide never to do with harems and settled for the person I wanted to see the MC (Rito) end up being with. This was Lala. However, there was reason behind this. To me, it's what made the most sense. They were engaged from the start, and regardless of this being an accidental situation it was still the best choice for me. Lala and Rito grew and developed around each other. Not only were they practically the only characters to get real development for themselves and the relationship between them, but they were also the only two characters who had different purposes in different episodes and weren't just one-dimensional characters. Unlike all the other females in the show, Lala had lots of personality and developed a lot from first arriving on earth up to the end. Now there's mostly two sides to this. A lot of people want Lala and Rito to be together, and a lot seem to want Rito and Haruna together. To me, this was a big part of the plot. Due to the romance tag I was hoping for Rito to end up with someone. Also honestly Rito was a pretty hopeless MC, so I was hoping he would at least go through and marry Lala as planned.I don't like Haruna. Haruna is Hinata from Naruto but far worse. And by this I mean quite literally all Haruna does is blush and says 'Yuki-kun..', that's all. She's one of the most bland girls because that's all she does every episode. Rito only considers her because of his child crush he has had on her. That's why I always wanted Rito to take the Lala route and so the season could end with Rito ending up marrying the most fleshed out and best female character.HOWEVER.As you can imagine, this doesn't happen. I saw a lot of praise for the final episode however I wholeheartedly disagree with all of my being. I like the final 3 episodes with actual progression. Firstly Rito at last exclaims his love for Lala, bringing her back from her flu. When this happened I was finally satisfied as things were going in a good direction. However, towards the end, firstly for whatever reason Rito still can't get over his ridiculous thing for Haruna.. I understand the idea of having a crush on someone since you were young, but really? That VS actual love and care you've built up from living and spending time with someone?? Seems far-fetched. Especially when Rito barely develops anything with Haruna, he simply speaks to her a few times and even then the conversations are basically nothing. Whereas with Lala Rito lived with her, spent time with her, actually communicated with her and so had actual reasoning for his feelings towards her. Whereas the thing with Haruna is nothing more than just a crush. But regardless of that, Rito finally gets through all the trials and tribulations put forward by Lala's dad so he can have permission to marry Lala and save earth. So everything is finally going in a good, progressive direction. So what could possibly go wrong, right? Well. WELL. Last minute, quite literally just as they're about to get married, Lala for the first time does a complete 180 and cuts off the marriage. IT HURT. Her personality had remained exactly the same throughout the entire series (besides the one episode where the joke is her personality changing each day) and so it was out of no where. Rito had finally confessed his love, and then suddenly with basically no explanation given she cut off the marriage and tried to erase everyone's memories.I guess i'm just most upset because it was so sudden and there was no reasoning given outside of her briefly saying something along the lines of 'I've put Rito through a lot of pain' and that's it. Now, this is true, however that's the point! Lala was always a handful. She arrived suddenly on earth and Rito and her were suddenly engaged to be married. She was very hyperactive and crazy, doing crazy things, making crazy inventions etc. But that was really part of her charm. Lala and Rito built their relationship up from that, learning about each other, taking care of each other and spending time with each other. This led up to Rito confessing his love to her. I'm in belief that the whole reasoning is that she could see the conflict Rito felt in his feelings between her and Haruna, and that just annoys me. Because if that's the case then if Rito could have just realised that his feelings towards Haruna are pretty much completely superficial then everything could have worked out fine and the marriage could have taken place. My second theory is simply that this was done intentionally by the writers for the sake of the rest of the series as there are plenty more seasons. That i'm not sure of at the moment, but will come to find out when I watch them.But as I said earlier, Rito was a seemingly useless MC, and so all I wanted was for him to go through with this marriage so he could at least have done something worthwhile.The ending honestly just left me feeling empty. I got a similar feeling to when I watched the Oreimo ending (though i'm obviously not going into detail about that, but if you know then you know).It just made me sad.SO IN CONCLUSION:Due to everything aforementioned I found it very difficult to judge this anime. This is the first review I've done on this account and just wanted to do it since I was left with so many conflicting emotions. So overall, I really like the characters. I think that they're all very vibrant and different design wise and all fill very different roles and there is a character for each common anime trope such as a tsundere etc. I liked the art in general, it all looked pretty good consistently and there weren't any moments where I thought the animation was particularly poor. I got a relative amount of enjoyment out of the season. It was designed to be very lighthearted in many senses and just be a ridiculous, over the top comedy. So to that effect, I enjoyed it. However:As also mentioned before, I feel like either the personality of the characters should have been fleshed out and developed more as they had 26 episodes to do so, or that they should have done the same but made the season only 12-13 episodes so it doesn't feel like there's just some over abundance of filler. And finally, in terms of a romance it left me dead inside. There was one obvious choice for the MC, one in which it would have been a good ending and would have shown some kind of progression for the MC, however this was cut off literally within the last 10 minutes of the season. I'm still sad.So my overall review would be if you wanted to watch the series: If you don't mind the notion of there being almost no story progression, character development for most characters and all ideas of a romance being tossed in the trash last minute and instead you're just looking for a typical, over the top harem comedy, then this is definitely for you.Oh but also that if you end up loving Lala as is very easy to do so, and want to see the romance progress, you'll be left empty like me.As for me, I may be left dead and empty inside; but because I loved the characters and foolishly hold onto some false hope i'm going to continue to watch through the other To Love Ru seasons and maybe one day write another review for one of them if they effect me to quite the same extent as this one did. the show then don't bother, you would only be disappointed. If you are also looking for I suppose what you could consider a story and story progression then I would also not recommend this show. Aside from the introductory episodes and the last 3 or so episodes, there really isn't story progression.

Practically all the effort of the show is put into the artwork of boobs, panties, big anime eyes/hairdos and sexually provocative outfits.Sound: 7I mean, do you really watch something like this for the sound?  No.Character: 3The female character exist solely to fall down, be accidentally groped by the main character and react in an archetypal fashion, whether they\'re some variant of tsundere, or their your typical shy girl.Otherwise, they live their lives wandering around the planet occasionally having their clothes torn off or their skirts lifted up.The main male characters life consists of falling on top of these girls, groping them, and lamenting the woes of having 10+ chicks want his dick.Oh and the main character is from space but that really doesn\'t play much of a role past ""We need something to happen in between the boobs and the panties"".Enjoyment: 6I mean, at some point the enjoyment of watching our hero valiantly touch girls in inappropriate spots and then apologize dies out.  But as a man, there\'s at least some eye candy, so the show has that going for it... I guess?Overall: 6It\'s basically just fanservice.  But even fanservice can get old after a while.

Aside from an appealing art style and mildly interesting characters, this anime doesn\'t have any unique characteristics that set it apart from other anime of the time. If anything it is merely a combination of character tropes and cliches. At the end of the day this anime is very simple. Fanservice + Harem + Spineless Protagonist = $$$$. For those who enjoy shallow, fanservice based humor, I would recommend this anime.

The last epi is how she cancels the wedding, but in the book, it goes way past that! And in the epi's i dont ever recall encountering Momo or Nana. And i think...they're actually important.

First I need to ask several questions:1. Do you hate harem animes?2. Do you hate watching a lot of ecchi scenes in almost every episode?3. Do you hate watching plenty of fillers?If any of these is yes, then I recommend that you don't watch it at all because you would be wasting your time, which I think you can spend time watching other animes.Now let me put down to reason why I might give quite a high score on these one which I rarely...give to most animes I've watched(and in my favourite list btw)Most are concern of the story so I will start at that. Firstly was that the story was involving Lala, a princess alien who try to run away and escaped to Earth and met Rito by accident(which saw her naked btw). This was then accidently meant that Rito will be Lala's fiance and so the story goes on. I just give a bit of the story if and I apologise if you don't like that. The few several episode are related to the story and few in the middle and the last 3 episodes(if I remember correctly). The rest are practically fillers but if you don't mind, you might enjoy watching them. In the starting, you might find it irritating of Lala's character or the fact that they introduce a new girl in quite a lot of episodes that adds a lot to the harem group who like Rito. The story progress beautifully and the ending might be a disappointment for the ending for some of you guysYes, you got it. It will be one of the largest harem group you will ever see. But its only the first season so it won't be that much compared to the latest season where you will see there's around 15-20 girls(I lose count track of how many girls are there) that like Rito. So that make put you off for the anime but that's the fun of it. That's whats makes me entertained to watch it even though there was indeed a number of ecchi scenes in the anime.And talking about ecchi, this anime is not hentai, its ecchi. I know of that cause someone I know saw hentai b4 and it was a total different thing. And I mostly skip some of the ecchi scenes cause I am not that into such things(though some do caught me by surprise unexpectedly, mostly involving Rito)The characters are quite good and they show their feelings for Rito for the viewers quite direct and explicit. These really was something you might admire for the fact that there are really a lot of girls in the harem group. And amazingly everyone who enjoy this anime will have a favourite girl whom they thinks are better for Rito than Lala. So mine is Yami and Run. What's yours? That's up for you to decideNext the music in the anime which I think was the lack of the anime. The opening in my opinion sucks a lot and the first ED was too. I only listen to the 2nd ending quite frequently.Thus in overall I think this anime was extremely good with the romance all over the place and I really enjoy watching for most part of the anime, the big harem group and the story line the creators did. I would recommend for those who enjoy a good harem and the romance stuff but you might find the frequent ecchi scenes quite irritating so I advised you skip them(which I did).However, for those who read this and hated the anime, you've wasted your time reading this and watching the anime, I strongly suggest you watch better animes out there.

And that was about the summary of the season.Story: I probably should\'ve seen this one coming a mile away with a plot that revolves two people of the opposite gender meeting in a bathtub and then her getting the idea to get married. Is it just me or do these kids move really fast these days, I mean one minute shes naked in his tub and next thing we know she wants to get married... Regardless, this could\'ve been about half the...length but I don\'t really care one way or the other. I think that it would\'ve been better if they hadn\'t tried to reuse the same stuff over and over(and over) but most viewers don\'t pay attention to this with the boobs flashing across the screen at such short intervals. Basically this is one of those shows that is built on a solid foundation of fanservice with just enough story and humor to keep the viewer interested.Art: basically all that the animators had to be able to do here was be good at drawing circles (because of all of the boobs) and seeing as how I can do that much they should be able to, and did. Next up would be the character design which is pretty good, they make the show into a dudes paradise since there are no, absolutely no unattractive girls within a 10 mile radius of this show so I don\'t know why every guy in this is so pissed at Rito for having a few on his arm.

To Love-Ru and High School DxD are probably the two best ecchi anime that I've seen and if you're a fan of the genre at all, this is a must watch. To Love-Ru is an ecchi comedy SOL harem that involves aliens and creatures of all sorts who lead our fateful protagonist, Yuuki Rito, into countless jaw-dropping and cringe-worthy situations over and...over again. I never got tired of Rito falling headfirst into the breasts of an unsuspecting female student. And thanks to Lala's countless inventions (and the help of many alien friends/foes), the scenarios keep coming and always seem fresh. The greatest strength, by far, of the series is the cast of female characters. This is one BIG harem. There are easily 10+ women at the end (each with varying affection levels for Rito) and I can honestly say that I love them all. Each girl has a very distinct personality and ability along with different motivations and background. And they interact marvelously with each other as they try to chase Rito or fend off his unwitting sexual harassment. My personal favorites are definitely Yui, Yami, Momo, Lala, Mikan and Oshizu.The quality definitely differs from each season by getting better and better. The first season is by far the weakest and has the least to do with the manga. It's still funny and a good introduction for most of the characters but don't drop the series just because you think the first season wasn't that great as there is plenty of quality to come. The first set of 6 OVAs after the first season revert back to the manga material and this is where the comedy starts to get good and we finally get introduced to the full set of characters (for the most part). The second season (Motto To Love-Ru) swings into full force and adopts a different format from the first where each episode is broken into 3 separate independent sections that are different stories entirely. I thought that this format really allowed the comedy to come alive and keep things fresher and interesting. Also, the ecchi really starts getting pumped up in this season. The third season (To Love-Ru Darkness) is absolutely fantastic and the best of the bunch. While Motto didn't really have an overarching story, Darkness does a great job incorporating that into the fray especially by delving into and really focusing on the characters of Yami and Momo (who are two of my three favorite characters). Also, Yui Kotegawa starts to get more and more screen time (which I love). And my god... The ecchi reaches borderline-hentai levels here and it is glorious. And the last set of Darkness OVAs just keeps on bringing the same goodness.If you are an ecchi fan, you better watch To Love-Ru and don't drop it just because you think that the first season was a bit weak. Power on through. It only gets better. As the Darkness OVAs have just concluded, I hope that they announce a new season in the near future because I need my fill of the best harem in the universe getting caught up in tentacles.To Love-Ru Trouble: 6/10To Love-Ru OVA: 6.5/10Motto To Love-Ru: 7/10To Love-Ru Darkness: 7.5/10To Love-Ru Darkness OVAs: 7/10 over again.

There really isn't that much to talk about the art as it's generic.Sound :...7The OP and ED were pretty catchy (for me atleast) and the voice acting is what you would expect from a 2000s era anime.Character : 7The characters are generic and bland and... what else is there suppose to say? There's no depth to the characters. They don't even have backstories except for Lala I guess.Enjoyment : 6I wasn't mildy entertained by this anime and I could really see why so many people dropped this anime. I don't like this anime nor do I hate it. I could see this as an anime to watch when you have spare time.Overall : 7To LOVE-Ru is a generic anime with generic characters with no story. I'd recommend this to anyone who has spare time and wants some comedy from an anime. 7The OP and ED were pretty catchy (for me atleast) and the voice acting is what you would expect from a 2000s era anime.Character : 7The characters are generic and bland and... what else is there suppose to say?

To LOVE-Ru is full-on packed with all kinds of ecchi goodies, crammed tightly into a bundle of filler-esque stories to bring in humor, a bit of romance, and quite a handful of bored annoyance at your side.Like I said, the story is pretty much how you would define fillers to be. Simple episodes that were not related to the main sci-fi story that was introduced early in the anime. Which is not a bad thing in hindsight, but for a mindless entertainment of this nature, To LOVE-Ru didn't do a good...job in achieving that goal for the most part. There were a lot of repetition. Let me repeat that again. There were simply too much repetition for the show to be a fun one. It was why I was amused by the first half but as time goes on, I found myself to get annoyed with the recurrence, whether it's jokes or actions, because it won't work if you've seen it multiple times. However, there were a few episodes that I really enjoyed as I found myself laughing at the silly things that happened with the characters. As for them, it was pleasing to see that the main boy wasn't as annoying as I thought he would be. In fact, he strayed away from the major denseness found in other leads who happen to be in the same situation as him, although a couple of similarities were still present. The group of girls were likable, having personalities that were different enough to each other. However, only a couple of them had screentime so I didn't feel too much about the ones who were barely there this season.Nothing much to be said in the arts department except for the fact that it was as simple as the story. A modern take on the looks of the art style in the past. Consistency were maintained with the use of bright colors that matched with the energetic aura from the characters. Though for the animation, at times it felt dull which didn't really helped with the boring story. There were exaggeration in the comedy and ecchi scenes, as to be expected in an anime containing a lot of silliness. With fanservice, it should be unprecendented that the designs of the characters were quite proportional, including their eyes too which reaches big but not big enough to look weird. Cute I'd say, especially with their clothings as it complemented well with the personality of each characters. Same goes for the voice acting though it did took a bit of time to get used with some. While there were no notable soundtracks that I've remembered, it did removed any distractions that could possibly ruin some of the humors so that's a good thing. And for the opening and ending songs, they had a charming attitude that fit the tone of the anime if that made any sense at all.To LOVE-Ru in the end served as an entertainment that only shows and doesn't tell any progression of the story or characters. In a sense, it's just a montage of attempted humors combined with a sexy atmosphere that worked for half of the time. Do not try to find any deeper meaning in this anime and just watch it at face value. This ecchi trial of harem is awaiting you. job in achieving that goal for the most part.

It is one of the best in its genre, it is everything it proposes, all the reasons why someone would want to see an ecchi harem this anime fulfills perfectly!a really good variety of girls to pick and choose, the mc its not that boring like other harem/ecchi mc. I really rnjoy Rito actually, he´s funny and he is kind-hearted, i can kinda understand why theres a bunch of hot chiks in love w him.. LOL XDdon´t watch if you...are looking for a great, complex and deep history, you are not going to find it.

Accidental groping, panty shots and tentacle rape ensues.STORYHa! What story? The story can be summed up in 2 sentences, and is only important for about 5 episodes. A large majority of the series is episodic filler, and when i say a majority, i mean a majority. So how can I talk about the story of an anime if there isn’t even a story? Easy. I don’t.CHARACTERSHa! What characters? There aren't a whole lot of characters, and absolutely none of them are developed or super well-written. The...only one who has any semblance of a conflict is the main character. He has Lala, a beautiful girl willing to marry and have sex with him at any time, but he really has feeling for his classmate, Ms. I-forgot-her-name. The only character or story arc is the main character deciding what to do with these girls and try to make himself look good in front of Whatshername.ARTArt? The animation and sound are both passable, and the only sand-out thing about the art is the opening, and... ahem... the...FANSERVICE!You might have noticed that I haven't done a whole lot of talking about this show, because Ive been looking at it critically. Thats is clearly not the way to look at this show, because once you do, you'll notice that there is absolutely nothing this show can offer in terms of development, intrigue, or emotion. There are really only 2 things one can talk about with this show: Fan-service and comedy. Why? Because those 2 things are the only 2 things this show ever does. Although I’m more of an ass man myself, id be lying if I said i didn’t love the fan-service in this show, especially in the last episode👌. BUTT I must say this: this show is credited as being one of the sexiest, fan-serivce-y anime out there. I’m here to tell you the truth in that its not the sexiest, fan-service-y anime out there. If you’re here to exclusively watch tits and hot girls, then watch actual porn. You’re not going to find much fapable content in this anime.COMEDYThis is the other aspect of To Love-ru that really matters. If there is no story, nor character development, nor that much fan-service, then what is there? The silly antics of course! The ridiculous, zany situations are what this show is really about. Every episode has another weird and unbelievers story to it, and i must say that the humor is the best thing about the show! The jokes and situations pleasantly reminded me of western cartoons like phineas and ferb or fairly odd parents. If you, like me, enjoy that ridiculous, all-or-nothing style of humor, then you will enjoy most of this anime. With that said, there is a good mix of horrible episodes and great episodes. Some of these episodes are really fun and ridiculous while others are downright cancer.OVERALLSomething doesn’t have to be Shakespeare in order for it to be entertaining. Yes, there is no semblance of plot, character, or intelligence, but such things are expected when you have a dumb ecchi written like a dumb cartoon. I really did enjoy the humor is this show, and seeing as though thats pretty much all this show is, i can safely say that I liked this anime. If you want something smart, or well-made, then look somewhere else. If you’re looking for hot girls exploiting their giant breasts, then look somewhere else.

Trying to confess your feelings to said crush iseven harder. Having an ailen crash into your house and wanting to getmarried? How did that happen??? This is the predicament Rito finds himself in as he tries to deal with bizarre, perverted accidents added to his already-complicated adolescent life.Story (6/10) - When I first discovered this series, I had to pause and collect myself from all the seemingly perverted and awkward situations, before being able to dive back in. I was only able to get to episode 11 before calling it quits. When I came back, out of the sake...of not leaving it unfinished, I found it more enjoyable than I remembered. Story-wise, there isn't much plot; mostly fan-service and comedic situations.Art (6/10) - I'm not gonna lie. I had to pause the first few seconds of the first episode, and just GAPPED at the art of this show. It looked like something from the 90s, despite this Anime airing in 2008. I then figured that this might be the style, and found out that the adaptation was nearly spot-on.Sound (4/10) - The intro and outro of this show wasn't anything great, maybe a Little memorable, but the visuals with it were a bit much for a Romantic Comedy. Some of the gag sounds made during ecchi scenes seemed unnecessarily thrown-in that made me groan in despair rather than laugh at the main character's reaction.Character (7/10) - Seeing Rito trying to manage his normal life, the new-alien arrival, and his feelings for the girl of his dreams is an enjoyable ride despite sometimes being derailed by outside forces.Enjoyment (7/10) - When I came back around to finishing this series, I actually found that I liked it more than I thought I would. The ending was a slight surprise, yet also predictable at the same time.Overall (6/10) - A series about a boy struggling to confess to his longtime crush, and adding on an alien wanting to marry him, isn't a series everyone would like, or one everyone would hate either. Is it the worst? No, it did get my attention to find out what happens next, so we'll have to wait and see. of not leaving it unfinished, I found it more enjoyable than I remembered.

Whether it\'s the zany misadventures, the hilariously awkward scenarios, or the countless love stories connected to the male protagonist; I\'ve enjoyed the lighthearted, straightforward fun that comes out of this sub-genre!""To Love-Ru,"" is no exception to this pattern. Highly entertaining, hilarious, incredibly wacky and chock full of fan-service; this series perfectly encapsulates what good harem anime is all about! Given that we\'ve discussed a bit in terms of the nature of the show, let\'s talk a bit about its story!Rito Yuuki is our main male protagonist,...and a young man who is a bit down on his luck. He has a big crush on a girl in his school named Haruna Sarenjei, who subsequently, unbeknownst to Rito, also has a crush on him. Though they are friends, Rito cannot muster up the courage to confess his feelings to her, ultimately leaving him feeling dejected and defeated. In the midst of all this, a young princess named Lala from the planet (yes, planet,) Deviluke is fleeing her homeland in hopes of avoiding an arranged marriage. In the midst of her pursuit, she ends up on planet earth and ultimately... Rito\'s house! Shocked at this development, Rito frantically tries to keep her a secret, especially from Haruna! In haste, love, and perhaps a bit of desperation, Lala declares herself to be Rito\'s fiance, which was ultimately made official by a planetary contract with Deviluke. Lala is super cute, super funny, and any guys dream girl, right? Wrong. She is not Haruna, and our poor male MC is left to wonder if he can ever be with Haruna after the events that had just taken place.Outside of this basic plot synopsis, the story is quite loose and operates in more of an episodic fashion than anything. Rito ends up making quite a bit more friends, primarily female, ranging in their memorability and pertinence to the story. The plot as laid out above, sets up the zany adventures that Rito partakes of with his friends, or perhaps more fittingly, his harem. They do everything from fighting aliens, building robots, and going to the center of the earth, to  chilling at the beach, (because every anime needs a beach episode!) and saving the world from mass destruction. The episodic nature of this series allows for quite a bit more leniency in just how much variety and differentiation can be present with each and every episode! The subtle story lines are just that, subtle, which is perfect for this series. The wackiness and overall uniqueness of this series in its singularity is something so, so refreshing for a harem series. The planetary/alien theme isn\'t super common within the genre, and going outside of the typical trappings of school life is also a welcome change of pace from the norm!Another really awesome thing about ""To Love-Ru,"" is the likability of the characters. In any harem series, it can be really hard to like just about every girl, or even the male MC. Often times, the MC can be a one dimensional pervert, bereft of any depth as it pertains to male/female relationships. On the other hand, many harem girls can be seemingly bitchy, uninteresting, obnoxious or like our male MC, one dimensional. Though I\'m pretty lenient in my harem character studies, there\'s usually at least that one character that bothers me and falls into these aforementioned categories. I can say with confidence that this is not the case with this series. While these characters range in their memorability, they are all largely likable, kind, funny and genuine. Qualities like these can sometimes be put on the back burner so as to appeal the solely the fan service or awkward scenario\'s between the MC and the harem. ""To Love-Ru,"" balances these factors excellently, giving us a lot of fan service and zany scenario\'s, teamed up with some well developed and likable characters!Specifically, Rito, Lala and Haruna really take the cake for the most likable characters in this series! Rito is good a guy who likes girls for the right reasons, not always gawking at their bodies and external features. He\'s mild mannered, quiet and respectful, always looking out for the needs of others before his own. Lala is a fitting companion for Rito, though quite the opposite in many ways! She\'s lively, vibrant, hilarious, bubbly and honestly, a bit of a klutz! She always shows Rito affection through verbal affirmation, physical touch and various other means of flirting. In this way, she\'s much different than a lot of harem love interests. She doesn\'t incessantly beat up Rito and doesn\'t embody the typical Tsundere personality that a lot of harem female MC\'s exhibit. Haruna reminds me a LOT of Onadera from ""Nisekoi,"" (such a GREAT series!) She has a lot of similar qualities to Rito, thus they are quite conversationally compatible, sharing in an awesome friendship that develops throughout the series. We see these characters and their qualities throughout the entire series, but we also see them grow as people as the series progresses. Additionally, we see different sides of them in response to different scenarios whether good or bad, allowing for a decent amount of depth within most of the characters, especially these main three.The soundtrack to this series is very catchy and fitting for the genre, and the opening theme, ""Forever We Can Make It,"" is my favorite opening song of all time! It is super upbeat, fun and catchy, in a way, like a microcosm of the entire show. The closing theme is also solid, and likewise, upbeat!The visuals are solid, but fairly average stylistically speaking. The color palette for this series is great though! It\'s all very vibrant and colorful, to match the overall optimism represented in the show.In conclusion, ""To Love-Ru,"" receives an 8 for all of its merits and how they work well within the genre. Though I appreciated the episodic nature of this series, and the liberties it gave to various smaller stories, I didn\'t enjoy every single episode. Some episodes were long winded, or uninteresting. This is natural with shows that operate in a more episodic way, and it\'s not something I really hold against ""To Love-Ru,"" to a large extent. For the most part, this show was hilarious, fun, wacky, heartwarming and highly entertaining! Being that this show didn\'t set out to be a masterpiece, I didn\'t  expect it to be such. Within the confines of the genre it exhibited, ""To Love-Ru,"" stands tall as one of the finest harem series\' of all time in my book! I highly recommend for fans of good harem anime, romantic comedies, or just something wacky! You probably won\'t be disappointed.Final score-8 and a young man who is a bit down on his luck.

An episode is born by an alien arriving from space, mostly to ask the hand of the alien princess Lala, or just by crazy fantasies of the main characters, continuing with the never-stopping fanservice. The endings lack conclusion and often are cut halfway through, with the next episode resuming from as if nothing had ever happened previously.The art is nice, and new cute girls keep appearing, some of them alien, possessing different attributes, like jealousy, clumsiness and embarrassment - just enough to make the scenes perverted in each and every situation, just as though Lala's lack of common sense wasn't enough.There were some humorous episodes I really enjoyed watching, but there were some totally lame ones too, those that exceeded the limit of randomness and craziness.

My overall mark hangs on the seven, with the six not far below, mostly because I consider the OP to be a masterpiece."", ""When I was watching To love Ru, I struggle to finish the season as I tend to leave ecchi animes on and off. This was no different but finishing it took maybe a good 6 months...To Love Ru is by far one of the more quality finishes of ecchi anime with borderline hentai like bondage, tentacle, and of course your full nudes. But you can't absolutely force a ecchi anime to be love by all.With a somewhat random plot line it was overall kill to watch all 26 episode when the last 3 episode was what brought the whole anime to full circle but To...Love Ru stride on the its fan service to keep the audience watching.So in conclusion I would recommend watching To Love Ru for those who loves ecchi and some mild comedy but skip it if you are looking for some hard story line.Overall Rating:6.4/10 Love Ru stride on the its fan service to keep the audience watching.So in conclusion I would recommend watching To Love Ru for those who loves ecchi and some mild comedy but skip it if you are looking for some hard story line.Overall Rating:6.4/10"", ""I started To-LOVE-Ru without particularly high expectations, after some of the reviews I'd looked at prior to watching. Fortunately, I am able to create my own opinion of it after finishing - and all I can really say is, if you're looking for a deep, thoughtful anime, this probably isn't for you.Firstly I'd like to say that I haven't read the manga, so this review isn't going to compare the two, it will simply be my opinion of the anime as a stand-alone.Story - 4 - Most people seem to have a problem with To-LOVE-Ru's excessive use of fanservice. I will admit that, at times,...it got a little repetitive and boring to watch - there was no real story to most of the episodes (the majority of them were filler), however it didn't detract from the enjoyment of watching because most of it was pretty amusing. Some of the episodes are so silly you can't help but laugh at them, and the over-used panty-shots and accidental boob-grabs etc are really just a tool which makes it even more silly. So I gave the story a 4, as it wasn't really present, but what was there was fine.Art - 7 - I quite liked the art for this series, it is well drawn and animated and there is good use of chibi/exaggerated expressions. The characters are all relatively easy to differentiate between (unlike some animes I've watched, where everyone looks just about the same), which is always a plus especially if you watch the series staggered, as I did.Sound - 8 - I enjoyed the OP for this series and the original ED, the latter being very catchy and easy to get stuck in your head. Those who enjoy ecchi scenes will very much enjoy the OP, I'm sure. Not much more to say about this.Character - 5 - Two words - Yuuki Rito. Probably one of THE most annoying males in anime I've seen. He's loud, gets overly embarrassed over very little and seems to have no idea about anything even if it's obvious (Don't want to include any spoilers here for those of you who haven't watched this series yet). The rest of the characters seem very linear and generic, with a couple of exceptions. You may be wondering, after that, why I gave character a 5, and not less - the answer lies in Lala, Haruna, and most of all Zastin. Lala is sweet, but rather ditzy, which makes her extremely endearing. Zastin is just a badass, and Haruna has that kind of sweetness about her, you just can't dislike her. I think those three characters really saved the series for me.Enjoyment - 7 - I enjoyed most of the episodes of this anime, there was very few times when I wanted to drop it, however the cases when I did feel like not watching it any more was when I'd just had enough of all the darn fanservice. But I got a fair few laughs/giggles from it, even if some of them were out of disbelief!So overall To-LOVE-Ru gets a 7 - just a lighthearted ecchi-fest for those who can cope with it. Just don't expect too much of it and you will most likely enjoy it. it got a little repetitive and boring to watch - there was no real story to most of the episodes (the majority of them were filler), however it didn't detract from the enjoyment of watching because most of it was pretty amusing.

That\'s it?""Story: 6Okay, as i said before, the story is very random, means that it suddenly having this and that without proper reason, Although they introduce the...characters throughout the episodes, but it still lack a sense of common, like suddenly ""Wow, why is this happening?""

So i give it a 9.Character: 7The reason i gave the characters a 7, it\'s because each of them wasn\'t deeply developed. Except for Lala and Sairenji, the others were not appearing oftenly, which is why i don\'t much like it in harem series. If they were to make a harem, they should at least make a few more episodes to make us more understand the characters, than rather focusing on the main one, that would be unfair to the others ( especially Yami-chan, haha xD )Enjoyment: 8For me, it wasn\'t that great, mainly because of too much unnecessary fanservice. First of all, I don\'t hate fanservice, because me myself is also a fan of ecchi series, BUT, when the fanservice are more than the plot itself, it became a big problem, the plot itself are random, and that was already a problem, and the fanservice are too excessive, making the anime seems like nothing but just a bunch of fanservice, but it will be enjoyable if you like the comedy in itOverall: 7To Love-Ru can do alot more better than this one, the manga is great, but the anime wasn\'t that good because sometimes it doesn\'t make sense, which make this anime confusing a little while, but the fanservice and the comedies are covering up those holes, making this series can still stand alone itself.If you\'re going to watch this one, you should expect enjoyable yet random moments. characters throughout the episodes, but it still lack a sense of common, like suddenly ""Wow, why is this happening?""

However, I think it didn't quite manage to do a good job with that in most regards. The opening is a pretty solid set up for the premise, and the cast of characters also seems incredibly solid in general due to getting a pretty great introductions. However, beyond the introductions it felt pretty weak. The central episodes felt like they should be developing characters and relationships beyond their introductions, but it didn't really feel like they did much at all for the vast majority of characters, so most all the characters remain pretty flat. While there was relationship development and some growth in Rito regarding his relationship with Lala and Haruna, it wasn't as substantial as it felt it should have been, and certainly not enough considering the length of the show. This combined with the fact that the humor while decent wasn't enough to hold up the show, and how there were some episodes that were completely and utterly pointless, led to the pacing feeling incredibly slow. The fanservice seemed like it was supposed to save it from that, but I really didn't feel like it was enough. The ending felt like it was trying too hard to be some major epic conclusions with emotional impact, but it really didn't have the build up to feel that that was warranted so that kind of fell flat too. Hence ultimately it felt like a good introduction that took far too long.The OP is really solid both in terms of audio and visuals. The first ED song in terms of audio is only okay, though the second is pretty good, and both have pretty good visuals. Eye catches were decent but too repetitive. The art and animation felt pretty dated, even for an anime from 2008, but was otherwise decent enough. I will note though that while the character designs for the main characters are pretty solid, outside of that they're all over the place with a lot of characters feeling really random and out of place. The soundtrack was okay, in that its mostly forgettable but there's one noticeably good track. that plays a major part.

It had a lot going for it since the idea itself was something new and refreshing, being able to see your deepest desires of having a harem unfold before your very eyes was something to look forward to, but to my horror that never really happened. The main character of the story, Rito Yuuki is a complete virgin that has no idea how to act around girls, even when all of...those girls are throwing themselves at him, while it can be funny and used for comedic relief at the start, it gets boring pretty fast and I just kept on wishing he finally maned up and did something more interesting, but to no avail. Having said all that even with my crushed expectations of a dream harem I'd give this series a solid 7/10. I liked most of the characters, they each have their own distinct personalities that are all very entertaining, the comedy in this series is also quite good which in my opinion was the best part of this whole series and some of the WTF moments were on another level.

For the most part, this is not inaccurate, but when it comes to To LOVE-Ru, it doesn\'t really fit. This is an anime that is not so much horrible as it is horribly dull—an atrocity of mediocrity if you will. I\'ll get deeper into the plot and characters later but, fundamentally, the cardinal flaw with this show is that it is an ecchi series without very good ecchi. There is all the lack of plot and weak characterization you might expect from a major ecchi series, but...very little of the fanservice-filled payoff. It’s like porn without the porn—nothing, in other words. 26 episodes of vapid, vacuous, banal, stale, insipid nothingness. It is natural then that I regret watching To LOVE-Ru, for who would consider watching nothing for 26 episodes an enriching way to pass the time?Of course, To LOVE-Ru does, in fact, have the very vaguest semblance of a plot (at least in the first few episodes). Our main character, a man with a propensity for falling down on top of attractive women, is named Yuuki Rito. He lives a normal high school life... that is, until something shocking happens in the bath one day. While the unsuspecting Rito is minding his own business, a naked alien girl named Lala (who looks indistinguishable from a human besides her bright pink hair and tail) falls on top of him out of nowhere. Through a series of extraordinarily contrived misunderstandings, Rito accidentally proposes to this girl despite actually being in love with Haruna Sairenji, another girl at his school. Naturally, being utterly incapable of expressing himself to girls his age, he finds himself unable to call off the accidental proposal, and likewise unable to profess his love to the real girl of his dreams. To make things worse, the reason Lala ended up in Rito’s bath in the first place is that she is the crown princess of one of the most powerful civilizations in the galaxy––the Devilukeans––and was trying to escape a political marriage. As a result, any attempts by Rito to break off the engagement would likely offend the Devilukeans and might end not only in his death but the death of the entire world. So, with tensions as high as they are, Rito is obviously immediately inspired to go out and face his problems, clear up any misunderstandings and—just kidding, he acts like the hero he is and continues with his daily life as though nothing is wrong.Yes, while a number of other aliens show up to either try to assassinate Rito or convince Lala to cancel the proposal, and countless other girls show up and dilute the situation further, as far as progress, there is none to be seen. Instead, the show remains in an awkward limbo, with Rito clearly in a situation in pressing need of his attention yet making only the most feeble and infrequent attempts at remedying this fact. In truth, most of the episodes don\'t even mention the main plot at all. Rather, they resort to episode long filler plots which range from bad to appalling. We see everything from Lala bringing in some alien tentacle monsters (animated with horrible CG) to cook and getting groped by them instead, to some insignificant side character dreaming about being in feudal Japan.To summarize, the story is questionable and mostly ignored—there may as well be no story. But as I wrote above, in an ecchi show such as this one, sacrificing plot for fanservice is common practice—I daresay I prefer it that way. No one in their right mind would watch this show hoping for a complex or emotional story to blow them away, as that would only get in the way of what really matters here: the fanservice. What they might hope for, however, is a plot that would facilitate as much fanservice as possible. And here, is the heart of the issue. Despite advertising itself as ""a romantic comedy full of slapstick humor, sexy girls, and outlandishly lewd moments that defy the laws of physics,"" To LOVE-Ru contains a surprising dearth of lewdness. 90% of the fanservice in this series is composed of little more than panty shots and Rito being an accidental pervert by falling on top of girls, and the other 10% is rarely much better. Sometimes the series will go for almost an entire episode with very little fanservice, instead caught up in its lackluster filler plots—filler plots like the one about feudal Japan I mentioned above, which create practically no good opportunities for sexual moments. How could this become a flagship of the ecchi genre when it does ecchi in such a mediocre way? From what I have heard, this situation was largely caused by the anime deviating heavily from the manga, which is apparently much better. Certainly, if there is one good thing about To LOVE-Ru it is the character designs, which were taken directly from the manga.On the topic of characters, I think it is high time I discussed them. To get straight to the point, they are cliché and uninspired. And unlike with the plot, being ecchi is absolutely not an acceptable reason for bad characters. Series like Nisemonogatari are proof that fanservice shows are perfectly capable of having well-written and unique characters. Now, rather than talk about them broadly, I think the best thing for me to do at this point is to scrutinize each and every character in needless detail.So, without further ado, let\'s begin.Main CharactersRito Yuuki: From head to toe, Rito is comprised of little more than the standard elements of your friendly neighborhood harem protagonist. He\'s nice, bad at talking to girls, clumsy and if the size of his harem is any indication, the most attractive man in the galaxy. Only one little thing: he is absolutely, 100%, completely and fully opposed to anything even remotely sexual. Just imagining a girl in a swimsuit is too much for his sex-averse mind to handle. In this way, this show’s failures stem largely from the failures of this one aspect of this one character: someone thought it would be a good idea to make the lewdest show around about a kid who doesn’t like lewd things. It is one thing to have the protagonist of, say, a battle shounen be sex-averse, but for the main character of an ecchi anime to act that way is like trying to make a sports anime about a character who has a grudge against sports. Pure and simple: it doesn’t make any sense. I realize that such timid protagonists are not uncommon in ecchi harem shows like this, but I have always found this fact baffling, and this show certainly does nothing to reduce my confusion.Of course, the show does at least make feeble attempts at addressing this obvious contradiction, and it does so rather creatively by attempting to have Rito become the preeminent accidental pervert of the anime world. And this, to be totally and completely honest, is not actually such a bad idea. Now, instead of having some unsympathetic loser who goes around groping women as our main character, we have a fine, respectable young man who just… accidentally finds himself groping women sometimes. In a good anime, this could be a resounding success, creating lots of fanservice in an interesting way, but this is not a good anime. The vast majority of Rito’s accidental perversion takes the form of him falling on top of girls, and in doing so, finding his hands and/or face where they really don’t belong. Sometimes these scenes are amusing, but by the end, they are so overused and so rarely varied upon that they quickly become tiresome more than anything.Ultimately, Rito is mostly generic, and where he does deviate from the norm, he rarely achieves anything of particular note. With such a weak foundation on which to build the rest of the show, it is little surprise that To LOVE-Ru is so spectacularly unsuccessful.Lala Satalin Deviluke: Rito’s fiancée Lala is nothing groundbreaking either character-wise, but she remains one of the stronger characters the show has to offer. Her personality is bubbly, upbeat, and... well, not very complex, but her demeanor is so resoundingly positive that I have great difficulty maintaining any lasting dislike for her. In essence, she is a bundle of joy, and while she is not the most richly wrought character to ever come out of the world of anime, her frequent presence is one of the few features that make this slog of a show bearable.Besides her personality, the other main aspect that sets Lala apart is her inventing abilities. Though she never comes off as particularly intelligent, we are told to believe that she is, in fact, a genius who regularly invents devices capable of nearly anything. Naturally, To LOVE-Ru being the show that it is, “nearly anything” usually takes the form of a device that causes fanservice-y shenanigans in some capacity. Be it a teleporter that causes the teleportees to lose their clothes along the way, a machine that swaps the genders of its users, or a pair of glasses that allows one to see through clothes, Lala’s inventions never fail to impress. As one of the few consistent producers of quality fanservice in the show, it is always a delight when an episode centers on one of these, though like all the good things this anime has to offer, they don’t seem to appear as often as they should.Haruna Sairenji: Rito’s dream girl could best be described as blandness incarnate. The reason for Rito’s attraction to her, if we are to surmise from the two minutes dedicated to the subject during the first few episodes, is her extreme kindness. At first, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with this, but as the show progresses it becomes increasingly apparent that the reason that Rito finds her kindness to be her most appealing characteristic is largely that it is her only characteristic of note. Despite being one of the most important characters in the show, her personality can pretty comprehensively be described with the word “nice.” Though she never does anything actively offensive, her oppressive boringness made me quickly come to dislike any time she appeared on screen (which was quite frequent given that she is a major character). This dislike was only compounded by the fact that every time Rito is in her presence, he immediately becomes a blubbering, retarded cow of a human being and finds himself utterly incapable of expressing even the most basic of thoughts without stuttering seven thousand times. Even given that this kind of awkwardness is typical of anime romances, the extreme to which Rito takes it quickly makes it change from endearing and cute to tiresome and grating.Side CharactersKonjiki no Yami (Golden Darkness): The “Golden Darkness” is a cold and distant alien assassin capable of transforming any part of its body into a weapon. It was sent to the earth to murder Rito so that Lala could be married off to some other alien prince. After it meets Rito in person, however, it discovers that he is actually kindhearted, and decides that killing him would be wrong. For the rest of show it remains officially still carrying out its mission to off Rito, but really just living on earth because it has come to like it there.Oh, and it takes the form of a cute girl that goes by “Yami-chan.” Obviously. Cute girls can be cold-blooded killers too!Yami as a concept is probably the most compelling any character in To LOVE-Ru gets, though, between her appearance, her dispassionate personality, and her status as a living weapon, she draws a few too many similarities with Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion to call her wholly original. If anything, she suffers from the same issue that Rito did: as an idea, she’s not bad, and in a good anime she would be a successful character, but (as has been firmly established) a good anime this is not. She’s given none of the development a character with a setup this interesting deserves, instead mostly being used as the token deadpan girl and occasionally using her turning-body-parts-into-weapons ability for slapstick humor. If there is one character in this show who deserves to be a part of a better anime then it is surely the “Golden Darkness.”Run Elsie Jewelria and Ren Elsie Jewelria: A childhood friend of Lala’s that comes to earth aiming to woo her. Run and Ren are really two separate personalities that live in one body as an alien that switches between male (Ren) and female (Run) every time it sneezes. As an idea for a character, sneeze induced gender-bending is so bizarre that it’s hard to really criticize it, and actually, Ren and Run’s personalities are fairly unique as well. Ren tries to win Lala’s affection by performing various masculine feats in the hopes of outdoing Rito, and Run, after (unsurprisingly) falling for Rito herself, ends up becoming an idol to try and impress him. Run and Ren are among the more infrequently appearing characters in the show, but when they do appear it is always a pleasure to see them.Yui Kotegawa: Yui Kotegawa is a tsundere. By reading that one sentence, anyone could come to understand the entirety of her character, because that’s really all there is to it. There are no other nuances, no creative new takes, nothing—she is nothing more a tsundere at its purest and most creatively bankrupt. Well, perhaps I should give her at least a little bit more credit: there is, at the very least, a backstory. She is the president of the school’s morals committee and finds Rito’s accidental perversions repugnant, yet simultaneously she realizes that she is attracted to him for some poorly explained reason. Whatever her feeble reasons may be, though, the fact remains that Yui Kotegawa is a walking cliché.Mikan Yuuki: Mikan is Rito’s responsible little sister who essentially acts as his mother while their actual parents are conspicuously absent for nearly the entirety of the show. She appears frequently early on, but her influence wanes as the show progresses, to the point that she gets relatively little character development. This is really too bad, because, while not stunningly original, she has a sort of snarky air in the first few episodes which was one of the few things in this show that I found amusing. Plus, I find that it is always interesting to see the reaction of those close to harem leads as things get crazier. Alas, like so many elements of this show, any interest Mikan might have held was crushed by awful execution.Kenichi Saruyama: Saruyama is the perverted best friend at its most tired and bland. He is so bland, in fact, that he holds the impressively unimpressive distinction of being my least favorite character in this show. His personality is so utterly formulaic that it could have been replaced with countless other similar characters from other shows and I suspect no one would even notice. To make matters worse, rather than appearing infrequently for (unfunny) comic relief like most characters of his ilk do, he often appears prominently, even taking the spotlight in a few places. Not only is he the main character of the bizarre and out of place feudal Japan episode I mentioned above, but he also is the focus of perhaps the worst episode of the entire show (although there are many candidates for this), in which an ugly alien creature gives birth in the school clinic and Saruyama is forced to help with the birth and later become a father figure for the child. God knows what extraordinary lapse of judgment must have occurred for the writers to think that making an episode about a side character helping an alien give birth was what this show needed.Principal: Why does this character exist? The principal is the disgusting old man who runs Rito’s school and appears regularly as so-called “comic relief” to make public displays of his lust for high school girls. Because that’s funny. The only saving grace for this abomination of a character is that even the writers seemed to agree that he’s awful, and he doesn’t appear very often. Additionally, unlike Saruyama, when he does appear, we don’t have to suffer through entire episodes with him as the main character.Saki Tenjouin: Tenjouin is the token pretentious, arrogant “Ojou” character. When she appears, she is always accompanied by two of her lackeys and tends to spend most of her time flaunting her class and purportedly extreme attractiveness. Her main purpose, however, is to serve as something along the lines of Lala’s rival in the early part of the show. I say “something along the lines of” because Lala more or less ignores her presence, and she spends most of her time making a fool of herself in fanservice-y ways. She’s irritating, but intentionally so, and honestly the episodes where she appears prominently tend to be some of the better ones in the show, so I harbor relatively little animosity towards her.Shizu Murasame: The award for the most pointless character in this show must surely go to this ghost girl, who appears in one episode about a haunted old school building and then just sort of continues showing up for some reason. She never really contributes anything to the show—she doesn’t appear to share any meaningful relationships with any other characters, never adds anything of value to the plot, has no comedic purpose, has no interesting dialog, never plays a part in any fanservice, she simply exists. It is as though the writers felt that some scenes seemed empty, so they created a new character, but couldn’t be bothered to give her a reason to be there.Risa Momioka and Mio Sawada: These best friends and classmates of Rito exist more or less entirely to compare the boob sizes of girls in Rito\'s class… and then grope them just to be sure. Now, while I feel a deep admiration for anyone who has found a purpose in life as enviable as this, I do slightly question if this show needs not one, but two characters dedicated to showcasing it. At any rate, necessary or otherwise, these two are a staple of the show, appearing frequently to spice things up with a little sexual harassment.To sum up, most of the side characters can be defined by a few characteristics, the major characters are shallow and dull, and those characters that are interesting either appear infrequently or are poorly executed. The exact significance of having such weak characters may vary from person to person, but for me, it is the final damning blow in cementing To LOVE-Ru as a truly hopeless affair. I have not dedicated 2,000 words to lambasting these characters purely because it is fun (although to be fair, it is quite fun), but rather because I find that good characters are integral to creating a good show. Not only are they the foundation on which every other part of the work stands, they are the aspect of the work which most directly connects it to the reader. If I can empathize with a character, it makes the entire story all the more meaningful to me. And if, as with this show, I cannot connect with any characters, then it makes the experience merely a distant and pointless waste of my time.For the most part then, the character designs are really the only good things the characters have to offer, and without any fanservice of particular merit, these designs are rarely put to good use. It is, I suppose, worth mentioning that the quality of the character designs also extends to the rest of the show’s appearance—the art style is certainly one of the very few strong points To LOVE-Ru has to offer. Although this is purely speculation, I suspect that the reason the character designs and art style stand out so much from the rest of the show is that they come directly from the manga, of which this anime is likely a botched adaption. Perhaps the blame for this animated abomination does not lie with Kentaro Yabuki—the To LOVE-Ru manga’s artist—but rather with the fine folks at Xebec animation studios who thought it would be a fantastic idea to take a successful manga, use its characters and scenarios, and then make an entire season of brainless filler content instead of actually following it. Granted, I’m sure the manga is not high art either, but I am certain that it, at the very least, has the decency to compensate for its lack of depth with some honest-to-god fanservice. very little of the fanservice-filled payoff. It’s like porn without the porn—nothing, in other words. 26 episodes of vapid, vacuous, banal, stale, insipid nothingness. It is natural then that I regret watching To LOVE-Ru, for who would consider watching nothing for 26 episodes an enriching way to pass the time?Of course, To LOVE-Ru does, in fact, have the very vaguest semblance of a plot (at least in the first few episodes). Our main character, a man with a propensity for falling down on top of attractive women, is named Yuuki Rito. He lives a normal high school life... that is, until something shocking happens in the bath one day. While the unsuspecting Rito is minding his own business, a naked alien girl named Lala (who looks indistinguishable from a human besides her bright pink hair and tail) falls on top of him out of nowhere. Through a series of extraordinarily contrived misunderstandings, Rito accidentally proposes to this girl despite actually being in love with Haruna Sairenji, another girl at his school. Naturally, being utterly incapable of expressing himself to girls his age, he finds himself unable to call off the accidental proposal, and likewise unable to profess his love to the real girl of his dreams. To make things worse, the reason Lala ended up in Rito’s bath in the first place is that she is the crown princess of one of the most powerful civilizations in the galaxy––the Devilukeans––and was trying to escape a political marriage. As a result, any attempts by Rito to break off the engagement would likely offend the Devilukeans and might end not only in his death but the death of the entire world. So, with tensions as high as they are, Rito is obviously immediately inspired to go out and face his problems, clear up any misunderstandings and—just kidding, he acts like the hero he is and continues with his daily life as though nothing is wrong.Yes, while a number of other aliens show up to either try to assassinate Rito or convince Lala to cancel the proposal, and countless other girls show up and dilute the situation further, as far as progress, there is none to be seen. Instead, the show remains in an awkward limbo, with Rito clearly in a situation in pressing need of his attention yet making only the most feeble and infrequent attempts at remedying this fact. In truth, most of the episodes don\'t even mention the main plot at all. Rather, they resort to episode long filler plots which range from bad to appalling. We see everything from Lala bringing in some alien tentacle monsters (animated with horrible CG) to cook and getting groped by them instead, to some insignificant side character dreaming about being in feudal Japan.To summarize, the story is questionable and mostly ignored—there may as well be no story. But as I wrote above, in an ecchi show such as this one, sacrificing plot for fanservice is common practice—I daresay I prefer it that way. No one in their right mind would watch this show hoping for a complex or emotional story to blow them away, as that would only get in the way of what really matters here: the fanservice. What they might hope for, however, is a plot that would facilitate as much fanservice as possible. And here, is the heart of the issue. Despite advertising itself as ""a romantic comedy full of slapstick humor, sexy girls, and outlandishly lewd moments that defy the laws of physics,"" To LOVE-Ru contains a surprising dearth of lewdness. 90% of the fanservice in this series is composed of little more than panty shots and Rito being an accidental pervert by falling on top of girls, and the other 10% is rarely much better.

And while we did see some of that here, it wasn\'t ""over done"", like in other anime I\'ve seen.At first I loved this anime. A cute space girl that randomly lands on earth and almost kills the main character, mainly from his bad luck.

While you do have your standard harem style character layout, most of the characters have a great personality and I enjoyed seeing them all. My favorite character is obviously Lala.Overall this anime was a good one to watch.

I enjoyed this series enough to be able to watch it all the way to the end, due to hearing about how To Love-Ru ends up getting really good. Well... Maybe To Love-Ru Darkness will be 'really good', but I'll have to see for myself. Anyway... here's my review.Story: The plot... well, I can't say it was very thick or anything. It definitely wasn't without any story elements. It utilized its wide character variety to have multiple episodes where lots of ridiculous, funny and over the top things happen. There's underlying...storyline presence that takes place occasionally and comes to a head at the end though, but otherwise, it almost feels like most of the episodes are filler? I didn't think this was a bad thing though, cause I had a good time watching it.Art: It wasn't anything special. To be fair it's not exactly that new anymore. The way the characters were drawn and animated though, they had a lot of cute and funny moments about them just in the drawings alone. Oh, and there are PLENTY of unnecessary ecchi/nudity scenes... Which in of itself was also kind of funny.Sound: Again, just fine. Though I have to say, I find LaLa's voice to be adorable.Characters: All of the characters were very interesting, and there was a very wide variety of them. LaLa especially keeps things interesting and funny with her reckless behavior and lack of human understanding and customs. My personal favourite character was the rich princess, who like many of the series other characters, followed a cliche. That being said, I think there could have been more character development for many of the characters.Overall, I don't regret watching it. I hope To Love-Ru Darkness is better. Still, I think if you're looking for a comedy/romance harem anime, with lots of fan service and laughter, To Love-Ru is your next series to watch! I scored most of the stats at a 6 and 7, but I laughed so damn much I had to give it an overall of 8.IMPORTANT: Don't skip the To Love-Ru OVA.

Keep in mind this review is for a harem anime from a guy that has a genuine distaste for fanservice.Story: 4/10What I can give To LOVE-Ru credit for is an interesting premise with a colorful cast of characters. Rito Yuki is a less than average high school boy that through miscommunication with an alien girl somehow ends up in a situation where he needs to marry her. The large majority of the anime focuses on light comedy and ad nauseum ribaldry, once...in a while stepping away from this to create tension due to the politics and drama of this situation and what it means for Rito. The harem aspect takes time to develop but by the second season it becomes the focus and this hurts the narrative at large.Art: 7/10The art is well above comparable titles that would have come out around the same time. Animation, while not always seamless, is lively and fits the tone of each scene. The character designs are distinct enough to be memorable and the repeating environments help the viewer ground themselves in the world the story takes place in.Sound: 5/10The voice acting was fairly fine, albeit annoying at times. I suppose this is fine coming from inherently annoying characters such as the main love interest dere-dere and oujo-san character. I didn\'t find the sound effects used to be pervasive in any way, though the music in most scenes would draw my attention away from what was happening on screen.Character: 4/10The characters are written to be generally two dimensional, with most of their interactions stemming from the protagonist\'s accidental sexual assaults on them. While there\'s the potential for an interesting dynamic due to the protagonist\'s feelings for another girl and his obligation to marry this kind alien, this potential is never explored and is instead replaced with a cliche love triangle where the honest and true intentions of each character are largely kept from each other.Enjoyment:  4/10My personal distaste for boob grabs and tentacle teasing aside, I found the experience of watching To LOVE-Ru to be mildly annoying to frustratingly dragged out to an almost unacceptable degree. The majority of the anime is filler with some vague characterization sprinkled throughout.While this approach to character development may work for some, I found it to be taxing to watch and forced into several episodes to remind you that there is a story that isn\'t progressing. A good premise surrounded by cardboard cutout characters, poorly written interactions, and acceptable art makes To LOVE-Ru a ""turn off your brain"" watch.Overall:One accidental boob grab/10 in a while stepping away from this to create tension due to the politics and drama of this situation and what it means for Rito.

To be honest , I expected to watch something that was way too generic and overused from other similar anime titles  ( Trinity Seven , Monster Musume ) where the protagonist is just gradually gathering his harem but that's not quite the case here . To LOVE-Ru needs more appreciation regarding the management of the filler episodes because they weren't implemented just because the directors didn't have anything interesting to offer .

It may be the best harem anime opening of all time , not even exaggerating . A OP is one of the most important parts because it makes you wanna continue watching , many think that story and characters build a great anime but what about the opening song ??? The first impression is the most important !!!Regarding the soundtrack , it was quite enjoyable and suited good with the atmosphere , also the 2 ending songs were Okay to listen to .CHARACTERS AND THEIR PURPOSE ;To LOVE-Ru presents a great cast of characters that meet the expectations of the story and the environment that it is executed to . They all have some development , not to a great extent but that's not a real problem because this is not the real purpose of the anime .

Rito is that guy who wants to live a peaceful highschool life and finally confess to his crush . On the other hand , Lala is the playful type of girl that wants to be adventurous and outgoing . The supporting cast is also there to make moments more intense by showing off their own special identity .

Sure, there is a lot of fanservice, but I was hardly paying attention to that because the humor is so good. To LOVE-Ru doesn't have some profound story that is going to change the way you think, but it's not supposed to: it's a comedy. The aim of every episode is to get you to laugh. Now, don't take that the wrong way. The writers weren't just throwing in a bunch of cheap jokes. And while I will say the writing isn't that clever, I'd say it is clever enough. Some parts...of this series are an absolute laugh riot, in the good way.So if you have a good sense of humor and you aren't bothered by the curves of the female body, I'd say you will probably enjoy this series.

I know I did, hence the score."", 'This is a couple years after my viewing, but I thought I should say something anyways. The reason it\'s even coming up is because the show was mentioned somewhere and got me thinking about how I don\'t even remember finishing it, and I was wondering if I had dropped it. Coming here, I see that I actually did, in fact, drop it, and all of its sequels, about half way through.Why did I drop it? Because it is boring. Unbearably boring.I guess I should have seen it coming, since it\'s an ecchi. So there\'s going to be big anime tiddies and gratuitous fanservice. But the...thing is, Kill la Kill is also an ecchi, and KlK is fucking awesome.So what does KlK do right that this show does so horribly, horribly wrong? I\'m not completely sure, probably because it\'s been so long since I last attempted to watch it, but there are things in this show that irked me from the first episode.First of all, nothing ever happens. From the first episode, we\'re introduced to this impossibly clumsy protagonist, who always manages to fall onto random women, with his face ending up in either their crotches or their big anime tiddies. Then the girl screams and Johnny Bravo\'s him, and he feels embarrassed until the alien girl (can\'t even bother to remember her name. Lala?) bursts into the room with some insane shenanigans that either blows up the area or results in an alien coming to challenge the guy for her hand in marriage, despite the fact that she is completely head over heels for the protagonist and will obviously not go for the challenger no matter how badly they kick the protagonist\'s ass, either because she\'s a rebel or because she\'s eccentric, I don\'t remember. This happens EVERY. SINGLE. EPISODE. It\'s ridiculous.I feel like this show has an element of tongue-in-cheek to it, like it\'s not taking itself seriously, but at the same time, I feel like they got the execution completely wrong, so it ends up being boring instead of funny. I only managed to put up with 15 episodes before I dropped it.oh...that was like two things...I also put some comments on my list entry. I usually do this for the REALLY good/bad shows as a ""note to self"" in case I forgot why my opinion was so extreme. If that makes any sense. I feel like my fresh commentary from the time will help. Maybe. Here\'s what I wrote:""It took me 7 months to watch 15 episodes. This show is so boring that I just can\'t do it. Every episode is the same.

Armitage III,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1079/Armitage_III,"['I will admit that I\'m a fan of cyberpunk in its many forms, from novels by the likes of William Gibson and Iain Banks to movies like Blade Runner and Mad Max. As a child of the 80s, these were mainstays in my entertainment repertoire. By the time Armitage III was released in February 1995, I had already been exposed to titles such as Appleseed, Battle Angel Alita, Cyber City Oedo 808, Genocyber, AD Police Files, and those classics Akira and the Bubblegum series.Now, given the time of it\'s release, much of the hype of that moment centred around the forthcoming Ghost in the Shell,...set to be released later that year. Because of this, Armitage III has been somewhat left by the wayside when it comes to mid 90s anime, especially given the huge marketing campaign devoted to GitS. This irony is that of the two major cyberpunk releases of 1995, Armitage III just pips GitS as being the best of that year.The story is set in the year 2046 in the city of Saint Lowell, on the planet Mars. Earth has become overpopulated, and Mars has subsequently been terraformed to deal with this issue. Humanity was aided in the terraforming process by the first generation of androids, and by the time of the story the second generation of androids had become widely used for service and pleasure purposes. Unfortunately, Mars has been suffering from declining birthrates, and whilst the planet is autonmous from Earth, this fact is one of the main drivers for the story.The plot is well thought out on the whole (barring a few inconsistencies), and the pacing is very good. There is a nice mixture of action and intrigue, as well as a dollop of political machinations (nowhere near as much as GitS though). The story does suffer from its flaws, however the premise is one that is just as plausible as GitS and, given the advances in medical science since 1995, may prove far more ""real"". The biggest irony is that both Armitage III and GitS ask the question ""What is life?"", but approach the answer from different angles.The animation is very well done on the whole. AIC, who are also responsible for AD Police Files, Bubblegum Crisis and Now & Then, Here & There, have done a great job animating the show, however there are some moments when the animation loses its polish. The backgrounds are nicely drawn and are generally atmospheric, but they lack the detail that is one of the hallmarks of GitS.One of my biggest problems with this series was the design of Naomi Armitage. The other characters were quite well done on the whole, however I initially had difficulty taking the show seriously given that her outfit seems more appropriate for a dominatrix than a police officer. It may be that the designers wanted to emphasise that Naomi is different from other humans by garbing her in very little, however they seem to have forgotten about the utility of clothing in their approach.The sound is generally very good throught the OVA. The music is very much of the time, so lots of beats are prevalent in many of the actions scenes. The sound effects are well handled on the whole, however there are moments when the sound and music can clash quite badly.As far as characters go, Ross Syllabus is very much a stereotype - an honorable and decent man who unfortunately hates robots and androids (although he has his reasons for this, and the series tries to explain them to a degree).Naomi Armitage, on the other hand, is very much a tomboy. Brash, cocky, somewhat arrogant, and very often wilful, she seems to be just another normal, albeit unusually dressed, human being. It\'s not until the last two episodes that we begin to see more of her true character, however this is still not enough to ensure that the audience can relate to, or sympathise, with her.Aside from these two, there are sundry other characters who play their part in the OVA, the chief one being René D\'anclaude - a man who has been targetting and murdering specific women on MARS.Although I had some difficulty at first, I thoroughly enjoyed this series and it\'s sequels. The balanced mixture of action and drama could have been improved, as could the characters, however that would have needed at least 12 episodes to achieve.There\'s a definite appeal to the show because of its scripting and unusual (for anime that is), premise. As it\'s only a four part OVA, there isn\'t really any time for any real development ofthe characters or the plot, however this is purely a perceptional issue, and one that I can ignore in favour of being entertained.With inspiration drawn from many sources, like I, Robot by Isaac Asimov and Neuromancer by William Gibson, this OVA is one of the reasons why GitS became so popular here in west. Even by todays standards the story holds up well, whilst much of the artworks bright and cheery palette belies the story\'s much  darker plot.Who says cyberpunk is dead? set to be released later that year.

At the core this is a standard cyberpunk romp about the complex role of ever improving technology in human society, in this particular case it\'s about incredibly advanced androids that are not much different from humans in their make-up and functions. I don\'t think there\'s much wrong with the plot since story is not the highlight this time and more of a vehicle for stylized action that\'s occasionally mixed with some noir and drama.Art\\animation - I\'m not quite sure who did the character designs for this show...but sometimes it felt like it was done by two different people. The show is not entirely consistent with its style so some main characters fit this archetype of 90s fashion with sci-fi elements, particularly strong on the titular Armitage but a lot of side characters kind of dress like normal people. Same with world design, even though there\'s a lot of future elements like floating city blocks, abundance of neon signs and such there are also pretty normal looking bars and offices so I\'m not sure if there was one clear vision of what the world of Armitage should look like. If there was a clear distinction between what\'s futuristic and advanced and what\'s old and decrepit then it would contribute something to world building and atmosphere but as is it just feels like another part of the show that creators didn\'t much care about. Also even though Armitage looks solid for overwhelming majority of the run it also has some moments where characters looks so out of proportions that it hurts to look at.As far as animation goes it\'s about as good as you\'d expect from a 90s OVA, lots of detail, pretty fluid too but it lacks flare and style to be really memorable. So, it\'s not exactly bad but without proper direction it won\'t be impressing anyone. To be a single action scene from Mezzo DSA overshadows all the ""sakuga"" moments in Armitage because of this.Direction - this is where I want to kind of continue talking about the art while also bringing up music and some of the story though this will be spoiler free.The direction is probably the biggest flaw in this OVA, as I mentioned in the beginning, I don\'t think there\'s much in terms of plot that keeps this from being an entertaining sci-fi action OVA but all of the potential is squandered thanks to bad direction. First of all the pacing is too slow, even action scenes feel dull when the director and editor don\'t care to depict urgency, intensity or danger involved. It\'s horribly mundane and unexciting and music is only making it worse. While on its own it\'s not necessarily bad, when paired with scenes where it\'s used I felt like someone just looked at the scenes and thought it\'s getting too quiet so they just randomly slapped the first bleep bloop track they could find. It doesn\'t fit the mood or action so what\'s the point? My next issue with direction is editing, I started paying more attention to it towards the end where the flaws became too bad to go on unnoticed and sometimes the choices made were flat out baffling. Like in episode 3 I think there\'s a relatively important action scene with higher stakes than most other fights prior but we cut away from it to boring investigation work, just why? Other time the faults were less egregious but there\'s still plenty of amateurish cuts that disrupt the flow of action as well as spacial continuity. The last complaint is that it\'s just not interesting to look at. There are too many shots with boring framing that give you nothing to look yet they linger on as if you\'re shown something important. One shot stood especially stood to me when it was like a 2 or 3 seconds long still shot of an almost completely brown back alley with 5 inches of some neon sign in the upper left corner. That scene was so dead and boring that it took me out of the show. It might sound like a nitpicks but I\'m only mentioning it cause it\'s bad and it\'s common so stuff like that builds up.Writing - no surprises here cause pretty much all you need to know how this is gonna go is in the synopsis already. The show doesn\'t get too deep and it\'s better for it cause otherwise they\'d be encroaching on the territory that\'s already been covered by far better written sci-fi classics like Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. The script is kind of cheesy and very much in your face at times but I don\'t think the show pretended to be more than it is and wrapped it all up in the end, can\'t say it was entirely satisfying but when you got a show that can\'t offer and interesting story, doing as little to create more problems is fine.Fun factor - this is the part where I\'m supposed to justify why I still gave it a 5 cause so far it seems like a bunch of negatives and not really anything to justify it. No matter how underwhelming the execution is I think it still works as a cheese little sci-fi romp that can be a fine casual watch. It\'s not good but it\'s not offensively bad either so if it peaked your interest in one way or another it\'s worth to have a go at it. but sometimes it felt like it was done by two different people.

At times I was under the impression that it is maybe too much influenced by Hollywood movies such as Blade Runner or AI but in the end, the story is well constructed and presented through the 4 OVA's. This is well explained with the use of the great animations. This came out in 1995 and it looks amazing for its time. The high amount of details is very impressive and you can see another anime that influenced The Matrix with the now famous green...data line flowing down the visor. The faces of the characters are a little sharp and maybe needed a little polishing but that's a minor detail. The sound was awesome. Industrial and some metal riffs fit any cyberpunk anime like a glove. As far as characters go, only Armitage is worth mentioning. Ross is ok to see as the tough (yet soft on the inside) cop but Armitage is the real star of the show. She's sexy, badass and an attitude that would even make Alucard shit his pants. You don't mess around with her.In conclusion, Armitage III is awesome. Any SF/cyberpunk anime lover should see this. Great visuals, great OST and a memorable main character bring this anime a big well deserved 10. data line flowing down the visor.

Great visuals, great OST and a memorable main character bring this anime a big well deserved 10."", 'Armitage III: Where\'s Armitage 1 and 2?Okay, so let me get this straight...it\'s 1995. There\'s this anime about a hot, skimpily dressed cybernetic police officer with her large, strong as hell partner trying to stop a terrorist that\'s trying to shake the political scales of the world in the distant, but not too distant future? Oh, Ghost In The Shell, right? Well, you\'re half-right, but the anime I\'m referring to is a 4 episode OVA called Armitage III...which in all actuality came out before Ghost In The Shell.At any rate, the plot revolves around a former Chicago police officer named Ross Sylibus, who is...transferring to a police department on a Martian colony after his partner on Earth was killed by a robot. However, it doesn\'t take long for Ross to get thrown into action as a country singer that was on the same flight to Mars as Ross is murdered. While in the baggage claim, Ross runs into the murderer and his new partner at the MPD, Naomi Armitage. When Naomi tries to stop the murderer, they discover he\'s transporting the body of the country singer in a suitcase. The murderer gets away, however, Ross and Naomi discover that the singer was in all actuality a robot that is labeled as a ""Third,"" a model of robots that are illegally produced and indistinguishable from humans. Through an illegal broadcast, the MPD (Martian Police Department) discovers that the ""murderer"" is a man known as Rene D\'anclaude and his objective is to kill all of the Thirds since they aren\'t real humans. It is up to Ross, Naomi, and the rest of the MPD to discover D\'anclaude\'s plot and bring a stop to his reign of terror.I can honestly say that the best part of this series was its plot. This plot was really interesting, especially if you love cyberpunk anime. This series seems to have a lot of sci-fi elements reminiscent of Phillip K. Dick\'s ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" (which inspired Total Recall), Isaac Asimov\'s ""Robot Series (inspired I, Robot),"" and even a little bit of William Gibson\'s ""Neuromancer."" Getting back to the plot though, I can get invested in a good futuristic cyberpunk cop drama, and that\'s definitely what we have here with Armitage III. As I watched, I wanted to know more about this environment. This series throws at us a Martian colony, robots and cyborgs, and explosive action to go with its investigative mystery. The more I watched, the more I wanted to know about this environment and its characters.On the whole, I was really intrigued about the characters. Of course, this series shows off its lead female the most. Naomi Armitage is...well...flashy to say the least. She\'s a cop with a feisty attitude and a rather unorthodox getup (which Ross comments on the first time they meet). However, underneath her rough and rigid personality is someone who is facing an emotional breakdown and suffering from an identity crisis due to her in all actuality being a Third. Ross on the other hand is a level-headed officer that tries to keep Naomi in line, but also deals with his own inner demons as he has a hatred for robots due to his dark past, but also has to come to terms with it when he realizes Naomi is a robot. (P.S. While I know this might rub off as spoilers, these events take place within the first half-hour). Even the antagonist, Rene D\'anclaude was an intriguing character with a sadistic personality. It was interesting to see how his character unraveled...although the series still left us with a lot to be desired from all of these characters.The best way I can describe the overall production from AIC was...well, good, but not great. The animation is solid, but not breathtaking...at least not in comparison to something like Ghost In The Shell that came out that same year. The seiyuu work I thought was actually pretty good. Yasunori Masutani (Guseong from Psycho-Pass) as Ross, Hiroko Kasahara (Magdalia from Rurouni Kenshin) as Naomi, and Ryusei Nakao (Freiza from Dragonball Z, Mayuri from Bleach) as Rene played their roles extremely well. I really bought into all of their characters. The support work was decent but nothing too memorable. I was actually pretty impressed with the music for this series even though I did feel the main theme did get a little repetitive (which I personally didn\'t mind since I kinda liked the song). However, the one thing I will say is it\'s a fairly ""techy"" soundtrack, so if you\'re looking for a more refined, artistic soundtrack like you would hear in Ghost In The Shell, you won\'t find it here.Unfortunately, this OVA\'s biggest problem is it\'s way too condensed. This series has a massive plot and it has a fairly rushed feel to it. When the series was over, I wanted to know more about the setting. Why there is a Martian colony, what is the political scale of this colony in regards to Earth (which is looked at a bit in episode 4), what is the Earth\'s stance on robotics, etc. Those are just a few of the questions on my mind that lingered and I wanted to know a lot more about Ross and Naomi as well. They both had interesting back stories but neither was properly hashed out due to time restraints. This series would have worked so much better as a 12-13 episode series because it had a lot of ground to cover for a 4 episode OVA. Even Rene\'s character motivations seemed confusing because it didn\'t seem like they had enough time to touch upon it completely. Even when Asakura was introduced later in the series, I was still confused as to what the connections were between him, Rene, and Naomi. That\'s another one of my complaints. I hate saying this since it\'s usually an ugly label to give a series, this OVA had some plot holes and unexplained or unclear character motivations. This series takes a twist later on that I was baffled by because I couldn\'t figure out the complete reasoning behind it. By the time it was all said and done, I was wondering why this series took such a steep political twist and then didn\'t properly develop the reasoning for it. I wouldn\'t say it completely detracted from the viewing experience, but I couldn\'t help but ask these questions as the OVA came to a close.All-in-all, Armitage III is a pretty fun viewing experience. I can\'t say I\'m the biggest fan of the older, cell animated series out there but I still enjoyed Armitage quite a bit. While yes, the plot holes and unexplained character motivations bugged me a bit, I was still enthralled with it due to having a well-played pair of protagonists and a intriguing, sadistic antagonist with a mysterious motivation. I came for the plot and the characters made me stay. While I know this did get a summary movie as well as a sequel, this is one OVA series I\'d really like to see turned into a full series because there is a lot of material here to work with that can be properly hashed out over 12-13 episodes. Still, if you\'re a fan of cyberpunk anime, especially something like Ghost In The Shell, this might be worth a watch. I wouldn\'t put this on the same artistic plane as GITS...not by a long shot. However, if you\'re looking for a few hours to kill, Armitage is certainly not a bad way to kill it. transferring to a police department on a Martian colony after his partner on Earth was killed by a robot.

I wouldn\'t say it completely detracted from the viewing experience, but I couldn\'t help but ask these questions as the OVA came to a close.All-in-all, Armitage III is a pretty fun viewing experience. I can\'t say I\'m the biggest fan of the older, cell animated series out there but I still enjoyed Armitage quite a bit. While yes, the plot holes and unexplained character motivations bugged me a bit, I was still enthralled with it due to having a well-played pair of protagonists and a intriguing, sadistic antagonist with a mysterious motivation. I came for the plot and the characters made me stay. While I know this did get a summary movie as well as a sequel, this is one OVA series I\'d really like to see turned into a full series because there is a lot of material here to work with that can be properly hashed out over 12-13 episodes. Still, if you\'re a fan of cyberpunk anime, especially something like Ghost In The Shell, this might be worth a watch. I wouldn\'t put this on the same artistic plane as GITS...not by a long shot. However, if you\'re looking for a few hours to kill, Armitage is certainly not a bad way to kill it.', '“I wish I had no brain to think and worry.” — Naomi ArmitageAh, the age-old dilemma of being human (or a robot emulating a human), that which separates us from the animal kingdom — namely being, our superior cognitive abilities — is the same variable that alienates us, as well.  We have the capability of creating fantastic technological instruments to ease our lives, yet those same instruments have the ability to “replace” our  intended “purpose” of existence.  From a biological perspective, we tend to believe in passing on our genes to future generations in a process known as procreation.  The sense...of “fulfillment” gives us great pride, yet evolutionary theory does not adhere to a designed “purpose,” nor does it care how genes are passed on, or if they are passed on at all.Faced with the prospect a diminishing/stagnant population, the Mars colony deems it “necessary” to hasten their biological development by means of using advanced robots (otherwise known as: “thirds”).  The ethical/sociological dilemma’a comes to the fore when job displacement becomes an issue, and feminists begin to protest as their “woman-hood” is supplanted by the female “thirds.”  The absence of purpose is evident from the outset, as numerous people define themselves — and take great pride — through their job, or their capacity to start a family.  Think about it: how many times does a person ask you what you do for a living, and you responded promptly with, “I work at [fill in the blank.]”  We tend to believe we have a life outside of our job, but the fact remains: without a job, we cannot live as we please.  As of writing this review, our very own society will be facing this same predicament as automated cars replace truckers, robotic arms replace surgeons, and artificial wombs (potentially) replace human conception.The political easement of the people’s woes through the faux slogan, “one world, one nation,” as they eliminate their enemies with, “coincidentally” enough, their own robots, highlights the hypocritical nature of politicians and national governments.  The Earth Federation Chairwoman, like many politicians, appears before a crowd with a sense of dignity and virtue, but behind the scenes, loose ends are being “taken care of,” for the “betterment” of society.The characters of the show are fairly interesting, as we get some useful insights into their motivations and their uniquely distinct characteristics.  Armitage, while being a robot, struggles with the same basic questions that plague the majority of humanity: why do I exist?  There are no easy answers, but it sparks the audience to ask the question themselves, and where the line between robot and human should be drawn?  Ross Sylius, in a weird way, represents the anime public, as he falls in love with an “artificial” girl, someone who is not “human.”  Think about it: he married, and impregnated his waifu.  Well done, sir.  Well done.Final thoughts…A fascinating anime relic from the past, Armitage III resembles the highly popularized Ghost in the Shell, but, interestingly enough, its first episode predates the latter’s release.  Coming from the mind of Chiaki Konaka — who would later write Serial Experiments Lain, several episodes of Texhnolyze, and Digimon Tamers — it’s no surprise the series deviated from the high-paced action sequences, to a philosophical view of the human condition.  That being said, it suffers from a surface level approach to its own philosophical themes; thus, leaving the viewer yearning for something more substantial.  Also, the story seems sporadic, at times.  Giving the impression of poor planning on the staff’s part.  But given the brief nature of the show itself, it did a fine job of accomplishing an entertaining action-drama with philosophical musings, and sociological ramifications of proliferating technology.In addition, that opening theme song is fantastic.  I understand it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but I absolutely love it.

People on Mars eventually become paranoid about these very human looking androids, causing riots and lynch mobs to burn the &quot;Second Types&quot; in mass quantities. The androids begin to resist the only way they can, by evolving into a new class of Android the &quot;Thirds&quot;. A group of these &quot;Third Types&quot; begin to murder humans in retaliation for the way their kind is treated. The &quot;Thirds&quot; are soon classified as unlicensed androids, for the simple fact that they not only look, but act exactly like human beings.Upon arriving on Mars Detective...Ross Sylabus is thrust in to the middle of a baffling murder, which eventually spawns an investigation into the mysteries of the &quot;Thirds.&quot; During this encounter at the Space Port he stumbles upon his new partner; Naomi Armitage, a young girl with what you might call an outgoing personality.Being the typical Human of the times Detective Sylabus is openly prejudiced against all androids, but ironically finds he is becoming more and more like those things that he hates. As the story moves forward Detective Sylabus finds that his body is slowly being replaced by cybernetic implants, and is forced to confront many of the same feelings and bigotries that androids deal with on a daily basis.Arimitage though, is in actuality a &quot;Third Type&quot; android, one that possesses a secret that if revealed, will thrust both of them head long into an adventure that could easily lead to their destruction.DARGON / Tera-Alpha's Notes:This is my favorite Anime Movie!

I\'m not sure it is possible for me to distance myself from that bit of affection in writing a review, but I have seen it many times since and it remains among my favourite and most esteemed works. Not for its story or art, in which it has surely been outdone by others, but for its sheer visceral feeling.To clarify, I must make two suggestions. The first is...to be certain that you watch the four-part OVA, rather than the film (Polymatrix), as the latter leaves out enough material to be a disservice. And secondly - very importantly - do yourself a favour and watch it subbed. The dubbed version, as so often is the case, is languid and uninspired. The original Japanese language voice-actors did a very fine job and you will benefit from their efforts. I believe that between their very well characterised acting and Hiroyuki Namba\'s excellent original score, much of what may be perceived as deficiencies in the animation are more than made up for.I won\'t be reviewing the plot here, as it is straightforward and much is written on it already. What I will say is that the story covers a number of very important and often divisive issues, namely how we treat the ""other."" In the best tradition of sci-fi we find androids used as a stand-in for the minority or immigrant population of your choice. ""They\'re taking our jobs,"" ""they\'re sub-human,"" ""they\'re here for our use,"" and ""they couldn\'t possibly produce great works on their own,"" etc. Not only is Armitage one of these minorities, both in fact and as analogue, but she is in addition a female. Doubly a second-class citizen! And yet imbued with indomitable character tempered with sensitivity, great power balanced with compassion. Ross, likewise, is a fantastic bridge between human (or white/male/majority) and android (non-white/female/minority), for despite his prior prejudices, he uses the best human qualities of reason, empathy - and ultimately - love, to guide his relationship with Armitage. In many ways the cop-buddy human/non-human pairing owes a lot to ""Alien Nation"" (1988) and ""Mann & Machine"" (1992). From the looks of it Armitage has likewise gone on to influence the upcoming ""Almost Human"" (2013).A great many comparisons can also be made between Armitage and Ghost in the Shell, but here I will attempt brevity and say that while GITS is cerebral, Armitage is emotional. If GITS concerns itself with the nature of the soul, Armitage looks at what it means to have a heart. Despite all the similarities between the two franchises, in some ways they could not be more different. We accept Kusanagi Motoko as human because she is, though she often behaves more like a machine herself; while Naomi Armitage is not human at all, but behaves more like one than ""the real thing."" She embodies some of the quintessential essence at the core of the cyberpunk genre. What is it to be human? If you can\'t tell the difference, what\'s the difference? It is this last that, in my opinion, Armitage III examines perhaps better than any other work, on par with Bladerunner itself. One really can\'t give much higher praise than that. to be certain that you watch the four-part OVA, rather than the film (Polymatrix), as the latter leaves out enough material to be a disservice.

Sadly it came out about the same time as the original GHOST IN THE SHELL, and was overlooked for the overrated Ghost in the Shell movie.  The story is far better, truly delving into whether machines are alive or not and could they be considered human, along with many other questions.  Can they fall in love, or even have children.  Then there are the two main characters, Naomi Armitage and Ross Sylibus.  They add depth and bring life to the story.  The action is great keeping you watching even in the...quiet times of the anime.

It was one of the first cyberpunk animes to feature a strong female character (coming out the same year as the first Ghost in the Shell movie). However, it typically receives much less attention. It takes place on the planet Mars, and plays out in a ""buddy cop"" detective style.Detective Ross transfers to the Mars police force trying to escape his mental anquish he feels from his former partner being killed by a cyborg. His new partner is a woman named Armitage who is secretly a ""third type"" robot...masquerading as a human.

Only room for one cyberpunk epic and unfortunately, this anime would of came out on top if it was any other cyberpunk anime.For one the story is above par, for both a 90s OVA and a cyberpunk anime. Written well, cute snappy dialogue, no plotholes that were particularly unsettling (but strong inferences are needed when some events lead to the next) and the cyberpunk compulsory themes of government/ megacorporation conspiracy and robots vs humans in the battle over who possesses...more humanity. Not everything is fully explained to a satisfying depth; whether the characters or the premise that features political backgrounds fit for a 18 episode series rather than just 4 ovas (in fact, this aspect is only explored in the final episode). Despite all the material they had to fit into 4 ovas, pacing is done very well but it does jump from detective story to full blown conspiracy thriller halfway through.The characters are very solid considering the run length of the ova. Armitage is a female cop in red latex; Streets of Rage memories! But just as SoR is a brilliant game, Armitage is more than just a smutty punk girl turned detective. Her rebellious attitude is merely a cover or response to her more sensitive side. A side that drives the themes of the anime. The male protagonist, Roy also develops his character in tandem to Armitage. However, the villlains are definitely underdeveloped if not relentless and unsettling!Art is on the upper side of the spectrum when it comes to mid 90s anime OVAs. This anime is rather bright and vibrant compared to many other cyberpunk animes but the atmosphere is still there. However, it is not quite up there with the technical and visual brilliance of 90s movie level animation. Polish and detailing drops off at certain scenes. The mechanical and aesthetic design itself is more or less slightly above average for cyberpunk (AKA still really fcking awesome).I put far lower scaling on how my rating for music affects the overall score of an anime as I generally just don't care for anime music or film scores in general. This is as of the time of this writing, the only instance where that low scaling has worked against the anime. Personally I enjoyed the ost as a whole far more than any other anime ost. Its a nice mix of techno, synth rock, film score and acid jazz. For the unconventional rock fan who likes abit of jazz or synthesizer in their music.Other things to note? The movie version condenses the ova down (I know we needed more expansion on the franchise but at the same time, it wouldn't hurt to streamline some scenes). It also has an unique introduction scene, extra scenes for Roy's flashbacks and a changed and shortened ending. Though far from a mindless action romp; there will be enough action scenes if that takes priority for any viewers out there.Recommended to fans of cyberpunk and retro sci fi (anime). more humanity.

Konaka, who is probably best known for his scripting on Texhnolyze—a superior work that is certainly a lot more artistic. Armitage, on the other hand plays out like a hollywood hardboiled detective story, just updated with cyberpunk themes and gloss; entertaining enough, but the story becomes muddled and kind of pointless the more we learn about what\'s really going on. There will be some minor spoilers here to talk about the themes, but most of this is revealed pretty quickly in the story or is obvious, and Armitage III is not so much about the...story—it\'s about the visuals, the action, and the experience.The character Armitage follows the trend of female characters in other cyberpunk productions from the time—most notably Ghost in the Shell: a focus on sex appeal, skimpy clothing, and a frame so lithe you wouldn\'t expect her to be able to put up a fight against a nursing home patient, but she\'s badass enough to take on a small military! She tries her hardest to act cute and is very childish; of course, she\'s also an android, and due to the social climate, that makes her neurotic and insecure. Her background and how she ended up as a police officer is never clear, and her backstory seems to have been an afterthought.The other detective is a huge lunkhead named Sybilus, who was designed to be as big as was realistically possible to contrast with the tiny stature of Armitage. His backstory indicates his wife (???) was probably killed by an android, so he HATES THEM WITH A PASSION. This is basically explored in a 10 second dream sequence, he says stuff like ""DAMN ROBOTS, KILL THEM WITH FIRE AND TURN THEM INTO SARDINE CANS!"" and people on the force that he has only spoken with for like 5 seconds reference his backstory randomly like they\'ve known him for years. He sort of has an identity crisis as his human parts are replaced in the line of duty, and he starts to feel more robotic, and Armitage is just so cute that he wants to mate her, so any hatred he has is dissolved pronto. Eh, there could have been a lot more conflict here and more natural character drama or philosophical considerations, but he\'s not all that well-written. I don\'t find the romance all that believable, and it\'s frankly a little gaggy.In fact, none of the characters are especially well-written, but they have quite a presence, and they do a lot of scenery chewing that allows one to easily nod along to the wonderfully realized futuristic world, complete with upside-down and vast cityscapes, holograms, female androids with funny little protruding elements on their heads, Martian landscapes, and really some of the best cyberpunk imagery you\'ll see outside of Bladerunner, GITS, Akira, or a few other select titles, reinforced by pulsating synth rock; plenty of fast-paced action with good animation and enough explosions to sate Michael Bay; and even some interesting, though somewhat half-baked thematics along the way. It\'s well-paced and directed as well, so it holds up favorably compared to most OVAs of the time period.Speaking of scenery chewing, the villain D\'anclaude has one of the most over the top performances, bringing to mind the manic portrayals of the Joker from Batman (notably, Konaka also is known for doing a lot of the writing for MECHA BATMAN, AKA Big O) or some silliness like that—he always does his trademark—VERY GRATING WARLOCK-LIKE—cackle, yells one liners, and does that insane anime look where he makes one eye bigger for maximum intensity. It gets hammy as hell. He spends the whole OVA brutally murdering android women in lurid pulp fashion.We do have the typical plight of cute android girls wondering why they were created, wanting to become human, being so conflicted, you wonder why they were programmed to replicate women so well that they\'re basically all mentally ill basket cases, etc. What does it mean to be human? I mean, she\'s basically entirely the same as a human in this, they just remind us otherwise by showing an exposed metal chassis under damaged skin and SUPERHUMAN strength. There comes a certain point where the question loses all meaning, and that is the case here.On Mars, the birthrate is low, and for some reason, no one wants to immigrate to a desolate, dystopic Martian hellhole, so most of the themes are related to automation and reproduction. Humans are mad that androids are stealing their jobs, so they riot and destroy androids. It\'s hilarious how much of a background element this is, and you never see police enforcement at all. But no amount of cute android girl uwu moments are going to make me care, and I rejoiced in the wrecked, burnt-out, and twisted frames of the androids—the word for them is SCABS and home wreckers. There was an opportunity to add a balancing act with some kind of civil rights movement... but that\'s not really there, and instead there\'s something vague about ""feminism,"" which in this case pertains to human women wanting sexy female androids genocided, so I guess that\'s why there isn\'t a backlash against the riots? I don\'t know.The really odd part of the script is that there is only one female human interviewed on television indicating this message, there is the female president (who looks like an Americanized Margaret Thatcher) of the earth federation, which is part of what is leading to a Martian policy shift, complete with a Martian politician blushing about how Martian society isn\'t feminist enough and putting a hand behind his head like he\'s embarrassed in typical anime fashion; and there is Sybilus\' wife who has no dialogue. These are the only REAL women in the whole 120 minute OVA, appearing for barely even 2 minutes of screen time! All other women are androids.There\'s really no contrasting femininity to Armitage\'s synthetic charms. And that brings us to the other amusing aspect of the show. The so-called Third androids replicate humans so well that they are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing AND they can reproduce with men. The idea was just to make female sex androids for reproduction. This could be seen as a critique of feminism—women entering the work force and clamoring for equality (or female dominance), leading to a decline in family formation and birth rate. Yet... the Third android women are all pretty much feminist role models. A career woman/CEO, independent women, a butch lesbian painter, etc. ONLY ONE OF THEM IS EVEN PREGNANT, AND NONE OF THEM HAVE KIDS! Would the Third ever have even made a dent in the population issue with expanded production? Doesn\'t seem so.The story holds together well with the gumshoeing, but it\'s a mess by the second half, once all the conspiracies emerge. It appears the reason for the assassinations of the Third androids is because of the feminist plot to genocide all sexy female androids to secure their dominance, and to increase integration between Mars and Earth. XDI\'m laying this out pretty directly, but the way everything is written is extremely vague and rushed. The themes aren\'t well-explored at all. There are a bunch of sexy female android bombings, which aren\'t integrated into anything coherently AT ALL, so I\'m assuming these were false flag attacks by the government to increase resentment against sexy female androids. Nothing in the last episode really makes sense, and it\'s not clear to me why Sybilus and Armitage take on a small army by the end. It seems completely pointless, though it also appears to be a ""confidence boost"" for all the sexy female androids who are watching the action scene on TV for whatever reason. Be empowered, you sexy female androids, before you get genocided and turned into a toaster, that is.Considering hypergamy, no-fault divorce, feminism, and various other factors, it\'s true that family formation is harder and child birth is lower, and given that the focus is on Armitage and the Third androids, and we\'re supposed to feel sympathy for sexy female androids, it appears to me that this was probably kind of meant to favor sexy female androids with wombs as a viable reproductive alternative in a sexual arms race that could compete with strong independent waman and lead to an incel revolution. Better hit the gym, fatty. ;)Konaka has had a lot of attention lately for being ""based"" and dabbling in various ""conspiracy theories,"" and he does seem to have some degree of right-wing views, so I think this is actually kind of likely, but the story is also insanely muddled and contradictory (at one point Armitage even says she can\'t feel pain, then later says she can feel pain—even the most basic of details are contradicted), so who even knows?Additionally, there is a movie version of this OVA that removes and adds scenes, and it has a shorter running time. That version might be better executed, but I haven\'t seen it. I\'m aware that one scene in particular was removed: a Neuromancer-styled bit with the main characters ""jacking in"" to a terminal and getting information from a digitized character... the only problem is that this is a waste of time and just meant for cool visuals because the only information given is stuff THE CHARACTERS ALREADY KNEW! Although it\'s kind of a cool scene, its extraneous nature is obvious. I could definitely see this production benefitting from a bit of editing and some rewrites. Most subplots are left dangling or unexplored.Honestly, this OVA was a blast, but as I\'ve been typing this out, I can\'t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all, and this is definitely style over substance and a bit of a mess, but it\'s also fascinating to see Konaka as a developing writer. story—it\'s about the visuals, the action, and the experience.The character Armitage follows the trend of female characters in other cyberpunk productions from the time—most notably Ghost in the Shell: a focus on sex appeal, skimpy clothing, and a frame so lithe you wouldn\'t expect her to be able to put up a fight against a nursing home patient, but she\'s badass enough to take on a small military! She tries her hardest to act cute and is very childish; of course, she\'s also an android, and due to the social climate, that makes her neurotic and insecure. Her background and how she ended up as a police officer is never clear, and her backstory seems to have been an afterthought.The other detective is a huge lunkhead named Sybilus, who was designed to be as big as was realistically possible to contrast with the tiny stature of Armitage. His backstory indicates his wife (???) was probably killed by an android, so he HATES THEM WITH A PASSION. This is basically explored in a 10 second dream sequence, he says stuff like ""DAMN ROBOTS, KILL THEM WITH FIRE AND TURN THEM INTO SARDINE CANS!"" and people on the force that he has only spoken with for like 5 seconds reference his backstory randomly like they\'ve known him for years. He sort of has an identity crisis as his human parts are replaced in the line of duty, and he starts to feel more robotic, and Armitage is just so cute that he wants to mate her, so any hatred he has is dissolved pronto. Eh, there could have been a lot more conflict here and more natural character drama or philosophical considerations, but he\'s not all that well-written. I don\'t find the romance all that believable, and it\'s frankly a little gaggy.In fact, none of the characters are especially well-written, but they have quite a presence, and they do a lot of scenery chewing that allows one to easily nod along to the wonderfully realized futuristic world, complete with upside-down and vast cityscapes, holograms, female androids with funny little protruding elements on their heads, Martian landscapes, and really some of the best cyberpunk imagery you\'ll see outside of Bladerunner, GITS, Akira, or a few other select titles, reinforced by pulsating synth rock; plenty of fast-paced action with good animation and enough explosions to sate Michael Bay; and even some interesting, though somewhat half-baked thematics along the way. It\'s well-paced and directed as well, so it holds up favorably compared to most OVAs of the time period.Speaking of scenery chewing, the villain D\'anclaude has one of the most over the top performances, bringing to mind the manic portrayals of the Joker from Batman (notably, Konaka also is known for doing a lot of the writing for MECHA BATMAN, AKA Big O) or some silliness like that—he always does his trademark—VERY GRATING WARLOCK-LIKE—cackle, yells one liners, and does that insane anime look where he makes one eye bigger for maximum intensity. It gets hammy as hell. He spends the whole OVA brutally murdering android women in lurid pulp fashion.We do have the typical plight of cute android girls wondering why they were created, wanting to become human, being so conflicted, you wonder why they were programmed to replicate women so well that they\'re basically all mentally ill basket cases, etc. What does it mean to be human? I mean, she\'s basically entirely the same as a human in this, they just remind us otherwise by showing an exposed metal chassis under damaged skin and SUPERHUMAN strength. There comes a certain point where the question loses all meaning, and that is the case here.On Mars, the birthrate is low, and for some reason, no one wants to immigrate to a desolate, dystopic Martian hellhole, so most of the themes are related to automation and reproduction. Humans are mad that androids are stealing their jobs, so they riot and destroy androids. It\'s hilarious how much of a background element this is, and you never see police enforcement at all. But no amount of cute android girl uwu moments are going to make me care, and I rejoiced in the wrecked, burnt-out, and twisted frames of the androids—the word for them is SCABS and home wreckers. There was an opportunity to add a balancing act with some kind of civil rights movement... but that\'s not really there, and instead there\'s something vague about ""feminism,"" which in this case pertains to human women wanting sexy female androids genocided, so I guess that\'s why there isn\'t a backlash against the riots? I don\'t know.The really odd part of the script is that there is only one female human interviewed on television indicating this message, there is the female president (who looks like an Americanized Margaret Thatcher) of the earth federation, which is part of what is leading to a Martian policy shift, complete with a Martian politician blushing about how Martian society isn\'t feminist enough and putting a hand behind his head like he\'s embarrassed in typical anime fashion; and there is Sybilus\' wife who has no dialogue. These are the only REAL women in the whole 120 minute OVA, appearing for barely even 2 minutes of screen time! All other women are androids.There\'s really no contrasting femininity to Armitage\'s synthetic charms. And that brings us to the other amusing aspect of the show. The so-called Third androids replicate humans so well that they are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing AND they can reproduce with men. The idea was just to make female sex androids for reproduction. This could be seen as a critique of feminism—women entering the work force and clamoring for equality (or female dominance), leading to a decline in family formation and birth rate. Yet... the Third android women are all pretty much feminist role models. A career woman/CEO, independent women, a butch lesbian painter, etc. ONLY ONE OF THEM IS EVEN PREGNANT, AND NONE OF THEM HAVE KIDS! Would the Third ever have even made a dent in the population issue with expanded production? Doesn\'t seem so.The story holds together well with the gumshoeing, but it\'s a mess by the second half, once all the conspiracies emerge.

It was released back than... So for sure the drawings and animations can't keep up with newer works, but for the given time it was near to stand of the art.

Cool, so it's a +.To the characters:Police Detectives seem to be kind of nostalgic, even in 2040 they are running wild with a long coat... Hm still, feels cool. Ross seems like a Latino, who lives in a bodybuilding studio, and Armitage is the counterpart: Little girl in hot pants and suspenders... Yay nice one on this too... It's important to say that Ross has lost his (female) police partner while they fought an cyborg, so he dislikes robots... Too bad Armitage is a robot herself - oh well, standard setting, but cool non the less...Conclusion:I enjoyed watching Armitage - even if I wanted to turn off in the first minutes, it seemed kind of boring, but somehow I got to watch the whole OVA... Well if you like the cyberpunk setting and don't care about the old school art, a few storyline errors, shortcuts and so on - you'll like Armitage for sure.

But it's more of a like Midnight Eye Goku by Kawajiri. One of the finest Cyberpunk Sci Fi Classics. The reason is this one will just indulge you into the world of the setting and what the artists want rather than exploratory aspects. You would be first intrigued by how they construct the show over the...time. The OVA gets more interesting after 2nd. Because until then it just shines light on our protagonist lady Armitage, so please do not think it's not that great or such because it's not extremely fleshed out the way you think. But rather enjoy how Japanese took the Bladerunner concepts to a whole another level.Art - The cel shaded work is simply flawless, a slight differences can be observed with Armitage art among the OVAs and Ross. Not any thing to point out hard but it's just a small observation that doesn't impact you in any case. Naturally the Japanese old works of this Sci Fi genre are always unique and their own take with the concepts. I love Armitage design, her get up is simply hot and she is very loving as well for her character and keeps her femininity and compassion, the design work of her costume is very cool. The robot designs are great for what they are and how the detail just pours out of these cel works always shows how superior this style of animation is. The scale of the city and how the Androids are drawn with their designated nature of their roles while Armitage and the others are pleasing to make you feel immersed.Characters & Story - Not much to write about the story revolves around the concepts of Bladerunner, I won't spoil it since it's better left to the person to discover it. Characters of Ross and Armitage are the only ones which are explored the reason is the show revolves around them there are  few bits of their past sprinkled over the OVAs so it's very subtle that explains both the polar opposite character writing. And how they are magnetic to each other is how the story progresses, that's the beauty of this show. You get to see opposites attract. It's expected but the show carries it out in an commendable way. And wow they are truly based, in the whole Earth's approach vs how Mars want to build and sustain their own. It reflects out current Politically Correct culture a bit and we can clearly draw any sort of imagination to many possibilities etc, you will understand what I'm talking once you watch the full OVAs. The main characters are simply superb in their driving seat and you will never feel strayed.Sound - The shortest aspect that I can explore but the most packing of punch, Armitage theme is simply stellar. It just hits in perfect spot even if it's not very abundant on the different tunes or tracks. But it's just enough to keep you glued to the show, the effects are well made and are timeless and adds it up the signature of the show and leave you impressed.That's pretty much about it and you will be pleased, I will say that we do not get these type of shows, unfortunately these are very bold stories and very unique ones. This is a masterpiece for those who like similar Cyberpunk Sci Fi works.As always, hope this helps you. Have a great day ! time. The OVA gets more interesting after 2nd.

Have a great day !"", ""Nostalgia Alert - I used to see the laserdiscs for Armitage at the video store way back in the day. I was intrigued because I was a teenager and the cover art featured a scantily-clad waifu. Also, I was into cyberpunk and robots and all the like. So that was in 1997 or so and I finally got around to watching all four episodes in 2022. 25 years later but I got it done.StoryThe story is pretty good actually. It's a Blade Runner type set up with a few twists and turns. I always enjoy stories about robots and people grappling with their humanity...and this is no exception.While the concept is intriguing, it's played out slowly and awkwardly. I was not a fan of the pacing. One of the problems is with the runtime. There are only four 30-minute episodes isn't much time to explore all the story has to offer.The ending was definitive and satisfying and that's always a plus.ArtThis anime is from the mid 90s and it shows. The art isn't good. The animation similarly is not great even though there are some high points during the action scenes. There were times when the character faces and body parts were far out of proportion.That said, the backgrounds were generally well done and interesting to look at. The action was pretty good too.SoundThe OP was slick and cyberpunkish. Cool stuff. The ED is a basic ballad. I watched this in Japanese and people sounded the way they look. Sound was average +1 for the OP.CharactersDecent chars. Armitage and Ross make a decent cop buddy duo. Armitage has her character evolve a bit and its nice.

There are only four eps so I can't hold that against it.It is decent sci-fi fare. I think of this as the Anime Blade Runner.

I think it should have went more into the moral and psychological questions of robots being people, or not being people, etc. Or, it should have never bothered and went all in with action and being a lot of fun. Instead we kind of miss out on having either thing in enough quantity to really matter? The movie seems to have some moments of having cool ideas but the tone changes a lot and the story is just so surface level but simultaneously wants to...be deep. That's just what I got from it.Art - Oh boy it's rough to look at this era and not wonder how on Earth this was the style at the time. I don't like hate it, but rewind 10 years or fast forward 10 years and everything just looked way better. I grew up with this era and you know sometimes it works and it's alright, like Armitage herself looks pretty alright thanks to her bangs and the visor hiding her eyes, but most of the series shows her eyes and... It's really just not my thing. That said, not all the art is bad and clearly I just clash with that style. Really not my thing, sorry. Of it's era it's not the worst offender and actually Ross and most the other characters mostly looked really good. I think they tried to stylize Armitage to look unique and stand out and it didn't quite hit the mark in a positive way.Sound - Man this might hurt the most. The music is apparently by Hiroyuki Namba who did music for space Dandy (which you should go watch by the way it's pretty great). I think that the music on it's own without context is kind of neat, a little experimental, very of it's time. However, it isn't well utilized in the anime itself. It's used in a jarring way that isn't conducive and may even be distracting toward a scene where silence or something else would have been better than the little beep boops of synths. If you pay attention too, you can hear the Space Ghost shooting his laser sound effect used a few times and that gave me a good chuckle.Character - Really uneven and frustratingly close to being pretty good. The spotlight of course is Armitage and Ross Syllabus. Minor spoiler, Armitage is a robot who wants to be accepted in a city that has grown suspicious of robots because of attacks by them. She hates their dehumanization  and how they are treated, she wishes she didn't feel emotions because they hurt her, etc. These are all very cool ideas and they are just handled so poorly by the writing. Instead of anyone trying to help her or convince her she's wrong, Ross stands there and just says her name. I wish her character just felt more believable and a lot of her problems she supposed to come to learn to deal with just feel like they're gone for convenience. Ross is so close to being a very interesting guy, I love that he blames a robot for the death of his wife, he hates robots and doesn't treat them like people, etc. He's very thoughtful and quiet and that's all well and good, but he's way too quiet and emotive to be effective as someone we can agree or feel the emotions of the story through. I don't know it just all felt so nebulous by the end and with a pretty strong start that was disappointing to me.Enjoyment - This was shorter than a lot of other OVAs I watched in on sitting, that is I 1 part of 4 per day. I found myself just pausing the video to go do whatever because it was really just un-engaging throughout. Like it wasn't bad but I won't be watching this of my own leisure any time soon. That's not to say it's never good of course, it has some decent action very rarely, and sometimes a character does emote well and I can feel something from it. Overall though, no not very enjoyable sorry.Overall - I came away from it pretty underwhelmed. It's not really bad and it's also not like really good. It has some small shining moments but for all the time they had to develop story and characters it still feels underdeveloped. It wasn't greatly offensive and I've experienced far worse time wasters, but yeah this didn't grip me all that much. So yeah, just kind of okay. be deep.

After a strong of watching really disappointing OVAs, my expectations were low. Even if my expectations were high however, I would still have enjoyed this as much. There are many positive elements to mention here so be prepare for some gushing.First off, the music and sound. Goodness me it is perfect. I am really not a fan of anime intro and outro tracks normally.  Far far far too often they are cheesy parodies of themselves. This show however is most certainly not. I watched the intro and outro of every episode. Within the show, the music...is even better. Maybe I'm a little biased in this regard. One of my favourite bands is Front Line Assembly so with me being a huge fan of early nineties techno industrial, I was already the target audience before I started watching. It's bold, it's loud, fits every scene perfectly and is utilised perfectly. I was very impressed with this shows music. Absolutely outstanding. 10/10.The story is also very fascinating. Very often with have these types of Sci-fi themes involving robots or mech and humans do not like them. It's been done many many times and will be done many many times again. This however, I believe, is one of the finest examples of this I have seen. The pacing is superb, especially with the double length first episode. It gave the show so much room to set the pace and develop the characters. It gave us the time to love the characters, be pulled into the story and by the end of ep 1, you are wondering where the heck those 40+ minutes went. By the final episode I was very apprehensive as to how it would be drawn to a close. Normally, you are taken on a wonderful journey for it to be abruptly written to a close in the last two minutes. Here, this is not the case. A very satisfying ending that leaves the story open, yet closed at the same time.Finally the animation. The show has a great pallet, it's classic nineties animation delivered exactly the way you want it to be.  I felt every frame was draw with a purpose.  The character art is great, has an excellent varied look to each individual. The world the story is told within looks stunning. A lot of time was clearly spen making sure the surrounding of the scenes was detailed and in line with where the story was taking you. The action scene animation was handled incredibly well too. Not OTT, just enough to deliver an exciting and engaging scene to guide you along the story.All in all, this is a fantastic OVA. Great animation, excellent story and brilliant music. Definitely one of the best OVAs from the nineties. Definitely watch this, you won't be disappointed. is even better. Maybe I'm a little biased in this regard. One of my favourite bands is Front Line Assembly so with me being a huge fan of early nineties techno industrial, I was already the target audience before I started watching. It's bold, it's loud, fits every scene perfectly and is utilised perfectly. I was very impressed with this shows music. Absolutely outstanding. 10/10.The story is also very fascinating. Very often with have these types of Sci-fi themes involving robots or mech and humans do not like them. It's been done many many times and will be done many many times again. This however, I believe, is one of the finest examples of this I have seen. The pacing is superb, especially with the double length first episode. It gave the show so much room to set the pace and develop the characters. It gave us the time to love the characters, be pulled into the story and by the end of ep 1, you are wondering where the heck those 40+ minutes went.

It could be normal to see this title and quickly get stuck by tags like ""cyberpunk"" ""sci-fi"" ""OVA"" etc and expect some kind of a hidden gem of the decade. Is this anime that? Well, i would say no, but it has it own worth and also some flaws, but in spite of it I think this...should be a sure must-see for every lover of the genre.Armitage III is set in a -on these days- not so far future where humans could achieved the colonization of Mars, and its urban structure and population got enough developed to the point where a nice portion of the latter consist of very humanized robots. In this setting we got the two main characters: Ross Sylibus and Naomi Armitage, an earthling cop who joins martian police department and a martian policewoman. These two, alongside the main villiain takes the most of the time in screen so other characters are just there to cover the definition of secondaries.Beyond the action, the core ot this anime lays on its own questions and those existential and moral issues these characters (and also the whole world in there) are forced to face, and it is so correctly developed that it takes the main attraction of the series.The characters, the script, the stage and the global atmosphere sourrouning the ova result on a well developed but also no so deep worldbuilding, enough to just get focused on the plot though, which fortunately is aided by a limited but great soundtrack, a nice sound mixing and cool visuals, especially during the action scenes (as you could expected from an OVA of the mid 90s). It\'s not an Akira or End of Evangelion level of technical work but it\'s far beyond than acceptable and for sure much better than anything new you could find on a random season from the last 15 years (of course there\'re exceptions, but when you reach those ~23 fps-action-scenes or those techno sounhdtracks you inmediately remember that this kind of anime is not made anymore unfortunately).As a whole Armitage III is a pretty and very interesting sci-fi show which nothing has to envy to other titles of its genre when referred to the main idea and philosphy around the plot. Such is this that it\'s inevitable to not think of GitS when it comes to the main questions the characters and the show make to themselves, or even during those fights in a small space between an android and a giant armored robot controled by someone-else. Is it something not seen before? Probably not. And is it enojyable? most surely it is. Is it worth-watching? if you like cyberpunk futuristic and philosophical sci-fi analogue-shooted anime, get the hell out of here and go watching it now. should be a sure must-see for every lover of the genre.Armitage III is set in a -on these days- not so far future where humans could achieved the colonization of Mars, and its urban structure and population got enough developed to the point where a nice portion of the latter consist of very humanized robots.

The moments between Ross & Armitage are way too short.Sure, the animation is clunky, the details might look dated, but on it's own Armitage the 3rd is really an action romance show hiding under the cyberpunk aesthetic. It definitely can't hold a candle to ghost in the shell in terms of pure visual quality, but it actually displays a bit of the casual fun present in the GiTS manga / SAC or say battle angel alita. It is one of the predecessors of the whole 2000s - 2010s series...of action animes that center around a female robot love interest (ie: sora no otoshimono, plastic memories). It is again just such a shame the little scenes we get of Armitage flirting, having fun or cracking jokes are so short. Despite all its shortcomings the show really makes it easy to adore Armitage with just how she interacts with everyone else in the show. A real 'waifu' if you will.Overall, the show is absolutely a must watch for 90s anime fans, or even 90s cartoons fans since the english dubs really fit Armitage and ross well. It's a great watch too if you enjoy abit of detective noir, romance, robot women all in one show. However, you probably won't enjoy Armitage the 3rd if your expecting something serious like GiTS. of action animes that center around a female robot love interest (ie: sora no otoshimono, plastic memories).

Like there's a reason people think all weebs are incel freaks and shit like this doesn't help lol. But, like most things, I have to give it some credit. It was animated well and the premise was so cool. Its influence on TV as a whole can't be ignored, it really did inspire a lot of people to create. It's also a staple of...the cyberpunk genre. I think it probably would have done a better storytelling job had it had a couple more episodes, because it does feel rushed. And I suppose that is the recurring problem with OVAs isn't it?

Binchou-tan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/750/Binchou-tan,"[""For those of you looking to relieve those slice-of-life blues afterAria finished, then look no further than Binchou-tan.The series began life as began as a manga by Ekusa Takahito before being adapted for anime in 2006. The story is set in the town of Minabe in the Wakayama Prefecture (located in the Kansai region), and the series pays homage to the area in a number of aspects, the most prominent being the names of the characters. The titular character, and indeed many of the other characters, are named for different types of charcoal, with Binchou-tan being named after binchotan, a form of white charcoal that...the Wakayma region is famous for producing.This connection has added to the popularity of the series throughout Japan, so much so that Binchou-tan is now the official mascot of the Kishu-Binchotan Promotion Museum, which is run by Minabegawa Forestry Society.The story is very simple. A little girl named Binchou-tan lives alone in a run-down cottage in the forest outside of town. Life is hard but she takes each day as it comes, works hard at various odd jobs, and tries not to let her spirits flag.Unusually, each episode in the series is split into two individual stories, so over the course of half an hour the viewer is shown two chapters in Binchou-tan's life. Surprisingly, this works rather well, especially as this is purely a slice of life show. Over the course of the series the viewer is given a taste of Binchou-tan's life, and whilst the general tone is very much an upbeat one, the show isn't afraid to give the old heartstrings a good hard yank (you have been warned).The artwork throughout the series is actually very good. The backgrounds and settings are extremely well done, from the rustic setting in the town, to the lush greenery of the forest. A lot of attention has gone into scenery, and because of this the area in which the show is set has a vibrancy that is rare in anime.Characters are also well done, relatively speaking of course. There is a penchant for labelling the characters in the show as &quot;lolis&quot;, however this is a gross misconception, especially given the sexual connotation attached to that word. Binchou-tan and her friends are designed very much like chibis, however there is a distinctive innocence about each of the characters which is readily apparent just from their look. Binchou-tan herself could be a postergirl for &quot;kawaii&quot;.One thing that may confuse some viewers is the log on Binchoutan's head. This is actually a piece of charcoal, although it's never really clear if this is the type of charcoal for which she is named. She is not unique in this repect either, as some of the  other characters also make reference to the charcoal industry in both name and hair adornment.The sound quality throughout the series is very good. The various effects and background noises are well used, with no effects overwhelming the audience at any time. The voice actors are also good, and manage to give each character a certain innocent quality which is reflective of their design and personality.The one element that really stands out about the show, aside from the scenery that is, is the music. I can't actually recall a single moment that was bereft of music of some sort. The various orchestral scores are very much in keeping with the tone of the series, serving to enhance the atmosphere in any given scene. In addition to this, the OP is a very melodic track which I found to be quite fitting for the show as a whole, whilst the ED is a very upbeat track about Binchou-tan herself.The characters are extremely, almost tooth-achingly, cute. This isn't just in terms of their design, but also their personalities. Each of the characters has a unique personality, and whilst there are some nods in the direction of stereotype, these are often offset in some  way (Ren-tan, for example, fits the &quot;silent girl&quot; mould, however she is also very playful, and not above a little teasing).The one thing that belies the generally cheery tone of the series is the fact that Binchou-tan herself is rather a tragic figure. She is upbeat, hard working, and more than a little shy. She is also extremely lonely, something which the show highlights in several ways. However, she has a certain air that attracts the other girls to her, and as the show progresses we see some very subtle changes in her personality.Unfortunately, the other characters don't develop as much as Binchou-tan does, however this can be forgiven because of the length of the series and the fact that each episode is enjoyable in some way.Now many people will automatically write off this series simply because of the fact that Binchou-tan is so damn cute. This, together with the colourful backgrounds, often makes people believe that this is purely a kids series. However, such thinking means you'll miss out on what is actually a very enjoyable show.The main appeal of the series is that it is almost purely slice of life. The setting and episodic format may not initially be appealing to many, however it truly is worth giving it a chance. The characters, the scenery, the various days in Binchou-tan's life, are all wonderfully realised, and whilst I may be a terminal Aria fan, I will freely admit that this series is very, very close to it in many respects.In all honesty, I would recommend this series to anyone who simply wants to watch something nice for a change. There's no romance, no real drama, no big fights, and no gondolas (there are ducks and birds however), but don't be fooled into thinking that there isn't anything for you to watch. This is an extremely enjoyable series, and the length of each episode means that, whilst you can easily finish the whole show in one sitting, you'll probably find yourself spreading the series out over the course of a few days (just to make it last longer).I now have two shows which I can truly call relaxing. the Wakayma region is famous for producing.This connection has added to the popularity of the series throughout Japan, so much so that Binchou-tan is now the official mascot of the Kishu-Binchotan Promotion Museum, which is run by Minabegawa Forestry Society.The story is very simple.

HOW CUTE!!&quot;)Enjoyment: 7 (Binchous friends definitely made the show fun)Overall: 37/50 = 7.4 (Very unique experience worth checking)...::FULL REVIEW::Binchou-tan is a true Slice of life animation based around the life of a little girl name Binchou. As her name describes she's very poor and lives in a rundown shack in the middle of the woods. But she's not alone.This story kind of starts of as a documentary of sorts and slowly introduces Binchou-tan's friends throughout the series. The story sounds very tragic and it is. From the moment she opens her bigger than life eye's, theres a 89% chance you'll instantly fall in love and pity this small girl trying to survive the day. It doesn't even bother to joke about her poor situation. At times you'll feel downright sad for the girl and want to wish her the best to survive the day. And thats what this show does really well. Pulls it's readers into this poor yet simple story of a girl living in the woods. They don't overdo it either, it's just enough for you to pity the girl but theres enough lighthearted things that she does to keep you from watching a train wreck style of story.The art is all really pretty and does it's job well for showing feelings through the background among other things. Little details like cracks and tears in binchou tans sheets or the grassy knolls of the country side are all displayed in beautiful detail. But the actual animation portion is a little of the opposite. The main characters art style is pure chibi, with the oversized head and tiny bodies. So therefore since their drawn in a simple way most of the characters and moving objects are drawn in that simple style. Its not that bad of a thing to witness, but it does take an episode or two to get used to it.The characters themselves are out of this world as well. The word cute is pretty synonymous with chibi and thats what this show prides itself in, its cute factor. From their voices, to the character style even to their clothing it screams  cute with a capital C U T E. Of course the cute factor is there to lighten the overall mood that is Binbou-tan. It is still a story about a poor girl after all. You don't even have to see the girls in action to know how cute they are. Just listen to their voices and theres a very high chance of your heart melting. All the voice actors are easily recognized and you might even spot one or two of them from other series *COUGH*FukoFromClannad*COUGH*Overall this show is a slice of life experience unlike you have seen from all those other slice of life shows. Pity her, love her, hate her, despise her, but whatever you do, you just can't keep  your eyes off little Binchou-tan. The show will really drag the viewer into her world and for better or worse will immerse you in Binchou's world. A word of caution though, this is HEAVY in the chibi loli genre. If you can't stand the voices, look, or even their facial expressions of a chibi loli keep away.As a side note: I mentioned back in my El Cazador de la Bruja review that they should make a show with just Lirio as the main character... If you watch this, Binchou-tan is pretty much a mirror image of Lirio, except Binchou can talk. ::FULL REVIEW::Binchou-tan is a true Slice of life animation based around the life of a little girl name Binchou.

I honestly wasn't expecting too much from this anime when I first came across it, but now that I've finished the last episodes I'm surprised to say that I may have found and anime worthy of knocking a title from my top ten list.But who gets the boot!? I'll have to think about that later, for now, on with the review! ♡Story 10/10The stories follow a simple slice of life narrative with the main character working through life on her own,...obtaining money for food by getting jobs from a job board in town, when she's not doing that she's playing with her friends.Watching the interactions between her and the other girls was very enjoyable and learning about the others was interesting.Though the story does take a bit of a sad turn once we start learning about Binchou's past. If I had any complaints it would be that I wish we'd learned about her past bit more before the anime ended.

Well, it's not. It's a very slow-paced slice-of-life anime with very little comedy. And it works.Binchou-tan tells the tale of Binchou-tan, a young girl who lives out in the mountains by herself as this world apparently has no social workers. She goes to town every day to work for money, because this world apparently has no child labor laws. In this town, she creates and hangs out with several other young girls.Binchou-tan is a really simple show. It's just Binchou-tan doing stuff every day....That's it, nothing more. However, in a way that's the charm of the show. Most slice-of-life anime just show selected scenes from the life of the characters, where stuff happens. Sure it's not exciting stuff, but it's still stuff. However, due to Binchou-tan's really slow pace and having several scenes of just Binchou-tan walking around, in a way you feel like you are watching Binchou-tan's whole life. It's not boring, it's actually very interesting to see how this strange little girl lives. Actually, girls. Most of the episodes switch back from scenes of just Binchou-tan and shows the life of the other girls too. Heck, one of the girls doesn't even meet up with the group for the first time face to face until the last minutes of the final episode. I really liked how they did that, as it gives us a taste of others lives and not just Binchou-tan's.The characters in Binchou-tan... I hate to admit it, but they're all rather lame. Most have little personality. Binchou-tan is just kind of, well... I don't even know. She never really talks very much during the show. She's rather kind and quiet I suppose, and a little spacey. For the rest of the girls, most of them have gimmicks, not personality. Chiku-tan likes to invent stuff. Ren-tan is a Buddhist, likes dangos, and has good luck. Kunugi-tan is rich and wants to befriend Binbou-tan. Aloe likes to swim. However, the dullness of the characters never really gets in the way of the actual show, due to the fact it doesn't concentrate on comedic scenes but just scenes of everyday life. In a way, their dullness somehow makes the show more relaxing.The animation is decent. The character designs are definitely more chibi than realistic. They're obviously are meant to look cute and add to the fluffiness of the show. They do work out in the end though. The simplistic character designs allow more fluidity in the animation, even if it does use stock footage a few times. Yes, stock footage in a slice-of-life show. Why not? The music is also rather decent. The opening is cute in a relaxing way and the ending is cute in a, well, cute way. They both fit the mood of the show. The voice acting is also decent, though I do get the feeling I would have hated Binchou-tan's voice actor if she spoke more as she has a really squeaky voice.If you must have plot and action and comedy in your anime, then stay as far away from this show as you can get. It is a must for slice-of-life fans though, and I give it an 8. That's it, nothing more. However, in a way that's the charm of the show. Most slice-of-life anime just show selected scenes from the life of the characters, where stuff happens. Sure it's not exciting stuff, but it's still stuff.

It definitely falls along the same lines as Aria and Tanaka-kun in presenting the viewer with a relaxing and sometimes comical atmosphere.Plot: 8/10This anime is the purest essence of slice of life as it can get. Bincho-tan is extremely episodic in episode layout, with only minor plot points interspersed throughout its showing. There is however a surprising depth in the plot found in the titular character Bincho-tan’s backstory. Nonetheless, this presents a relaxing atmosphere for the show and makes it very easy to watch. The very slow pacing...of the show may be a turn off to some viewers.Characters: 7/10The characters of Bincho-tan are all pretty different from one another and round out the cast well. Despite this, all of them aside from Bincho-tan are fairly one dimensional and express little to no development. As a result, they tend to dull as characters once the series continues beyond their initial  introduction. On an interesting side note, several of the characters are based on different types of charcoal, as seen by their designs.Animation: 8/10The biggest draw to Bincho-tan for me was the animation. The backgrounds are rendered absolutely beautifully. The characters are primarily drawn in a chibi style, and while they are not the best designed, they are extremely cute. The chibi characters may feel childish or just completely off putting to some.Soundtrack: 10/10The soundtrack for this anime is extremely well done, setting the relaxing mood of the show perfectly. It is primarily orchestral in composition and easy to enjoy for most viewers.Themes: 10/10Bincho-tan is primarily meant to just be an easy show to watch and enjoy, it does have some surprisingly deeper themes. While on the surface it focuses on friendship and helping one another, and does a good job at this, it also shows determination and self-sufficiency as commendable attributes. These are best highlighted in Bincho-tan herself as she goes about daily life almost completely by herself, despite her apparent young age. There are some sadder themes also hinted at, such as the general struggles and loneliness people under tough circumstances undergo, again seen in Bincho-tan.Score: 8.6/10Grade: BFor more reviews by me, check out my site: https://rishraffreviews.wordpress.com/ of the show may be a turn off to some viewers.Characters: 7/10The characters of Bincho-tan are all pretty different from one another and round out the cast well.

Baja no Studio,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35965/Baja_no_Studio,"['It is very easy to be cynical about  ""Baja no Studio"". It\'s a pretty obvious attempt from KyoAni to create some new mascots while also endearing its audience to a very idealized, twee version of the animation studio, hoping that it will lead to the audience being endeared to the actual studio as well. The main character makes cute and endearing comments about the different people in the studio, the project they are working on, and his innocent affection towards them in the cutest possible voice and the cutest possible expressions.In a way, ""Baja no Studio"" is like a trick that the people behind...it are playing on the viewer. But a trick is not successful if it is not executed well, and for the most part, ""Baja no Studio"" is a very well executed trick. A very simplistic narrative about a hamster trying to save his toy duck friend while also dealing with the studio\'s latest project coming to life is supported by great animation and designs on both the main characters and the supporting staff characters. It\'s not some kind of mind blowing revelation, but it executes its premise and purpose well in the time span it is given.

I am by no means good at reviewing, I mostly just take my reviews as more of a personal enjoyment rather than judging how well they did with their characters development, music selection, story, etc...First of all, the story seems to targeted at children. I personally didn't find it interesting but I could see children liking this show. It's one of those shows that is not very memorable. You will probably forget about after a week. (I'm already forgetting things like 12 hours...after watching this show)The art work and animation is great but not on par with what Kyoani usually produces. I gave it an 8/10 because I feel like the art work and animation still outshines some of the TV anime in recent times. It's Kyoani, what else can I say :pFor sound, I honestly didn't remember any music; I know there are music but I cannot recall what they sound like. I do know it was fitting music so really no comments on this topic. The ending music is fairly cute though.For characters, I really do like Baja, the main character. The way he/ she thinks really felt like he/ she is a newborn/ baby. Makes the character believable and real to me. The rest of the cast is not anything special though. Didn't make an impression on me through the 20-30mins.Enjoyment wise, I didn't fall asleep. So that means it was at least an average for me. I wouldn't say I enjoyed it but I wouldn't say I hated it. Just average in my opinion.Overall I gave it a 6/10 because I feel like this is has it's strong points considering it's 1 episode (20-30min), but the target audience is children and the story just isn't something I will want to watch again.

Everything, from the plot to the characters to the battles gets developed within an arc, which is about 25-30 episodes, give or take.That's where the biggest inherent problem lies with The Sealed Sword Frenzy.  What has to be done in this 25-minute OVA is start and develop a plot, introduce and develop a new villain, and have Ichigo fight and defeat said villain, something that usually takes an entire arc in...the series.As a result, the plot has to move quickly in order to get everything accomplished in 25 minutes, and as a result, plot and character development are extremely weak.  It also doesn't help that the main villain gets next to no dialogue, but at least his motives are explained.One can feel that the OVA was made on a strict budget, since the animation quality is at least 2 steps behind the anime series, and the battles extremely watered down, especially the result of Ichigo's first encounter with the villain.  The only place where I felt the animators spent time with the art was in executing the villain's special attack in the final battle.  And then the plot problem comes back.  The problem of having to devote time to explain who the villain is and what his motive is, which makes the battles extremely short and disengaging.  And since there is no plot development, the struggle between the two fighting sides isn't gritty and can barely be felt at all.What exactly is the purpose of this OVA?

The newly introduced character, Baishin, is kinda interesting although it's not too original. It reminded me multiple times of Zaraki, since he can barely feel the slashes other people do to him. He has some interesting, unexplained techniques, but his story remains somewhat in the shadows (the basics are explained but with very little details). The rest of the characters are developed just as they are in the series, except maybe...in the comical scenes, where Renji is dressed up as a &quot;cop&quot;, shooting bullets carelessly.Art is just as good as the series, with very nice fight scenes and detailed characters and surroundings.

Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33729/Chain_Chronicle__Haecceitas_no_Hikari_Part_2,[]
Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16742/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui,"['[Spoiler Warning]There is a scene in Watamote where the main character, Tomoko, experiences what she believes to be public molestation. She panics, unable to even breathe or call for help. The train suddenly stops, and the passengers begin to take their leave. Tomoko then realizes that the object pressing against her is simply a bamboo sword belonging to the girl behind her. After much public embarrassment, she finally breaks free, and moves on to yet another miserable day of her life.To say that Watamote is an uncomfortable anime would be an understatement. Every minute involves Tomoko failing at something in the most awkward way...imaginable, to the point where you can\'t help but pity the poor girl. It\'s not even amusing. It\'s just depressing.Tomoko is a high school girl that simply wants to be liked by her peers. She wants to be seen as attractive by the opposite sex. She is so lonely and socially inept that even hearing a ""goodbye"" from a classmate is seen as a massive success. Her younger brother doesn\'t care about her problems, her parents think she\'s a pathetic pervert, and her only friend (who she rarely even sees) is oblivious to Tomoko\'s blatant emotional issues. She is alone with nobody to help.Does she bring some of these problems upon herself? Maybe. Does she try too hard to be somebody that she\'s not? Definitely. But who can blame her? The only time she had anything even remotely resembling a normal life was when she was a toddler. Of course she\'s angry. Of course she\'s fed-up with her lifestyle.Unlike the source material which presents itself entirely as a gag manga, the anime teases us with signs that Tomoko might actually be changing for the better. But nothing ever does change. She squanders all her opportunities, leaving both her and the audience with a bitter sense of hopelessness. What\'s the point in enduring so many embarrassing scenes when there is no payoff at the end? Are we meant to be masochists?The humor of Watamote is akin to kicking a kitten, and worse - a kitten that you sympathize with. It\'s a punchline where there is no punchline. The goal is make us laugh at somebody in a pitiable situation, to feel happy that our lives are not quite as bad as Tomoko\'s. Is that comedy? Is that entertainment? For others, perhaps, but all it did for me was bring back awful memories and remind me of everything wrong with teenagers. Some scenes were so uncomfortable that I had to take a break or avert my eyes for a few moments. That\'s not what a comedy is supposed to do.Some of the jokes can be quite funny, though. If you\'ve ever listened to porn or something equally embarrassing on your computer, only to realize that the headphones weren\'t actually plugged in, well, Watamote will remind you of such times. The best moments are when the humor is restrained and situational. The dialogue between Tomoko and her brother is also well-written and reminiscent of most actual brother-sister relationships; I just wish that there was more of him.It\'s also very easy to relate to Tomoko\'s situation if you\'ve ever dealt with social anxiety. Sure, her feelings are blatantly exaggerated for comedic effect, but the way people act around her is very much real. Teenagers love to gossip. They love to ignore and exclude anybody that isn\'t a part of their group. Watamote hits this fact home, reminding us just how idealized high school life is in anime. It is the opposite of escapism.As for the art and animation quality, Watamote is an above-average anime. Each scene is made even more depressing by the dark, often blue-and-grey color scheme. The animation is consistent (though there isn\'t much of it) and, for once, a shut-in character does not look like a supermodel. Tomoko looks disheveled, tired, and unclean. As she should. The animators don\'t even hold back on making some scenes look utterly repulsive (including a failed experiment with make-up, and a colony of ants making their home in Tomoko\'s hair... ugh). There\'s definitely some talent here, and it shows.The sound is more of a mixed bag. Kitta Izumi does a fantastic job of voicing Tomoko\'s character, but the background music is barely noticeable and the opening is some mixture of awful screamo and generic J-Pop. It\'s a cacophony that I never wanted to sit through more than once (although I\'m sure that I\'m in the minority). At least the ending sequence sounds more in line with the tone of the series: delightfully disgusting, and cute all the same.If nothing else, Watamote should be commended for daring to be different. This is not your ordinary anime. If it was an ordinary anime, Tomoko would be male and she would have a harem in love with her for some inexplicable reason. There is none of that. Watamote wastes no time on romanticizing the high school life, and instead portrays it for what is in reality. Few anime out there have had the courage to do the same.But for all the awful, depressing things we see happen to Tomoko, what do we get for it at the end? Nothing but a sad glimpse of a girl desperately clinging to the hope that some day, she might attain a normal person\'s happiness. A dream that we all know will never be fulfilled. imaginable, to the point where you can\'t help but pity the poor girl. It\'s not even amusing. It\'s just depressing.Tomoko is a high school girl that simply wants to be liked by her peers. She wants to be seen as attractive by the opposite sex. She is so lonely and socially inept that even hearing a ""goodbye"" from a classmate is seen as a massive success. Her younger brother doesn\'t care about her problems, her parents think she\'s a pathetic pervert, and her only friend (who she rarely even sees) is oblivious to Tomoko\'s blatant emotional issues. She is alone with nobody to help.Does she bring some of these problems upon herself? Maybe. Does she try too hard to be somebody that she\'s not? Definitely. But who can blame her? The only time she had anything even remotely resembling a normal life was when she was a toddler. Of course she\'s angry. Of course she\'s fed-up with her lifestyle.Unlike the source material which presents itself entirely as a gag manga, the anime teases us with signs that Tomoko might actually be changing for the better. But nothing ever does change. She squanders all her opportunities, leaving both her and the audience with a bitter sense of hopelessness. What\'s the point in enduring so many embarrassing scenes when there is no payoff at the end? Are we meant to be masochists?The humor of Watamote is akin to kicking a kitten, and worse - a kitten that you sympathize with. It\'s a punchline where there is no punchline. The goal is make us laugh at somebody in a pitiable situation, to feel happy that our lives are not quite as bad as Tomoko\'s. Is that comedy? Is that entertainment? For others, perhaps, but all it did for me was bring back awful memories and remind me of everything wrong with teenagers. Some scenes were so uncomfortable that I had to take a break or avert my eyes for a few moments. That\'s not what a comedy is supposed to do.Some of the jokes can be quite funny, though. If you\'ve ever listened to porn or something equally embarrassing on your computer, only to realize that the headphones weren\'t actually plugged in, well, Watamote will remind you of such times. The best moments are when the humor is restrained and situational. The dialogue between Tomoko and her brother is also well-written and reminiscent of most actual brother-sister relationships; I just wish that there was more of him.It\'s also very easy to relate to Tomoko\'s situation if you\'ve ever dealt with social anxiety. Sure, her feelings are blatantly exaggerated for comedic effect, but the way people act around her is very much real. Teenagers love to gossip. They love to ignore and exclude anybody that isn\'t a part of their group. Watamote hits this fact home, reminding us just how idealized high school life is in anime.

Also, have plenty of supply of water ready. Oh and don't forget some cough medicine. Now you're probably asking yourself, “why??” The answer is simple:You're going to be laughing so damn hard in this series like you've never ever before.Watamote, aka No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys’ Fault I'm Not Popular!, is an animated series based off the manga of the same name written by Tanigawa Nico. The series chronicles the life...of an antisocial girl named Tomoko Kuroki. It depicts the every day life of this young girl as she finally becomes a high school student. The problem? She is literally an otaku with no social experience with no real friends, much less a boyfriend. Well, now that might be something that not any of us wants to be in the shoes of but for Tomoko, it's what she has to go through every single day of her life.For Tomoko, she is what represents the antithesis of a high school girl. While most girls in high school already have friends and are looking forward to the dating cycle, Tomoko is still in the baby stage of her making a real friend. (a boyfriend would obviously be better but I think that might be out of her league for now) Tomoko has always being a shy girl throughout her childhood and has a problem of getting along with others socially. In fact, her social skills are so below average that through flashbacks, we see she has only made three actual “conversations” with her peers. But hey, it's high school so the opportunity to shine is now right? WRONG. For Tomoko, it doesn't seem like much has progressed. She is still stuck as an antisocial girl with zero experience in socializing. She often has thoughts in her head too that are filled with delusions about others. For instance, she often fantasizes what it would be like if she really was popular. These delusions expands on her being the queen, majesty, or some sort of celebrity in her own mind. Other times, she pictures herself in a world of her own where she is the ruler and the subjects are those 'popular kids'. Unfortunately, she often mixes the wrong way between her fictions and reality. These usually result in consequences...mostly getting herself embarrassed or humiliated.What impresses me most about her character is that Tomoko is very relatable. In fact, most of her life situations can be traced to our own childhoods. In fact, some of you reading this might be one of those folks who were once antisocial yourself. There's a line though between being antisocial or just a nutcase. In Watamote, Tomoko takes it to the extremes through her behavior. She has a love for BL games, often gets ideas from the manga/anime she is in love with, and always seems to say or do the wrong things at the wrong time. (mostly anyways) Furthermore, Tomoko seems to have a perverted mind as well as she fantasizes about genders of both sexes. In particular, her 'friend' Yui is a target of those  perverted thoughts as she plays strange imaginations in her head.The series follows a slice of life format so don't expect any form of arc going on. What you should expect though is Tomoko's progression as she tries to climb out of her shell in terms of being the antisocial kid. She doesn't have any real friend and seems like High School isn't getting any better. In fact, her vow to become more popular is played as parodies with each of her attempts. These usually are plans played in her head that often doesn't seem to go the way she wants to. Tomoko's reliance on the knowledge she gets from anime, manga, and in the otome game world doesn't help her at all. Although it's played as a parody most of the time, there are moments where we may also feel sorry for her. Why? Perhaps it's because we might have been in the same situation before. In fact, there is probably one moment in life where you feel like you just can't succeed in something no matter how hard you try. In the end, you realize it might all be pointless. For Tomoko Kuroki, it's something she has dealt with many times in her life. “What's the point?”Tomoko's relation with her family is surprisingly quite realistic; at least at first glance. She has caring parents whom often cares for her daughter despite them not knowing of her way of life. Tomoko's younger brother Tomoki Kuroki is also portrayed as being just what a younger brother might be like in the real world – impatient, reserved, and often brutally honest. Throughout the series, we clearly see that the two of them behaves like siblings because of the way the argue. Some of these are based off of normal norms while other times are related to almost no reason. Regardless, it's realistic in my point of view because siblings always gets into fights no matter what. In fact, if you had a sibling, wasn't there at least one time where the two of you disagreed over something? (even if it's completely pointless?)On the other hand, we later meet another character who served as an 'old friend' of Tomoko. Unlike Tomoko though, she significantly changed not only physically but also in terms of her personality. She represents what Tomoko is not – pretty, cheerful, and sociable. It's sad to see Tomoko being compared to such a person throughout the series because the gap in their differences. Furthermore, she seems to have accomplished a goal in her life that has been an obstacle that Tomoko tried to overcome all this time. Sometimes, you just have to feel sorry for her.The idea and originality of Watamote isn't as fresh as some people might think though. Recent series such as My Romantic Comedy SNAFU also depicts a young boy with delusions and being antisoical while being acquittance with a beauty. Other series such as Welcome to the NHK and The World God Only Knows also depicts the otaku culture with an antisocial character and being unpopular with their peers. The highlight to Watamote though is that Tomoko is an extreme case but also struggles to overcome her obstacles in a more humorous way. The way Tomoko is portrayed often shows that she is stuck in a labyrinth of her own problems. There seems to be no way out for her because of various reasons. These reasons are often humorous but if we take them to the real life world, it can be a serious problem. Regardless, I find Watamote and its portrayal of Tomoko's character to be very entertaining to watch.The comedy of the series are also the highlights. There are references being made to pop culture as well as other popular anime/manga series. Sometimes though, I feel like the show is trying a bit hard or more repetitive than it should be. Tomoko's quest to become more popular in high school might also frustrate viewers especially those who wants her to succeed. Then finally, Watamote might also be a painful watch especially for those who has truly been in Tomoko's shoes before. It makes some of us look back and tell ourselves, “wow, I think I've been there before..just look at me now”.Watamote's artwork overall is painted with a simple style. Tomoko's character is probably the most noticeable. The way she looks isn't what some people might call 'attractive'. Rather, she is designed in the way an antisocial kid might be like. Her long hair, bagged eyes, and way she dresses shows that she isn't the typical valley girl. In fact, she doesn't use makeup or spent hours doing her hair in the morning. Silver Link adapts the manga well for the visuals just the way it ought to be – straight forward and simple.As for soundtrack goes, Watamote's OP song, Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui by Konomi Suzuki n' Kiba of Akiba is extremely noticeable with its combination of rock and metal cords. Along with the strange appeal to her character, the song depicts Tomoko as a kid who doesn't fit with the popular crowds. The OST of the show is pleasant and often times plays noticeable tones of its soundtrack during certain scenes. These usually include moments when Tomoko gets caught up in awkward moments. The ED contains several different styles but all of them are portrayed as humorous and awkward. Finally, I would like to give praise to Tomoko's VA Kitta Izumi for her role in this series. Her voice as Tomoko truly shows that she is antisocial girl with no social skills and troubling delusions.Ultimately, this show is one hell of a fun ride. I forgot the amount of times I had to screenshot those hilarious moments involving Tomoko. It brings about the humor of what an antisocial girl might be like in the case of Tomoko. Although the series does take it a bit to the extreme at times, I find it funny to watch because it pokes fun at the idea. In fact, the idea of being antisocial is often portrayed as a serious consequence. And indeed it is but in Watamote, the show gives off more of a humorous experience in the eyes and shoes of Tomoko. It's not a good thing to be antisocial or delusional but this show portrays it in such a way that you can't sometimes help but laugh. (at least I did) I hope you get a good laugh from this series as well. High school experiences might not be something we all enjoyed in our lives but it's certainly an important part of our memories.

For Tomoko, that might not be appealing but this series sure was."", 'WATAMOTE -No matter how I look at it, It\'s you guys fault I\'m not popular- is a comedy aimed straight at dysfunctional geeks, or former dysfunctional geeks, who can laugh at their own faults and take them with a grain of salt. Its gallows humor centers around a socially inept mess of a protagonist who goes through life repeating the cycle of self-embarrassment and loneliness while learning nothing from it, and garnished with anime and pop culture references and parodies. It\'s a show that hits painfully close to home for anyone who has social anxieties, yet playful enough that it remains morbidly funny rather than...becoming straight-up depressing, most of the time at least. It\'s also pretty blunt about who\'s really at fault for all the main character\'s problems.Our social misfit of a protagonist is Tomoko, an unkempt antisocial teenager entering her first year of high school. Despite having difficulty with talking to the opposite sex and having hardly any friends in middle school, Tomoko convinces herself that she will become instantly popular after her high school debut. It goes without saying that this isn\'t the case. Instead, she ends up brooding, having odd fantasies, and lamenting the fact she isn\'t popular. She spends her days fading into the scenery and going unnoticed by her fellow students, except for her occasional bouts of awkwardness; her days off school are usually spent cooped up in her room. Still, she\'s determined to gain popularity among her peers, even if she has absolutely no clue how to go about accomplishing that goal. Cringe inducing awkwardness and hilarity ensue.Majority of the show\'s humor comes from Tomoko\'s breathtaking ineptness. Not only does she have trouble talking to people, she has no sense of how to handle social situations at all. On top of that, she\'s also pessimistic and has a really dirty mind. Consequently, she constantly misinterprets even the simplest of interactions and blows them out of proportion; sometimes putting a sexual twist on them. A single kind gesture from a boy sends her into hilariously ludicrous fantasies of that boy having having a crush on her and becoming her boyfriend, even if there isn\'t a single indignation that he is actually interested in her. She comes up with half-baked ideas how to get noticed by her classmates which either go unnoticed or cause her embarrassment, even as she has overblown daydreams of becoming the most popular girl in class. She even botches an attempt to impress her visiting younger cousin, who had actually admired Tomoko until this particular visit. It would be depressing (actually, it still sort of is) if it wasn\'t for how clearly deluded Tomoko is (she takes social ques from anime), and the show\'s unhinged presentation of her delusional fantasies and social ineptitude.The irony in this is, despite coming up with harebrained ideas to get her classmates\' attentions, Tomoko rarely tries to interact with them normally. Instead of actually attempting to get acquainted with her fellow students, she just mopes around and daydreams about having friends. Of course, this is partly due to shyness, but Tomoko actively avoids interacting with people. She\'s also jealous, and even a bit spiteful, towards people more popular than her. Tomoko\'s loneliness is something she brings upon herself, if even just partly. Of course, she\'s unaware of this; propelling the show\'s morbid laughs as she runs around in circles.Now, you may have noticed Tomoko is the only character I\'ve mentioned so far. This is because she is very much the essence of the show; she is horribly pathetic and self-centered and incredibly counter-productive, yet somehow surprisingly sympathetic. Her desire to become popular, warped as it is, comes from a genuine place. Beneath her unkempt appearance and unsocial demeanor, she\'s a confused teenager looking for someone to connect with. As funny as her misfortunes can be, and they can be pretty damn hilarious, there\'s an underline melancholy to them. This resonate strong for anyone who has had crippling social anxieties like Tomoko. What makes WATAMOTE a breath of fresh air is that it is able to spin these negative feelings into something fun to watch. The show\'s manic energy and countless silly references to other anime (K-ON, Fist of the North Star, and Another just to name a few), which usually take form in Tomoko\'s delusions, keep the humor from being overwhelmingly bleak... most of the time, at least.The other characters in the show have significantly less attention, which isn\'t surprising given the nature of the show, but add extra flavor to the show as they interact with Tomoko. In complete opposition to Tomoko\'s high school experience, her best friend from middle school Yuu (her only friend, really) has made a full transformation from quiet shy girl to a trendy, fashionable girl. Unlike our protagonist, she\'s friendly and sociable and actually pretty sweet; even with her new found popularity she makes time for her unsociable middle-school friend whenever she can. It\'s rather funny to see the striking contrast of the separate paths the two took after middle school. There\'s also Tomoko\'s younger brother, who always seems to be at the butt of Tomoko\'s shenanigans at home. Their vague animosity towards each other mirrors that of an actual sibling relationship, something that is oddly rare in anime. Late in the series, there\'s also a character that gives Tomoko a much needed hug.Director Shin Oonuma has a very busy visual style, constantly throwing colorful and weird imagery into scenes; a habit that has been unnecessary in some of his previous works. This fits WATAMOTE like a glove, however. Tomoko has a very skewed outlook on life and an equally as overactive imagination; Oonuma\'s manic direction does wonders to illustrate this. Sometimes this comes in little touches like many of the characters having minimal detail in their designs, or Tomoko slowly becoming transparent and fading into the background. Other times it takes form in delirious spectacles, such as any of Tomoko\'s ludicrous fantasies. Also adding the unhinged visual design is the oddly angled lighting and color schemes and visual windows into Tomoko\'s thoughts. Tomoko\'s character design itself is cute in a dirty abandoned puppy kind of way; giving her some major icon power. You get the feeling that she would look pretty good if she actually took care of herself.The music is on the zany side. It\'s reminiscent the usual light music used in high school comedy anime, but with a distinct oddness to it that works well with the visual design. The real attention catcher, however, are the show\'s opening and ending themes. The show has several different ending themes; all of which are both fun to listen to, and a little crazy. The main ending theme is preformed by Tomoko\'s seiyuu, Izumi Kitta (who does an incredibly job in the role), and fits the character perfectly. The opening theme is a blast of hard-rocking energy that is accompanied by visuals that encapsulate the show\'s themes and change slightly as the show continues. It is easily one of the best anime openers in recent memory.WATAMOTE doesn\'t live to the likes of Welcome to the NHK or The Tatami Galaxy, which feature similarly dissatisfied protagonists, because Tomoko ultimately doesn\'t grow or develop much at all by the end. The show itself says that ""her story doesn\'t really matter"". However, perhaps because of this irreverence, the show is gigantically entertaining. While social anxieties are certainly a serious issue, there is something refreshing about having a show that centers around them not take itself seriously. The show isn\'t trivializing such anxieties or even making fun of them. It\'s simply inviting the viewers to laugh them off. becoming straight-up depressing, most of the time at least. It\'s also pretty blunt about who\'s really at fault for all the main character\'s problems.Our social misfit of a protagonist is Tomoko, an unkempt antisocial teenager entering her first year of high school.

As funny as her misfortunes can be, and they can be pretty damn hilarious, there\'s an underline melancholy to them. This resonate strong for anyone who has had crippling social anxieties like Tomoko. What makes WATAMOTE a breath of fresh air is that it is able to spin these negative feelings into something fun to watch. The show\'s manic energy and countless silly references to other anime (K-ON, Fist of the North Star, and Another just to name a few), which usually take form in Tomoko\'s delusions, keep the humor from being overwhelmingly bleak... most of the time, at least.The other characters in the show have significantly less attention, which isn\'t surprising given the nature of the show, but add extra flavor to the show as they interact with Tomoko. In complete opposition to Tomoko\'s high school experience, her best friend from middle school Yuu (her only friend, really) has made a full transformation from quiet shy girl to a trendy, fashionable girl. Unlike our protagonist, she\'s friendly and sociable and actually pretty sweet; even with her new found popularity she makes time for her unsociable middle-school friend whenever she can. It\'s rather funny to see the striking contrast of the separate paths the two took after middle school. There\'s also Tomoko\'s younger brother, who always seems to be at the butt of Tomoko\'s shenanigans at home. Their vague animosity towards each other mirrors that of an actual sibling relationship, something that is oddly rare in anime. Late in the series, there\'s also a character that gives Tomoko a much needed hug.Director Shin Oonuma has a very busy visual style, constantly throwing colorful and weird imagery into scenes; a habit that has been unnecessary in some of his previous works. This fits WATAMOTE like a glove, however. Tomoko has a very skewed outlook on life and an equally as overactive imagination; Oonuma\'s manic direction does wonders to illustrate this. Sometimes this comes in little touches like many of the characters having minimal detail in their designs, or Tomoko slowly becoming transparent and fading into the background. Other times it takes form in delirious spectacles, such as any of Tomoko\'s ludicrous fantasies. Also adding the unhinged visual design is the oddly angled lighting and color schemes and visual windows into Tomoko\'s thoughts. Tomoko\'s character design itself is cute in a dirty abandoned puppy kind of way; giving her some major icon power. You get the feeling that she would look pretty good if she actually took care of herself.The music is on the zany side. It\'s reminiscent the usual light music used in high school comedy anime, but with a distinct oddness to it that works well with the visual design. The real attention catcher, however, are the show\'s opening and ending themes. The show has several different ending themes; all of which are both fun to listen to, and a little crazy. The main ending theme is preformed by Tomoko\'s seiyuu, Izumi Kitta (who does an incredibly job in the role), and fits the character perfectly. The opening theme is a blast of hard-rocking energy that is accompanied by visuals that encapsulate the show\'s themes and change slightly as the show continues. It is easily one of the best anime openers in recent memory.WATAMOTE doesn\'t live to the likes of Welcome to the NHK or The Tatami Galaxy, which feature similarly dissatisfied protagonists, because Tomoko ultimately doesn\'t grow or develop much at all by the end. The show itself says that ""her story doesn\'t really matter"". However, perhaps because of this irreverence, the show is gigantically entertaining. While social anxieties are certainly a serious issue, there is something refreshing about having a show that centers around them not take itself seriously. The show isn\'t trivializing such anxieties or even making fun of them. It\'s simply inviting the viewers to laugh them off.', ""What happened? Watamote was a series about this socially retarded girl who came across with some social situations and acted retarded. Then what happened? This same thing over and over. Social situation, then retardation. This happened few times, then few times again and in the end few times happened few times too many, and that is what happened.Main points where this anime fails are pacing, character development and plot. 1-cour series can achieve a lot, but Watamote didn't even try to get anywhere. Many criticize Slice of Life series for being pointless, even state that Slice of Life is meant to be pointless, but...in Watamote's case, it's mainly just waste of potential. Watamote had the key elements to be the NHK with OreImo funfun, but someone thought it would be cool to start repeating the same stone age joke till nausea, and it sure was. (Stone age and nausea, not funfun).The characters are meeting my picture of laziness. Kuroko is pathetic, a no-life loser and more importantly, a characters which is easy to develop in whatever direction. ... NOPE. Let's have a character who is the same person always, and an annoying one too! This formula works in fighting tournament shonen, but not here. Never here. Her brother reminds me of an alpaca. Always that stupid fucking face. By alpaca I mean that one guy from Twilight. There is other character too, but they won't matter, except that one senpai girl from the last episodes. She is interesting, why won't they make an anime about her instead of this little fucker?When it comes to the animation and art, Watamote does a good job not being like all the other recent school series, so it passes. If we ignore the glorious op, the music is forgettable. Same thing with voice acting when ignoring her (you know, her) squeaking voices. Nothing impressive nor disappointing in the production, just the typical neutral nothing. in Watamote's case, it's mainly just waste of potential.

I find it hard coming from my perspective to be able to objectively rate the show overall. This is because I believe that whether you like or dislike this show heavily depends on how much you can relate to the main character, therefore your mileage my vary.**The impressions I give do contain some minor spoilers however I do not believe they effect your enjoyment of the show**The reason I really like Watamote is because it takes a particularly dark and depressing condition and gives it a light-hearted twist. See many people...seem to misinterpret Tomoko (the MC) as being introverted, however I have to respectfully disagree. Being introverted does not mean that one is socially inept, as Tomoko is. Instead it means that the introverted person in question is energized by doing things by themselves but are quickly tired when participating in things involving a group. While it can be somewhat true that those who prefer to spend time by themselves are not as socially able as extroverts, it is not the 'default' for an introvert to be bad at conversations or unable to recognize social ques.As someone who has experience with social anxiety in the past I can tell you that Tomoko most certainly suffers from social anxiety herself based on her actions throughout the series. Indeed her main goal through the show is to have lots of friends and be the interest of all the boys. If she was truly an introvert this would be in conflict with the idea that she wants to be the center of attention and be at the social peak of the high school she goes to. I feel like this needed to be explained because some dislike towards this show comes from people perceiving her as being an introvert and then subsequently stating that her behavior is unrealistic and exaggerated because 'introverts aren't like that'. Your enjoyment of the show will be enhanced if you can recognize that she has social anxiety, she is not introverted.With that in mind I want to say just how accurately the show depicts social anxiety at it's worst. Tomoko frequently struggles to even say 'Hello' or 'Goodbye' to any of the characters in the show despite them actually being more than willing to interact with her. This really is an accurate representation in my opinion. For someone with social anxiety just saying things as simple as hello and good morning are monumental tasks. Since I can relate to this it is one of the main reasons that Watamote resonates so much with me. See Watamote takes this experience and others like it and utilizes the animation and sound to make it comedic, so that I can sit back and watch this show and laugh at all the unfortunate things that happen to Tomoko. It makes it so I can laugh at my own experiences and that really is relieving. It's nice to see such a condition portrayed in anime and not instantly be depressed by it which is a challenging thing for an anime to achieve and it adds a whole new level of appreciation for me towards Watamote and what it does. On one hand it gives an oddly realistic and mature look into the life of someone with social anxiety while simultaneously parodying it, which is fantastic.In addition to this I really loved the fact that Watamote did not show Tomoko overcoming her social anxiety. One major criticism held against the show is that it does not have an overarching plot and the status quo that is set in episode 1 is still there by episode 12. While a series being too episodic is a valid complaint with many anime shows in recent years, I feel that Watamote is one of those anime that actually really benefits from being episodic. See social anxiety is not something that can simply be overcome in the period of a school term, shyness maybe, but social anxiety no. I feel like if Watamote had shown serious progression or even Tomoko outright beating her condition then it would have been unrealistic and immersion breaking. So for that I commend Watamote for not going down the idealistic route and instead sticking with the 'status quo' it portrays of Tomokos life. It really adds to my enjoyment of the show on the whole.Like I mentioned earlier your enjoyment of this show may heavily depend on how much you can relate to the experiences of Tomoko. If you can, then I highly recommend this show for you. If you can't, then you may still like it for its charming animation, good use of sound and quality 'cringe' humor. Equally however you may dislike watching a show that is basically about someone who can never do things right and is constantly messing up because of her warped view on events surrounding her. It's certainly not the best anime out there nor my favorite but to me it really had an emotional impact unlike any other anime I've watched making it worth noting for any anime fan. seem to misinterpret Tomoko (the MC) as being introverted, however I have to respectfully disagree.

Coming from someone who was in similar positions with Tomoko; its depiction of social reclusion and anxiety was perfect.  Even with a blatantly cheap budget, the series is able to vividly and impeccably flesh out Tomoko’s character. Props to director Shin Oonuma as she makes the best out of her limited budget to use creative, well-directed visual tricks, that aren’t simply used for show, but to further our understanding on Tomoko.Another great factor about this series is that when it comes to depicting Tomoko, it takes us into her life without trying to conform...the viewer to a certain mindset. All the humor that stemmed from Tomoko’s situations were funny, but in a cringe-worthily pragmatic manner rather than in a form of mean-spiritedness. And all those serious scenes of Tomoko were just to reflect on the quiet and heartbreaking moments of her instead of simply trying to force the viewers to sympathize with Tomoko.Contrary to what many people claim, you don’t have to have to relate with the female lead to enjoy Watamote. Yeah, it has its clever references to certain anime that casual viewers of anime won’t get, but overall Watamote presents itself in a manner that anyone can enjoy.Because of this, I was thoroughly impressed with Watamote at the start. The problem, as the series progresses, is that Tomoko’s charm began to fade. I understand that the message the series conveys isn’t about overcoming social anxiety, but how for many, it’s a serious issue that may never be overcome. And though I like that message, it doesn’t translate well into something I want to see for 12 episodes. Watching Tomoko monologue about her everyday life, even with all the novel and different situations she gets herself into, became stale. Even if I could still relate to Tomoko, it just wasn’t of interest to keep watching and it didn’t help that there was no firm direction or hint of what the series wanted to achieve in the end,Luckily, Tomoko isn’t the lone character in the whole series, there are side characters like her only friend Yuu, her brother and a couple of other characters that make an occasional appearance. Yes, whether it’s Tomoko trying to mirror what’s popular or bickering with her older brother, Watamote is at its best with those moments and not when Tomoko’s alone in her room. Because quite frankly, the show started feeling oddly empty and that didn’t rub me the right way.Final Verdict:Story – Non-existent, it’s episodic story-telling didn’t work for me and there’s no set direction of where it exactly wants to goCharacters – Tomoko is a fantastically depicted recluse, but her development is quite static. Side characters are great and bring out the best of the series, but lack more show timeSetting – Its themes of recluse and social anxiety are well presented, but don’t translate well into a vastly entertaining seriesProduction Values – Cheap, but is well made use of with incredibly creative and well-directed visual tricksDo I Recommend?:  Overall, I enjoyed Watamote for how it depicted a social recluse and I certainly enjoyed Tomoko’s interactions with the real world, but in the end - with static development, scenes of monologue that felt empty and no real sense of direction - it was just another episodic comedy that didn’t leave much of an impact on me. I commend the series for being open to viewers whether or not they relate to Tomoko’s problems, but it’s a very black and white series for the ones that do.

Everyone talked about Watamote. It was Watamote here, Watamote there. Everybody loved this anime. And I\'m still wondering why.The art is good, the animation is OK, the sound department is decent. The characters were well written and, even that I don\'t relate to her, Tomoko deserved to be a highlight.But the story is what kills Watamote. Nothing happens during the series. I didn\'t expect a killing like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. I didn\'t even want she to become popular, what would make the name senseless. But...I expected something to happen. Episode after episode, she tries to change her reality, but fails. She tries and fails. She tries and fails. She tries and fails. 12 episodes of failure after failure. If you watched the first episode, you watched the whole series.If Watamote was an OVA, I would accept it better. But a TV series? It\'s almost unbearable.And ""Oh, you didn\'t understand the concept of the series/the character"" is not a good excuse. I expected something to happen.

Just as I kept watching it, I couldn\'t stop wondering how much it would\'ve took to reach the end. This anime has often been described to me as ""realistic"", ""relatable"" and ""funny"", and as a fool, I believed that it would\'ve actually been a fun trip. It is even labelled as ""Comedy"" on almost every website.The show itself is nothing but a lonley and geeky high-school girl ( Her name is Tomoko ) and her struggle to integrate herself into the society and make friends. At first, seems...relatable towards the ones who have or had the same problems, but it truly isn\'t. The title itself says ""No matter how I look at it, it\'s your guys\' fault if I\'m not popular"", but it is actually Tomoko\'s own fault for being so bad, and isolated. Now, you\'d expect such a character to be not cold nor hot, to have her issues but a positive side, something that we can say about her that would not be as we think... Instead, she\'s straight up rude, awkward and disrespectful, either with people she doesn\'t know or her own family.The story is just filled with sadness, all over it. Not a happy, or even NORMAL moment. For those who praise this anime for being ""realistic"" clearly didn\'t think this through, as the show is filled with clichés and silliness. As an outcast and anti-social person, I can describe Tomoko\'s experiences past and present as totally unrealistic and odd. Like the fact that in an entire week of school, she had not shared a word with ANYONE exept a barely said ""Goodbye"" to her teacher. Which she took like a win to the lottery, by the way.There are also dozens of references to other anime, that are nowhere near subtle, as the only thing that stops from saying their respective name is a censorship *""beep""* in the dialogue.

The music can hardly be noticed, and barely adds any impact to any scene. Which is a shame, since the opening is absolutely awesome, and despite the ED isn\'t one of the best, it is very creative.The voice acting is well done, but when 80% of the dialogue are just inner thoughts coming from the main character, you can barely notice it.Overall, no character, nor story development whatsoever.

On the surface, the Watamote series follows the everyday life of our fellow heroine Tomoko Kuroki as she tries her hardest to become popular with her new high school life. With it, we are presented with everyday situations and how Tomoko deals with these events.Many factors such as the art and sound help to present these events in a comedic tone. You\'ll come across many references from anime today and a couple years...back, and these references serve to emphasize on the theme of being unpopular. In addition, the soundtrack is filled with fun and high-spirited tunes that don\'t take it self too seriously and presents the mood that Tomoko is currently in. Not only that, but there are surprises to see within this soundtrack which I best should not mention. Furthermore, Kitta, Izumi really shines in her role as Tomoko, she is able to portray a voice that sounds crazy yet desperate but when it comes time for Tomoko to socialize with other characters, Izumi really stands out with her awkwardness.As you watch this show, many of you will come to realize just how much Tomoko is like us. When I finished watching, I was left asking ""Did they make an anime based on my life?""; the show\'s sense of humor could hit hard at home for many, which would either leave many cringing or leave you laughing at just how much you could relate to it. Tomoko is a dimensional character because of this, you\'ll feel her pain when things don\'t go her way or be happy when something good actually happens for her, and some of you may even despise her for the way she acts. But in general, without Tomoko, this show just wouldn\'t be the same at all. As for the supporting cast, they all fit into the story of Watamote without them feeling out of place. A notable character to highlight would have to Tomoki, he is like the opposite of Tomoko and when those two are together, the situations could get very funny or very painful.At the heart, this show shouldn\'t be taken seriously, although many of us have experienced or still are experiencing the type of life that Tomoko has, it is meant to be taken in a humorous fashion, which could put off many. But if you\'re willing to look past that, then I assure you that Watamote is worth the watch, not every day would you be able to find a show as popular as this, no pun intended. back, and these references serve to emphasize on the theme of being unpopular.

Watch with contentment....If you answered yes to all of these questions, though, slap on some naked butler porn and start whacking with toothpaste at the prologue of Episode 1—this anime was made specifically for you.(Psst. I answered yes to all of them.)“Watashi ga mottenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga warui,”—or from hereforth Watamote—would be equally as titled as “The Autobiography of the Narcissistic, Melancholic Otaku.” It outlines the boring, waste-of-food lifestyle of an introverted, 21st century teenager, Kuroki Tomoko, and her misadventures in becoming a sociable person. With the lewd objective of capturing the hearts and souls of her peers, with each episode she draws forth a depressing, yet outlandishly hilarious conclusion.The plot in this anime is episodic, outlining the seasons of the school year more definitely as the series progresses. Tomoko struggles with communication, and all but too often winds up doing something socially awkward or unacceptable at little expense of notice to her colleagues. The series gradually draws towards more embarrassing or heartbreaking consequences, all-in-all while Tomoko remains spirited through to the narrow conclusion.  I strongly feel that the story itself is the weakest part and precisely why the series faces much scrutiny; the balance of the plotline heavily relies on a character that is distrusted by the audience, and rapidly grows repetitive with the endless frustration.  I think the series would have benefitted more with another arc, possibly more focused on the character changes that slowly developed as Tomoko’s continued failures amassed.Which in regards to the characters, this series shines. Tomoko is undoubtedly a relatable character to a part of all of us—wherein we seek to blame others for our weaknesses, try to change too quickly, and excuse our dark thoughts with solidarity in loneliness. In my lifetime I cannot stress enough how often I’ve thought along similar lines as Tomoko about my peers, only to realize in the end just how catastrophic that was to my personality. The consistent negativity and judgmental thoughts that she exudes are enough to make anyone feel sorry for her, if not additionally hate her.Yet, brilliantly, she emblazons the series as the protagonist (or dare I say “anti-hero”.) We watch her struggle to an end to become a happier person, sometimes even feeling proud that she has sought out meaningful changes. Also, considering her level of social anxiety it is fascinating watching her persist and continue to look brightly toward the future. After all we might choose to hate her, but are forced to love her.Laughing the entire time.Tomoki, her brother, is another catch. Though he remains secondary and purely comical, he provides the audience a chance to see Tomoko act as herself. His shrewd responses and sarcasm add just the right amount of flavor. Though many disagree with me, I feel that this was enough to keep the focus on Tomoko alone, preventing her from being trapped in the inner monologue.Izumi Kitta, did an astronomical job voicing for Tomoko. Being a good seiyuu is something expected out of Japan, but her mastery of inner monologue and conflict gave the series a bigger kick than had it been a higher-pitched tsundere. Voicing in a darker, messier timbre than a typical shoujo, Kitta employed the role with the right snappiness and vulgarity expected from a person like Tomoko. Also, her emphasis on certain words and sounds in Japanese (for those of you who don’t speak Japanese just call me a name  and skip this part),  especially puns and sexual innuendos are outstanding. The general grit of her tone alone kept the series best in the balance.The opening ranks high on my top 10 favorites. I am a classical musician and absolutely hate scream, yet I am enamoured with this opening.  The 1 minute and 30 seconds of clashing drum sets, vein-popping growls, and echoing female vocals are accompanied by a vignette of Tomoko’s personal struggle. There is a great deal of innuendo of sexual repression and symbolism that is profound to this series. I strongly recommend to everyone to not skip the introduction when watching this series, as it will constantly refresh you about the deepest meaning of the series itself.  The background music is perfect, too. It actually is quite unnoticeable, maybe perhaps for a few weird, sexualized beats, elevator music or accordions. For a series of this nature I think stronger BGMs would make the subject too lighthearted, which defeats the purpose of Tomoko’s character study.Artwork in Watamote is bewildering.  The splash of light effect and heavy detail on the eyes deceives us to believe that the series is meant to be cute. It, of course, does have many cute moments, but the choice of ambiguously dark colors or animation methods (such as crayon during imaginary scenes) retains the moody quite well.  There is a great amount of detail on the passage of time, as we see emphasis on Tomoko’s moods reflect the time of the day.Again, if you’re afraid of seeing disgusting or repulsive behavior from your protagonist, then go watch cheap, direct-to-video Christmas films. Watamote thrives on less perfect minds and hearts, engaging them as It does Tomoko about her issues and choices.And again, make sure your naked butlers are well…nevermind. If you answered yes to all of these questions, though, slap on some naked butler porn and start whacking with toothpaste at the prologue of Episode 1—this anime was made specifically for you.(Psst. I answered yes to all of them.)“Watashi ga mottenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga warui,”—or from hereforth Watamote—would be equally as titled as “The Autobiography of the Narcissistic, Melancholic Otaku.” It outlines the boring, waste-of-food lifestyle of an introverted, 21st century teenager, Kuroki Tomoko, and her misadventures in becoming a sociable person.

Are you or did you used to be that lonely person? Or do you pity those type of people and tend to ignore them?Watamote is designed to give the viewer a taste of the daily life of such a person with an excellent mixture of reality and comedy. Prepare to enter the world of an introverted, socially inept girl named Tomoko, who desperately wishes to become popular and get a boyfriend. Depending on the person, Watamote can appear depressing, funny, or ridiculous. It may be difficult to laugh...at someone else’s misfortunes and embarrassment regardless of whether or not it is fictionalized. However, it can draw several emotions for those who can relate. It gives you an opportunity to laugh at your own faults or sympathize with the character as she experiences loneliness and launch laughable schemes to get noticed.Story (9) / Character (9)Tomoko is an Otaku who spends most of her time in the fantasy world. She visualizes her life being as glamorous as in her virtual dating games or favorite anime. However, she learns that popularity is not so easy to gain in high school. She survived middle school with one geeky best friend, but she must start from scratch as she attends school with complete strangers.The reality and comedy is executed excellently as the anime follows Tomoko’s daily life in social isolation. Her awkwardness and nervousness is what brings forth the comedy, because her attempts at popularity are kind of weird and hilarious. Tomoko tries to become more feminine and attractive to boys by changing her appearance, copying actions from anime protagonists, etc. Some scenes were exaggerated to create laughter. Tomoko’s sudden reactions to certain occurrences, including being approached by a hot guy, are honest and comical.As a person who suffers from social anxiety disorder, Tomoko struggles to talk to strangers. Whether it is a simple hello/goodbye or ordering fast food, she speaks softly and stutters as if it’s a pain. She shies away from several opportunities that could gain her a friend or improve her social skills. One part of the comedy comes from Tomoko bugging Tomoki (her popular soccer brother) to converse with her until she gets a boyfriend. The conversations are amusing with the weird subjects (e.g. Tomoko asking if he gets quickies from his female coach) and Tomoki showing his annoyance and disgust.Tomoko’s inner monologues greatly expresses her character. They involve honest feelings from cursing the happy people of the world or inspiring herself to try harder to socialize the next day. Tomoko’s view of the world is that of a sim dating game or anime, causing her to have strange and inaccurate assumptions about the real world. Her time in the virtual world causes her to have perverted thoughts of what it’s like to have a boyfriend. There are two or three ecchi scenes as Tomoko does both inner and outer research on how to become more feminine.Tomoko slightly improves socially towards the end, receiving a little recognition from schoolmates. The ending is hopeful but disappointing for those who will expect immediate progress. It is yet another anime that urges you to continue the story with the manga because of its incomplete ending.Character development goes at a steady pace for a shut-in like Tomoko, which is the reason for the incomplete ending. A faster pace would make the story unrealistic, since popularity cannot happen overnight. Supporting characters give a great contribution to Tomoko’s development as she tries to gain self-confidence and hope for the future. Although the series strictly follows Tomoko, it goes inside the head of other characters and tells their thoughts of Tomoko. Some quotes from them are either funny or sympathetic.Animation (8) / Sound (8)The animation and sound are both memorable, underlining the anime’s moody atmosphere. The animation is highly responsible for bringing out the comedy by creating an over-exaggeration of awkward scenes. Visuals portrays Tomoko’s hallucinations and embarrassment with vivid colors, and her facial expressions constantly distorts to match her emotions.Character design was distinctly good. Tomoko is drawn exactly like an unappealing emo character with dark circles under eyes, long black hair, and plain clothes. Other characters’ appearances are suitable for their nature. There are gray, colorless figures to express depression and loneliness in Tomoko’s surroundings. Characters sometimes have faces with no eyes. Background designs are colorful and well-drawn. There are sometimes aerial views of a setting (e.g. inside a restaurant). Settings are diverse and brings excitement to the series, because each setting adds yet another incident to Tomoko’s life.The OP song is a heavy metal song that’s named after the anime itself, and the lyrics of ""Watamote"" describe Tomoko’s character: “I won’t accept this world until I make it to a future where I’m popular.” There are five ending songs throughout Watamote, and they all match the moods to the ending of each episode. Background music sounds like a video game, so it\'s not that special. The VAs were very good and fit each character’s personality. Izumi Kitta (voice of Tomoko) did an excellent job expressing Tomoko’s nervousness throughout the series.Enjoyment (10)Watamote is one of the best slice of life comedies I have ever watched. I sympathized with Tomoko on several occasions and found her breakdowns funny most of the time. The animation and supporting characters brought excitement to the series by highlighting the different emotions (sadness, laughter) of the anime. The pacing also demonstrated hope for Tomoko. I was disappointed with the ending, but I loved it so much that I moved onto the manga.Overall, Watamote delivers a perfect combination of reality and comedy. It takes you on a ride through the life of a socially inept girl whose primary goal is to become popular. Sympathize with Tomoko as she goes through loneliness. Enjoy (and laugh) at her several crazy schemes to get people to notice her.Tip: Watch the entire episode and enjoy the ED.

They show you people suffering, dying and cursing. They expect you to laugh because people are dying, suffering and cursing. You’re supposed to be shocked that the creators don’t mind putting these characters though such a pain, but that’s not a major achievement. Terrorists do it all the time, but it doesn’t make them comedians.A truly dark comedy is not that one avoids that darkness. It’s one that forces us to confront the darkness of it and still laugh. Even Borderlands, where the whole joke is that everyone...thinks dying is a joke has insight into violence and how we perceive it. It’s an exaggeration of the flippant treatment most video games have for violence. Likewise, WataMote is an anime that stares into the eyes of the abyss that is being socially retardedWataMote is a dark comedy. It’s far darker than any so-called ‘for adult’ cartoons from the West. It doesn’t create a bunch of punchlines and try to make the premise fit the jokes. It’s aware of the how crippling Tomoko’s situation is, and it tries to find humor among all the darkness. It uses humor not to downplay the darkness, but as a means of coping.Shyness is cute when you look at it from the outside, but so is a panda bear caged in a zoo. Tomoko has the privileges of the Western world, such as running water and food. How much of a consolation is it when you have no way to relate to the world?Human beings are social creatures. Isolation is one of the worst type of punishment you can bring on one. That’s where solitary confinement comes from. Without feedback from others to keep us in reality, it can feel like it’s slipping away from us. A similar process can happen with sensory deprivation.This is what happens to Tomoko. There is a gross contrast between how she views herself and the world, and how it really is. The world outside is not very hostile. In high school, the popular kids are too busy having fun to bully you. People will talk to you if you initiate. At worst, they’ll be indifferent.Indifference isn’t harmful in and of itself. It doesn’t target you. When that’s the only feedback you get, it becomes scary. Tomoko barely spends any time in the real world. We spend most of the episodes inside her head. In her inner monologues, she talks fast, with a steady pace and a hard voice. She’s full of energy and life.Then she opens her mouth and barely a word comes out. The people often react in confusion. You can’t expect them to react in any other way to a person who can barely utter a phrase. Since it’s not complete approval, Tomoko’s dualistic worldview sees it as negative and she runs away.That dualistic worldview is another aspect of being a social retard. Tomoko sees things in black and white. There are popular kids, and losers like her. In her eyes, Yuu turned from a loser geek to a ‘popular slut’, although all we see is that Yuu developed breasts and dyed her hair. Tomoko tries a little to fit in, and when it doesn’t work she throws the bathwater with the baby.The absurdity of social anxiety is that it makes you fail in basic, day-to-day interactions. Tomoko’s failures wouldn’t bother and otherwise well-adjusted person. People say embarassing shit all the time. Most of them say so many things that one failure doesn’t bother them. Tomoko always bets all her money on one single moment.The comedy comes from the darkness itself, from how absurd it is. We’re talking about a barrier that doesn’t exist physically. Nothing prevents Tomoko from talking with people but herself. She’s fighting a shadow. Seeing a person fight something invisible is both sad and funny at the same time.Sometimes the comedy is just from Tomoko’s failures. Thankfully, the creators are imaginative enough. They make these realistic failures, rather than inserting a poop joke or a sex joke like a lot of Western comedy does. There is also a powerful use of silence. It’s another way of pointing out the joke, but it lets the situation stand on its own. Besides, it’s a more realistic reaction to absurdity. Something absurd is something we don’t know how to react to. We may need time to think it over.Tomoko would’ve nothing without her voice actress. It’s a brilliant performance. She has to play different characters. Tomoko is a megalomaniac world-dominator in her monologues but a coward when she speaks. Her voice actress doesn’t just capture this World Dominator in her speech, but she performs it with chinks in the armor. She exaggerates the confidence so much that it’s clear Tomoko tries hard to convince herself. As for how she does Tomoko’s stuttering, I doubt any person can replicate it so well. The fact a dub was even attempted is a brave, but probably an Icarian feat.The character design fares a little worse. Tomoko isn’t really ugly. She looks odd and a distortion of the Moe design. Her eyes are huge, but have a darkness in them that looks frightening. Her figure or facial features aren’t special enough to cause any shock. She looks likes she’d rather listen to My Chemical Romance and Avenged Sevenfold rather than look for a boyfriend.The state of comedy is a poor one. Too many comedies are references to sex and shit in-between random words. It’s hard to find a comedy that understands comedy’s purpose – finding humor in the absurdity of life. If it can find humor in the darker parts, then all the better. Whatever you think of anime in general, WataMote is a great work of comedy.4 anxiety fits out of 5 thinks dying is a joke has insight into violence and how we perceive it.

Whatever you think of anime in general, WataMote is a great work of comedy.4 anxiety fits out of 5', ""We’ve all gone through a certain point where we want to feel less lonely even though our abilities for social interactions are limited for some inexplicable reason. Shows that remind us of those dark times can be polarizing for the majority to comprehend, and because of this, we don’t see many shows try to tackle the subject. The reason is that most people don’t like to revisit what made them so miserable for so long. Luckily for some of us, we always look back at those moments and laugh at how silly it was, and thanks to the show Watamote we can now have a...show that does that for us.Based on the gag manga, Watamote is set as your typical slice of life show, only this time they added some new twists that make it a little more fresh than others; dark, demented twists. It is twisted in its subject matter, but at the same time, it has a comedic overtone that compliments each other very well. You have Tomoko’s wild intentions of wanting to be popular yet unable to due to her supreme lack of social skill and the fact that she has been somewhat of a hikikomori for most of her life. The camera angles that constantly pan to her face often look distorted from the style of animation it tries to exacerbate, really giving you a sense of dread and anguish for her, yet at the same time, you can’t help but laugh at her expense. The show also goes into parody territory by showcasing your typical awkward moment of conversation, such as picking up a dropped pencil from a classmate sitting next to you. This is done with clever flashback sequences showing Kuroko’s comprehensive mindset.Sporadic and chaotic are the two words that sum up the humor of Watamote. These two aspects are a blessing and a curse to the show. The comedy in this show is very unpredictable and goes to new levels of hilarity as time goes on, but at the same time, it can get quite repetitive quickly. Repetitive in that Kuroko’s constant ramblings and random noises she makes when she goes insane are made too frequently and mostly come across as tedious than charming after a while. What saves the humor is the actual build-up of the funniest bits that feel very fresh and unexpected to see, thanks to the well-thought-out dialogue that is written in those scenes. Ones that involve Tomoko and her mother in her room as her audio recording of a male seiyuu is played in the background and joining a couple of boys peek into a love motel.One other small aspect that I truly admire about the comedy is the chemistry between Tomoko and her brother Kuroki and their hilarious dialogue exchanges with one another. Whenever they are on-screen together, you feel that this is how most siblings treat each other daily. They don’t necessarily like each other when they are in their personal space, but they’re bound by blood and can’t help but feel for each other's troubles. It’s a shame they don’t have enough screen time together. We could see some growth between them but what we have here is enough for me.To start with the characters, Tomoko is the type of person you either grew up knowing someone like her or you grew up as her, but for the most part, we’ve all been the latter. We’ve all just wanted to try to put up an act of ourselves to make us seem edgy or cool but fail miserably. Tomoko herself is the main driving point in the show who performs her antics with pure charm and sympathy, thanks in part to her voice actress Izumi Kitta who is extraordinary playing her. Her ability to create Kuroko’s personality is almost inhuman in a good way, though sometimes she performs her job too well to the point where it sounds like she’s going to pass out near the end of the take.That doesn’t mean that the other characters share the same memorability or charisma as Kuroko, except for her brother. Her best friend Yuu Naruse, played by Kana Hanazawa, is a pretty bland childhood friend type of character who isn’t given much to her performance other than to show more of Kuroko’s despair. One way to defend this is by looking at it as the fact that Kuroko is the only character that is the central focus of the entire show. The rest of the characters don’t even have to be fully developed because all we are focusing on is the main character Kuroko alone. It gives off the same loneliness feeling that she is going through to make the audience feel the same thing and make us feel contempt for her sorrow. Then again, that makes the comedy all the more meaningful and hilarious.That isn’t to say the comedy is always perfect by any means. Sometimes, we’re taken into situations that go too far, and the comedic timing doesn’t even provide any humorous feedback because of how poorly handled they are. Not that they were anything life-altering disturbing, but it’s one of those moments where you raise your one eyebrow and feel uncomfortable at the same time. While there are some hiccups here and there, the writing does jump back into the swing of things and provides endless over-the-top humor that is both dark and clever. The numerous parodies of other anime are a definite plus as well.What better way to start your typical slice of life show than when you could provide a loud, bombastic metal song to make it edgy?  No doubt the opening might alienate people because it feels out of place with the show. I would argue that it’s heavily symbolic as if we’re in Kuroko’s subconscious thought in how her thought-process is the majority of the time, and for that, it’s a pretty decent opening. The rest of the music here is fun to listen to, even though the music will eventually forget it in about two years.It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that the show is very demented to watch and might leave people with a sick feeling in their stomach, but it’s something that anyone shouldn’t pass off if they are a big fan of dark comedy and a parodied look into the otaku lifestyle. It can be a tedious ride if you can’t handle the repetitive nature of Kuroko’s random ramblings, but there’s always that moment that makes the ride worth going through. A moment that makes you have tears roll down your eyes from sheer laughter and going nuts by how bold the humor can be observed by the audience as uncomfortable. After all, we need more admirable shows like Watamote that aren’t afraid to go too far with their jokes.Grade: B show that does that for us.Based on the gag manga, Watamote is set as your typical slice of life show, only this time they added some new twists that make it a little more fresh than others; dark, demented twists. It is twisted in its subject matter, but at the same time, it has a comedic overtone that compliments each other very well. You have Tomoko’s wild intentions of wanting to be popular yet unable to due to her supreme lack of social skill and the fact that she has been somewhat of a hikikomori for most of her life. The camera angles that constantly pan to her face often look distorted from the style of animation it tries to exacerbate, really giving you a sense of dread and anguish for her, yet at the same time, you can’t help but laugh at her expense. The show also goes into parody territory by showcasing your typical awkward moment of conversation, such as picking up a dropped pencil from a classmate sitting next to you. This is done with clever flashback sequences showing Kuroko’s comprehensive mindset.Sporadic and chaotic are the two words that sum up the humor of Watamote. These two aspects are a blessing and a curse to the show. The comedy in this show is very unpredictable and goes to new levels of hilarity as time goes on, but at the same time, it can get quite repetitive quickly. Repetitive in that Kuroko’s constant ramblings and random noises she makes when she goes insane are made too frequently and mostly come across as tedious than charming after a while. What saves the humor is the actual build-up of the funniest bits that feel very fresh and unexpected to see, thanks to the well-thought-out dialogue that is written in those scenes. Ones that involve Tomoko and her mother in her room as her audio recording of a male seiyuu is played in the background and joining a couple of boys peek into a love motel.One other small aspect that I truly admire about the comedy is the chemistry between Tomoko and her brother Kuroki and their hilarious dialogue exchanges with one another. Whenever they are on-screen together, you feel that this is how most siblings treat each other daily. They don’t necessarily like each other when they are in their personal space, but they’re bound by blood and can’t help but feel for each other's troubles. It’s a shame they don’t have enough screen time together. We could see some growth between them but what we have here is enough for me.To start with the characters, Tomoko is the type of person you either grew up knowing someone like her or you grew up as her, but for the most part, we’ve all been the latter. We’ve all just wanted to try to put up an act of ourselves to make us seem edgy or cool but fail miserably. Tomoko herself is the main driving point in the show who performs her antics with pure charm and sympathy, thanks in part to her voice actress Izumi Kitta who is extraordinary playing her.

Many people including myself have been able to connect themselves to the main character Tomoko in the sense of the frustrations that they have with feeling unknown to the rest of the world.Watching this series, with the relationship between Tomoko and her younger brother Tomoki it had me thinking about how I see my relationship with my own sibling and I, how even though they didn't get along they still share memories together and take the extra step to tolerate each other.Above that, the interactions between the background characters that Tomoko had observed shows...perspective on how unaware some people may be of the others around them, if they are lonely and need company or even need somebody to talk to.I particularly enjoyed the ending of episode 11 where the class representative in charge of the culture festival, Imae, noticed Tomko was lonely after her friend Yuu had left, then got in the mascot costume and offered her a balloon. When Tomoko went to take the balloon she pulled her in for a hug. That was one of the sweetest moments I've seen.This anime also introduces very interesting music and makes several humorous references to other popular animes. If anyone is looking to watch something a little different this is definitely the series to watch. perspective on how unaware some people may be of the others around them, if they are lonely and need company or even need somebody to talk to.I particularly enjoyed the ending of episode 11 where the class representative in charge of the culture festival, Imae, noticed Tomko was lonely after her friend Yuu had left, then got in the mascot costume and offered her a balloon.

Congratulations!2) You\'re an insensitive prick. Congratulations...?Now on to the review.STORY : On the surface, this anime appears to be comedic tale of a loner who\'s desperate for attention and friends. Her situation is so bad that she can\'t even utter a word in public. That\'s it, right? No plot development, no cliché transformation to a beautiful/popular girl, and no happy ending.No, that\'s definitely not it.This anime is about a girl with social anxiety. Being someone who suffers from social anxiety, although...not on as serious level as her, I can say that there\'s nothing funny or ""pathetic"" about suffering from social anxiety. Before you go and say: ""Come on! What\'s so bad about it? Just talk to people! Make friends!"", let me just make it clear that its impossible for shy people to easily communicate or indulge with friends easily because we\'re very conscious of ourselves and our surroundings. What about delusions and fantasies? That\'s also part of being a social failure, I can vouch for that.ART : Brilliant. The character design, the background, everything about the art is brilliant. Couldn\'t find a single flaw.SOUND : Personally, I loved the opening and ending theme. The opening theme portrays the mind of someone suffering from anxiety perfectly. The anguish and envy in the song and Tomoko\'s expressions...ah, so accurate! Voice-acting was good, although you might need some time to get used to Tomoko\'s voice.CHARACTER : The main character is fantastic. She\'s realistic and not all cutesy like most anime and that\'s just what makes her so awesome. Her relationship with her brother is also realistic and cute (at some points). Yuu-chan...erm, what can I say about her? She\'s a slut.ENJOYMENT : I enjoyed it. I laughed at her misfortunes that often reminded me of my blunders in the past, and empathized with her dearly throughout the anime.OVERALL : This anime is not for everyone, that is given. Watch it if you\'re going through the same thing and half laugh, half cry while watching it (like I did). Its definitely not for people who have lots of friends and/or look down on loners. Will this make you feel fuzzy and warm inside? No, it\'s uncomfortable especially if you can relate to her. But its realistic. I can\'t emphasize on this factor enough; not everyone has a perfect high school life, you know. A realistic anime once in a while won\'t hurt\'cha, buddy. not on as serious level as her, I can say that there\'s nothing funny or ""pathetic"" about suffering from social anxiety.

Ok so the anime ""Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!"" has ended and I must say that it was a rather unique one since it is all about a typical Japanese loner\\ loser who doesn\'t seem to do anything by herself to improve her social skills. Frankly if I can compare this anime to a western cartoon the close that it would be is \'Ed, Edd and Eddie"" co\'z both features a typical teenagers whom were pretty much losers in life that I would like to whack their heads with a rolled up newspaper, except in ""Ed, Edd, and Eddie"" I \'d give those characters some respect since they\'re the kind of losers who never stopped trying, while in ""Watamote"" the girl loser never tries at all. Ok so I think I\'m gonna have to present my ratings for this anime:Story: Very Good 8.Well, I did mentioned about this anime\'s uniqueness, since its slice of life was focus on Kuroki Tomoko a loner and pessimist who procrastinates a lot, her story simply represents the very thing that every loner does and what he/she wishes which either she becomes a hokikomori if he/she is unconsciously  contented of being a loner or eventually get a life and enjoy the world provided that such determination to change oneself is present. But in this case the story of the everyday life of a loser girl like Tomoko was more amusing that one would like to be the backseat character and criticize Tomoko for not having the guts nor the fortitude to even improve herself, also the story shows us that improvement is something that one must undertook by herself, that is, if there is really a determination for one to really improve.Art: Fair 6.Well for Tomoko, at one point I\'m a little bit disgusted about her illustration, attire and facial concept, but, I can\'t deny that it was those very concept that makes her funny. Also, there is a few fanservice that me likey, like Imae\'s one time panty shot and Yuu\'s big bouncing melons.Sound: Good 7.The score is for Tomoko which includes, the way she catches her breath, her evil smirk, evil tone and of course I also like the way that her brother\'s speaking tone when he get\'s piss off by her antics. Oh, and about the opening theme, it really doesn\'t fit the anime as a whole, unless thai anime has an intense action genre, in fact the closing theme fits better as an opening theme.Character: Decent 4.I may be a bit pissed about the main character Tomoko, ok so she might have some aggression within her and her fantasies are too dark to comprehend, then again she\'s not bad to be this stupid loser high schooler, which the only types pf people she can get along with are kids and middle school perves. So the ""Decent"" score is for her.Yuu Naruse, maybe Tomoko only friend or least when they were in middle school, but the thing about her is that she doesn\'t make any effort to change Tomoko and it\'s rather annoying, then again she does provide this hot bodacious babe that\'s present in every anime\\manga.Tomoki on the other hand he is somewhat this character that I would like to give her sister a rude awakening, however just like Yuu he\'s also annoying that he doesn\'t do anything to change her sister, Tomoko.As for the mom, what I like about her is the part that she has to give Tomoko a bitch slap because of Tomoko\'s stupid antics with the vacuum cleaner.Enjoyment and Overall: Very Good 8.Like I said, this is one anime where we the audience would like to be a backseat character who would wanna give the main character a rude awakening if she ever wants to have an enjoyable high school life. Also I did mentioned about the uniqueness about this anime that deals with a typical Japanese loser which can only go two ways; become a hokikomori if he/she is  unconsciously contented of being alone and blames the world for his fate or get a life if such determination to change exist in that particular person. Overall, this is one of the best anime for this season despite of its shabby final episode.

Overall, this is one of the best anime for this season despite of its shabby final episode. The end.l', 'I. Freaking. AM. This girl.I have struggled with social anxiety most of my life.  I\'ve never felt like I belonged to part of a group, and I\'ve always felt like more of a shadow than a real person in the eyes of others. I\'m taking medication for it now, but that doesn\'t stop the pain of those memories.So for me, Watamote was like reading a very embarrassing autobiography. I related to the main character, and it made me ashamed.First off, this anime is hardcore cringe comedy. You WILL have to pause the show at least once just because watching this girl fail is so...painful. You will scream no at your television, only for your plea to fall on deaf ears and Tomoko to humiliate herself anyways. It\'s not a feel good, chortle jubilantly whilst crunching on pocky sort of anime. It\'s a face-palm-and-shake-your-head-despairingly anime. If that doesn\'t sound like a roaring good time to you, then you should probably go watch Lucky Star instead.Speaking of Lucky Star, that\'s just one of the many anime Watamote references. Ghost in the Shell, Haruhi Suzumiya, Death Note, and a plethora of other shows are visually mimicked from time to time for your viewing enjoyment. Okay, that\'s a nice shout out to otaku, I guess. And I suppose it helps emphasize Tomoko\'s otaku nature. But I can\'t help but feel like this show is more preoccupied with imitating iconic images rather than creating its own. That\'s the danger when you rely to heavily on shout-outs and references: you leave no room to make your own impression.And that is Watamote\'s visual failing. The animation is never bad, but it never goes beyond bare simplicity. You are ANIME, art incarnate, moving masterpiece, you shouldn\'t settle for mere passing. Watamote fails to create any sort of distinctive style of its own. It\'s bland. If you do not create images that stick in the mind of your audience, then you are going to be forgotten. Ironically, that\'s a lesson Tomoko is very aware of, and yet her own show fails to put it to use. So I must award you no points for style.Back to my own neuro-chemical failings: as someone with social anxiety, I understand what it is like to struggle to connect with people in a way that is meaningful. Watamote definitely got that message across. Unfortunately, it provides no light at the end of the tunnel, and thus ends up feeling somewhat hollow. Now, mental illness is a hard subject to portray, because it does not lend itself to a satisfying story-arc. You do not OVERCOME things like anxiety and depression. There is no final battle, no clear climax. Instead, it is a slow, uphill struggle. There is no end, because it\'s not something that ever goes away. That makes a satisfying conclusion almost impossible. A person can\'t just suddenly ""get better"" from internal struggles. If they do, it comes across as contrived and insincere (see the TV ending of Evangelion). Victory against mental struggles is so gradual that it can be hard to see, which is why it can be very unsatisfying for an audience to watch.Watamote falls into the trap of trying to show character development in a way that is thematically satisfying, but distant from real life. The conclusion of the show has some last-minute growth from our main character, probably in order to give its audience a freaking bone after all that torture. However, as someone who has struggled with this same issue (and as such as the likely target audience of the show), I know that sort of change doesn\'t happen. I don\'t want to see the main character be able to put aside all their anxiety with the click of a button, because I know that kind of change isn\'t lasting. Poor Tomoko will be back to her regular behavior in a week, with no permanent improvement.Instead of trying to make things look magically better, why not just give her small victories throughout? That\'s how real progress is made. It comes not from willing your situation away, but slowly learning to deal with it. Show her continuing to reach out to people in her own minute, faltering ways. Then, even if she fails, help build that gradual change in her perception that she is learning to deal with rejection and failure, so it isn\'t as crushing. At the very least, have her experience empathy towards others, and learn to focus less on her internal, selfish problems, and more on being able to sympathize with others.I\'m just ranting now. All in all, it is refreshing to see this sort of main character. I mean, how often do you see a female nerd as the main protagonist? Practically never. And despite my gripes, the show was fun to watch, even if it occasionally made my stomach turn. However, I wouldn\'t recommend this show to anyone who isn\'t hard core otaku. If you aren\'t some sort of social misfit, it might be hard to find common ground with Tomoko, and would make her very hard to relate to. Which funny enough, is pretty much her struggle within the show. Watamote is a strange little piece, and most people will probably just want to ignore it. But whether you acknowledge it or not, it\'s still there, waiting for someone to notice. painful.

But whether you acknowledge it or not, it\'s still there, waiting for someone to notice.', 'autistic girl swagger.watamote perfectly captures what its like (at least in my experience) growing up as an autistic losergirl outcasta lot of criticisms i see are reasons why i love it so much so i want to give my opinion on the main ones-painfully uncomfortable to watch-tomoko is pretty shitty most of the time-nothing happens and she doesnt make progress/get any better...1. painfully uncomfortable to watchit is uncomfortable to watch because its uncomfortable to live through. being a complete outcast is uncomfortable and relentless. its uncomfortable because its a realistic depiction of life in an uncomfortable situation2. tomoko is pretty shitty most of the timeprobably one of my favourite things about watamote. its a shitty situation and being a good person is not realistic most of the time but it doesnt make her a fundamentally bad person. try to put yourself in her shoes, you feel so alone and rejected by everyone and it hurts of course youre going to internalise it and start to dislike people - other people represent all of the hurt and all of the rejection and the life that you want so desperately but cant have, shes not a bad person shes just a kid struggling alone3. nothing happens and she doesnt make progress/get any betterwelcome to being a chronically socially inept + socially anxious social reject kekekps. if anyone reading this is in the same situation i know how shitty it is and how relentless it feels but there is a happy life out there waiting for you n i hope u find it i know its not easy but you can do this n u deserve to be loved n all that goofy stuff <3good luck out there soldier, godspeed *salute* :) 1. painfully uncomfortable to watchit is uncomfortable to watch because its uncomfortable to live through. being a complete outcast is uncomfortable and relentless. its uncomfortable because its a realistic depiction of life in an uncomfortable situation2. tomoko is pretty shitty most of the timeprobably one of my favourite things about watamote. its a shitty situation and being a good person is not realistic most of the time but it doesnt make her a fundamentally bad person. try to put yourself in her shoes, you feel so alone and rejected by everyone and it hurts of course youre going to internalise it and start to dislike people - other people represent all of the hurt and all of the rejection and the life that you want so desperately but cant have, shes not a bad person shes just a kid struggling alone3. nothing happens and she doesnt make progress/get any betterwelcome to being a chronically socially inept + socially anxious social reject kekekps. if anyone reading this is in the same situation i know how shitty it is and how relentless it feels but there is a happy life out there waiting for you n i hope u find it i know its not easy but you can do this n u deserve to be loved n all that goofy stuff <3good luck out there soldier, godspeed *salute* :)', 'I have no idea how to open up this review to be honest. WataMote was one of the first animes I saw in 2014 as ridiculous at that might sound. So when I first saw it most of it references with the exception of Battle Royale and Dragon Ball Z flew over my head. What drew me in was the lead character and how I find her likable. Tomoko kept me coming back despite how embarrassing the situations she got herself into were. However, a whole year has past with me now into anime alongside having found a couple of titles that influenced my standards...for certain genres. Seeing WataMote is similar to seeing a friend you haven’t seen in a year; do you accept them despite never changing or you do ignore them and move on. Well aware of the consequences I still chose the former.Mixed: A decent setup that refuses to move past the status quoWataMote is an episodic slice of life comedy anime series that focuses on the misadventures of Tomoko Kuroki in her quest to become popular in high school. Kinda small scale popularity, but it’s what her heart’s desires. The first episode does an excellent job establishing how much of a social outcast Tomoko is and her extreme social anxiety. Managing to be entertaining despite only focusing on a single character. Within its first episode it showed there some promise to be seen in the series if it develops beyond the initial premise. Unfortunately, once past the halfway mark any hopes of that will be thrown out of the window if it’s not already.Its main brand of humor is referential humor or Tomoko reaction in a given situation. Unfortunately referential humor does makeup for large portions of it jokes. Some referential jokes will work even without getting the reference because of Tomoko over the top reaction in the situation, but the more direct and specific ones won’t work unless you have some knowledge to what it’s referencing. Simultaneously doing referential humor correctly and incorrectly. Tomoko never gives a normal reaction making a big deal out of everything. In episode 12, she imagines squashing a cockroach will lead to the entire class clapping and cheering her name out loud. Situation that Tomoko is put into changes from episode to episode. One episode will have her spending her whole summer in her room while another focuses on her attempting to get cuter by playing otome video games. The humor never evolves from how it starts out, but the variety in situations prevent it from getting as stale as it could have gotten. Another way it changes the humor up is by introducing a supporting character for Tomoko to interact with for a short length or an entire episode. Breaking the usual formula while staying in line with its specific brand of humor.The biggest pitfall of WataMote is it desire to return to the status quo by the end of every episode. What progress is made is unimportant in the long run like Tomoko impressing her cousin or seeing an old friend from middle school. This makes her endeavor come across as a lost cause and as a viewer makes it reluctant to want to stick around to the end. However, no matter the embarrassing situations Tomoko gets herself into, the anime isn’t mean spirited. None of the characters mistreat her in any way. At most, Tomoki Kuroki (Tomoko’s younger brother) acting like siblings is about as cruel as it gets. This is counteracted by the fact that everything that happens to her in the series is her fault. Now due to the status quo effect the fact nothing changes for Tomoko in any positive way might make it depressing.The ending...it’s something. How to classify it as is difficult. For starter, the narrator flat out tells the viewer that “This is a story about a peculiar girl. An unpopular girl, and it really doesn’t matter” at the end of the final episode. That line is equal to a middle finger to your face. The same final scene continues with Tomoko getting the final line that hints at some possible progression on her outlook on popularity. What you’re ultimately left with is an ending where it’s the only time narrative and character progress can be made cutting the story there instead of taking risks. Playing it safe with its comfortable doing, but also tells the viewer itself it doesn’t matter if they see it.Mixed: A great lead, but under utilize supporting castWatamote only character worth paying attention too is it lead Tomoko Kuroki. She’s a “down to Earth” character whose social anxiety makes her easy to relate too. Receiving most of the characterization through her many monologues developing various aspect about her personality from what she likes, her hobbies, her past, her thought process, and anything you can imagine. Like mentioned before, the series ends without progression. For as much development she receives she is too a static character who doesn’t learn nor changes. She is also a double edge sword; If you don’t like Tomoko Kuroki then the anime will fail. This also effect the supporting cast since Tomoko is the sole focus in every single episode. If you hate her then it wrote itself into a corner by offering no other character to latch onto or explore.The supporting cast don’t receive enough characterization to stand on their own. Their only purpose is to interact with Tomoko to break up its own formula. Tomoki Kuroki whenever on screen is usually disgusted or annoyed at the sight of his big sister. Much like Tomoko, whenever Tomoki is on screen the humor lies in how he react to Tomoko. There’s no variation on how Tomoki is use within the story. Another supporting character is Yuu Naruse, a middle school friend of Tomoko who goes to a different high school. Tomoko interaction with Yuu are good times for Tomoko whenever she feeling down. It’s breather to see Tomoko speak with another person semi-sucessfully who isn’t her brother.That about wraps up the semi-important supporting characters. Tomoki and Yuu are the only ones who receive partial screen time or play an important role in an episode in some way. Other supporting characters include Tomoko parents who don’t have many moments of good parenting. Ki is Tomoko cousin who appears in one episode than is never heard off again. There’s also certain students in Tomoko classes that are often shown, but don’t come into the picture aside from being criticize by Tomoko. Among them is a student council president who goes out of her way to cheer Tomoko up. Sadly, the series ends before it could anything with that development.Good: A solid direction holds a small budget togetherWataMote animation is done by Silver Link favoring flashiness over consistency for this anime. The animation isn’t stellar in any area, but works nonetheless. It simply looks fine with some questionable choices that fall under artistic and laziness. The opening animation is artistic showing Tomoko wanting to break free from her chains of unpopularity while the ending animation shows how she actually deals with it. Laziness comes in the form of background characters in several episodes being animated without any eyes drawn on. Some choices are questionable in execution. Episode 4 opens with Tomoko surfing on a website. Within the first couple of seconds there’s a promo displaying on the site that Tomoko is on promoting the anime adaptation of WataMote. If the character in the promo was design differently it would be a decent visual gag that broke the fourth wall, but instead what it does is break immersion. If a character that looks exactly like our lead is used in promos it begs the question why she isn’t considered popular in within the anime.Backgrounds are simplistic reusing the limited locations alongside with Tomoko having the only notable character design. Lighting in many scenes are done with multiple hexagons or large circles inside smaller same shapes. In order to color in different shading, though even if the scene takes place at night time everything still looks bright. Some of the animation shortcoming is made up by incorporating different art styles whenever Tomoko goes on one of her rants or fantasy the animation style changes so suit her emotion. Often time nailing the exact look and style of what it’s referencing in that scene. Another positive is the animation nailed Tomoko expressions being hysterical when a joke works or when there’s a cringeworthy moment on screen.Izumi Kitta excels in the lead role of Tomoko Kuroki in the Japanese cast. She’s fully committed to the role on all account. Delivering a natural performance as a dysfunctional high school girl while making her likable. Kitta is never too showy whenever delivering her more outrageous monologues and never over sells it during the more tender moments. Perfectly balancing the various bottled up emotion of Tomoko. The fact that Izumi Kitta was able to make a character who sometimes blames her social anxiety on other people sympathetic is a huge praise for how well she did in the role.The English dub is done by Sentai Filmworks and the only casting choice they needed to get absolutely right was Tomoko Kuroki. Monica Rail is a talented actress, but unfortunately her performance lacks the finesse that Izumi Kitta brought to the same character. Monica Rail sounds force exaggerating her dialogue no matter if the context demanded it or not. Creating a character who instead of being socially awkward turns into a person who doesn’t know how to act human. Another downside to Monica Rail in the lead role is she does not sing in the English dub of the anime. The closing themes for a majority of the episodes has Tomoko singing the ending theme. Hearing the same character go from speaking awkwardly in English, then singing in Japanese in a charming way in several episodes is distracting. Overall, it’s not entirely a bad performance. Monica Rail has a good sense of comedic timing in her delivery. While Izumi Kitta is the better Tomoko all around Monica Rail attempt at the role is decent occasionally delivering a good laugh. If anything, it’s worth checking out at least once to listen to Monica Rail says thing like “I need to turn myself into a high school slut” that goes against the clean image of some other characters she voices.Dialogue changes in the English dub are minor in general. Some phrases received changes so it could be more digestible for Western audiences. For example, Tomoko says in episode 5 “I’ll probably find something lewd in his room” in the English sub while in the English dub it was translated too “I’ll probablly find some porno in his room”. Dialogue changes like these don’t affect anything important. The English wording for some comedic lines loses their comedic touch upon delivering in writing and performance. In episode three, there’s a scene where Tomoko says “I-I figured I would go take a really messy shit in the bathroom or something” when talking to two guys in the rain. When Izumi Kitta delivers the line it’s comical as well as cringeworthy. When Monica Rail says “I-I just got to take a dump outside that restroom” it’s just comes off awkward. Several scenes can lose a semblance of comedy making you question if it’s a comedy at all. Finally, Sentai Filmworks felt the need to include subtitles to explain references in the English dub. Don’t know why they felt the need to do that since it won’t change if the joke itself is funny or not in execution. In both, the supporting cast get minimal usage. It’s because of this both supporting cast comes off as being equal in the voice acting department. Good performances for the limited time they receive, but not enough to make them memorable.If you had to choose between the sub or English dub without a doubt go for the sub. Even if the comedic lines were directly translated in the English dub Izumi Kitta simply embodies the leading role far better than Monica Rail. Izumi Kitta sounds natural whereas Monica Rail is more in line of an embarrassing grandmother speaking like a teen in an effort to be hip. Also, the small fact hearing Izumi Kitta sing the closing theme gives Tomoko more charm when she optimistically sings about her social life to improve. Monical Rail doesn’t even sing when playing Tomoko which is immediately distracting in the English seeing a character speaking English singing in another language she doesn’t speak in within the anime.The music is done by a group called Sadesper Record. Made up of composers Goro Watari (also goes by NARASAKI) and Masaki Oshima (also know as WATCHMAN) both of whom provide an OST comprised of electronic, comical, orchestrated, and hard rock music. The OST works fine in the anime series being diverse as it needs to be to complement the loner slice of life moments to the over exaggeration of Tomoko fantasies. It’s pleasant to listen too, but fail in comparison to the opening and closing themes of the series which are memorable without the company of the anime visuals. The opening theme is a hard rock song called “Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui"" sung by Konomi Suzuki and Kiba of Akiba. It’s a hard rock song that fits with the anime capturing Tomoko bottle up emotion to break free.Watamote despite being a twelve episode long anime has five different ending themes. The most use track for the ending is ""Dou Kangaete mo Watashi wa Warukunai"" by Izumi Kitta in episodes 1, 3, 4, 7 - 10, and 12. It’s an upbeat pop song that’s fun to listen to everytime. “Musou Renka” by Velvet.kodhy is used in episode 2 and it’s forgettable. It’s a alternative rock song with mixture of rap and hip hop splice together speeding up and slowing down it’s instrumental. Vocals that need work hitting high note and actual emotion because the singing sounds phoned in. Ironically, “Yoru no Tobari yo Sayonara” also by Velvet.kodhy in episode 5 has none of those problems. It’s a silly song with the vocalist singing in a deep voice and its done well. Going perfectly with the closing animation referencing the ending animation of Manga Nihon Musashi Banashi. Though, these two tracks aren’t memorable without the company of the anime visuals. “Sokora no Nuigurumi no Fuusen to Watashi” by Velvet.kodhy and Velvet.kodhy and μ and μ is another pleasant track used in episode 11. It has a feel good aura about it. From it two vocalist sharing a good time singing together and it’s joyous instrumentals. “Natsu Matsuri” by Utsu-P & Minatsukitoka ft. Hatsune Miku is used in episode 6. Combining foreboding piano music before going into techno sound bytes, with hard rock guitar strings, and robotic sounding autotune singing. This track is the closest the anime gets to matching the rock opening.Personal Enjoyment: Enjoyable, but with apparent flawsI did find the English dub inferior because Monica Rail wasn’t quite on par with voice actress Izumi Kitta. However, I did get a kick listening to Monica Rail say things I never expected to hear from her. That made the dub worth seeing even if the performance wasn’t quite to the level I wanted it to be at. Having seen this anime again in English I was able to catch more references than I was before. Not of all of them were subtle like a reference to Battle Royale and anything specifically named is hard to missed. The references I caught having seen WataMote again were Death Note, Tomoki Kuroki reading volume 8 of Arachnid in episode one, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and Attack on Titan. Unfortunately, WataMote wasn’t quite as good as I remembered when I first saw it and boils down to nothing happens nor changes. It’s a static series were the potential is there to grow beyond the initial idea, but doesn’t know how to go about doing it. I still like the anime and find Tomoko Kuroki an endearing awkward character, but when the anime itself says it’s unimportant it epitomizes the down side for some slice of life animes. Good for the moment, but nothing that’ll remain with you forever.Story: 2/3Characters: 2/3Production: 2/3Personal Enjoyment: 1/1Final Thoughts:WataMote is a fun series to see no how awkward the situations got for Tomoko. It’s not a mean spirited anime since the main character is never mistreated by others, but has the potential to get depressing when realizing it’s her own fault for not improving herself. What it does provide is a lead character whose easily relatable among those with social anxiety, some killer tunes that either make you want to rock out too or cheer you up, and a stellar performance by Izumi Kitta. This anime floats or sink on the appeal of it’s lead in a static environment. If even after reading this entire review you still don’t know to check out the anime ask yourself if you want a dynamic or static story from this premise? If you choose the former go onto something else, but if you choose the latter enjoy sharing the same awkward experiences as Tomoko that few slice of life animes will touch upon. for certain genres.

If you choose the former go onto something else, but if you choose the latter enjoy sharing the same awkward experiences as Tomoko that few slice of life animes will touch upon.', ""This review contains no spoilers.Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui, or in short Watamote, is a comedy anime about an otaku girl with null social skills and her attempts to become more popular now that her high school life has begun.What started as a fun show filled with hilarious jokes and awkward yet relatable situations (albeit exaggerated to the extreme) quickly turned repetitive and monotonous as more episodes came in. It's one of those times where wrong expectations can kill an anime: I actually expected character development. Unfortunately, that never happened.Let's start with the characters. Tomoko is our main character, a...girl with abysmal social skills or self confidence that is addicted to anime, manga and videogames. Her younger brother, Tomoki, a 'normal' guy who always has to put up with Tomoko's weird behavior, often putting a dent on his patience. And finally (yes, already), Tomoko's middle school nerdy female friend, Yuu, who not only did a 180° turn for high school, but also grew up noticeably in many ways. Note that she's not in the same high school as Tomoko anymore, however.Three characters and a few episodic ones not worth mentioning, and that's it. Most if not all the episodes revolve around Tomoko's attempts to becoming more popular through a bizarre and ineffective method (often using her otaku 'knowledge') that always seem to backfire, much to her dismay. The other half of the times she's feeling out of place and lonely...  and that's it.It was funny at first but then it became tedious to watch. The delivery is just too similar every single episode, nothing really happens or improves. Watamote is filled with parodies (probably one of the better aspects), delusions and awkward situations that in the end turn to despair. While the mix of sadness and comedy was nicely done most of the times, it also grew thin as the series went on. Like I already said, if I knew from the start that I should have NOT expected any development, maybe I would have liked Watamote more, yet I kept waiting for something to happen and in the end I was only disappointed time and time again.I enjoyed greatly the first 1-3 eps, then the enjoyment decayed a little more every episode up until the anti-climactic finale. You know something's wrong when by the final episodes you keep checking how much time is left until it's over, or when you start to fall asleep while watching.Animation, voice acting or sound. Nice job on those, got no complaints. Though the OP is a little overrated and unfitting. Those chains are never broken in the actual anime.Detailed analysis GO!General:Atmosphere 8/10 --- Successfully showcased an otaku's life, although exaggerated for laughs.Characters  5/10 --- Too few, too little development. Tomoko was likable at first but she became a little annoying over time (because she never really changed and kept expecting different results).Story development & ending 2/10 --- You could start watching any episode and not be able to tell if you're in the beginning, the middle or by the end. By episode 11 she greets her teacher in the exact same way as it happened in episode 1, that basically tells you that NOTHING actually changed, not one thing. The ending was also patheticTechnical:Art 8/10 --- No complaints.Soundtrack 8/10 --- Okay OP, cute ED and a fitting soundtrack.Voice acting 8/10 --- I think Tomoko was done greatly. I couldn't picture her sounding any different.Personal:Priority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 7/10 --- I never watch airing shows. I prefer to watch them once they're completely out. At first I would be hyped about a new Watamote weekly episode, but halfway or so... not that much.Memorability 4/10 --- Really didn't care when it ended. I won't be remembering this one.Final score:6/10 --- OkayOverall Watamote is a decent comedy anime (especially if you can somehow relate to how accurately they represent Tomoko's problems)  and if I had to rate only the first 1-3 episodes I'd give it an 8 or even 9, but sadly taking into account the entire show I must drop it to a 6, and even then I think I'm being generous (If I had to rate the last 6 eps alone... heh).Tomoko is not a saint, so expect some slight sexual themes and minor fanservice. I'd rate it for 12-13 years teens and older.That's all I got for now, I hope you enjoyed this review! girl with abysmal social skills or self confidence that is addicted to anime, manga and videogames.

I\'ll just start by answering my own question and basically explain to you the things you will say while watching this:"" Man, I\'m so grateful for my life.""""Sadly, I can relate.""""I have so much second hand embarrassment for her..."""" NO NO NO NO NOOOOOO,DON""T DO IT, GAHHH, I CAN\'T WATCH HER MESS HER LIFE UP!!""...""Tomoko, that\'s not how life works...*facepalm*.""So that\'s pretty much all your feels in a nutshell....--Story-- 8/10Created by Nico Tanigawa and watched by several idiots, Watamote is about an anti-social 15 year old girl who\'s always wanted to be popular. In addition, she is somewhat an otaku and very pessimistic yet she thinks very highly of herself. Throughout the series, you get to watch Tomoko\'s struggle to becoming popular. The anime is episodic so you see something new and weird in every episode, even some ecchi scenes are included in Watamote (how\'s that for advertising). In most situations, she\'s the girl anime version of Bad Luck Brian, which, in that aspect, really makes the show hilarious. Watamote is an anime where, whether you like it or not really just depends on your type of humor. However, this brings me back to the ""watched by several idiots"" part. If you\'re a person who is ""innocent"" per say, Watamote  isn\'t for you. I\'ve seen many people saying "" This is so inappropriate, it advertises how girls should feel in a wrong way!"" I have to disagree with that, now, I understand that some scenes maybe offensive however, it\'s supposed to be for comedy and it\'s anime, what do you expect?  Not only that, but you learn a lesson from all of the protagonist\'s faults and if you don\'t catch the moral of the episode then boiiii, you best be gettin dat education.--Art-- 7/10The art style was average. Most of the characters looked like any other typical anime characters and had the same body shape and appearance. The backgrounds weren\'t anything great, though, they were realistic, but, again, typical. On the upside, the productions did very well depicting the animation to match the look and feels of characters and situations. They also made some scenes quite distinctive from any other comedy anime.--Sound-- 9/10The OST is splendid. Both the opening and ending are very unique for an anime like Watamote. The background music does a great job at setting the mood for a situation as well. Sometimes, the sound is very happy go lucky at first then it would languish, depending on the situation. The seiyuu\'s also did a fantastic job at voice acting, Tomoko\'s voice couldn\'t have been any better. Overall, the sound is one of the most memorable parts of Watamote and definitely humorous.--Character-- 7/10The characters in Watamote were quite flat. Tomoko is the only actual character the other characters that show up consistently are her brother, Tomoki and her friend, Yuu-chan. The rest of the cast are insignificant and only show up in one episode. With Tomoko\'s iilogical thinking and werid predicaments. It\'s nice to have someone like her brother to keep the viewers sane.--Enjoyment-- 9/10Despite the flaws, Watamote was definitely enjoyable. I anticipated every episode and every episode kept me intrigued. Whether its\'s the humor, music, Tomoko, the illogically thinking or even the offensive scenes, this anime is memorable. Watamote is an anime that I will re-watch when I\'m feelin down in the dumps, just to get a good laugh.--Overall-- 8/10The anime overall was average, however, due to the unique and comedic elements, I rate Watamote with a 8/10. I recommend this to people who are looking for something relatable or amusing. Until next time, goodbye my fellow organisms.P.S.

This is my second review so feedback is much appreciated ^_^', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)Growing up as a kid entails many different aspects. How many friends do I have? What is the next event to go to? Does the girl from my math class have an interest in me? In short, many teenagers worry about their ""popularity."" Because being popular nets you more of everything that high school life has to offer. Watamote is such a story of obtaining this ever-wanted goal, but with a rather unorthodox spin.STORYWatamote features Tomoko, a young girl just starting her high school life. Not wanting to stick to the past, she decides she will take measures...to eventually become as popular as she aims to be.It becomes rather apparent rather quickly that such a feat for her is nigh impossible. Without a doubt, this is by far the most cringe-inducing show I have ever seen. Every episode is filled with moments that depict Tomoko attempting to increase her status in the social hierarchy, but with the result always ending in failure. This is not a joke. Every single time she is raised up, even slightly, she is immediately beaten back down past where she started. In this regard, the show actually does a surprisingly good job of varying up the many different situations that Tomoko finds herself in. And because of this, you are constantly feeling extremely awkward with what is going on, in a good way.Now, something that the show aims to do is to showcase or at least demonstrate this type of person. There are people out there like this, who cannot express their feelings, talk with other people easily, or who are constantly trying to make their lives better. Are they all as far left as Tomoko is? Certainly not; she is the epitome of what it means to be a recluse. But this is a start. While you may not believe that everyday people are struggling with similar issues as her, Watamote wants you to realize that these people do exist, who do have incredible difficulty when it comes to making the ""correct"" choices in every day life.One of the interesting things that the show brings to light is both the way in which it begins and the way in which it ends. That is, essentially what happens doesn\'t matter. You might be asking yourself, ""Doesn\'t this contradict what you said before?"" Actually, no. Because this is the right side of the spectrum; after all of the embarrassing-beyond-words events that she goes through, it\'s also important to remember that sometimes you have to just accept the past for what it is, and just better yourself. Everyone makes mistakes (some more then others), and sometimes just learning to move on is the best course of action.ANIMATIONThe art style of Watamote is both generic and unique. It has the rather plain-Jane friend and the typical younger brother for character designs. But it\'s Tomoko\'s design that garners the most attention. This is simply because she always has this disheveled, worn look about her throughout the vast majority of the show. Instead of depicting a cute, quirky ""nerd,"" they capture the essence of a shut-in well. With her crow\'s feet, dark circles, messy black hair, pale skin, small demeanor, and average looks, she\'s actually not attractive at all. And that\'s the point.Another thing of note in terms of art was the decision to usually use a technique in which Tomoko\'s outward appearance wasn\'t matching her inner thoughts. The show would flip between dull, boring grays to harsh, vibrant reds, greens, and purples to achieve a nice dichotomy between her gloomy and loud personalities. It was executed nicely because again it really demonstrated who Tomoko was.Sadly, the animation isn\'t as stellar. To be honest, it isn\'t anything more than average. Not a lot happens within the show, since it\'s mostly dialogue or inner-monologue by Tomoko, but even for the things that are going on, there isn\'t much movement. This is true for Tomoko herself, the rest of the cast, and the environment as a whole.CHARACTERSWriting a thesis on Tomoko alone should be possible, but I\'ll stick to a shorter version. In short, she is the only character within the show, which is something that I haven\'t really experienced. There are almost always supporting characters to back the main ones up, but in the grand scheme of things, they don\'t matter in this anime.So, Tomoko. I\'ll split her characterization into four different parts that I feel are the most significant: her self-denial, her determination to become something more, her ironically wanting to be what she hates, and how she doesn\'t develop overall. It\'s a lot to cover, but bear with me.First, her self-denial. This is something that plagues her throughout the entire show, and is the underlying cause for why she experiences such cringe-y situations. When she concocts her plans and goes about them, the result she gets is never looked at. Instead of capitalizing on what she did right or wrong, she just moves on to the next idea. Thus, perpetuating the self-denial she has every time.Second, is her determination. Oddly enough, despite her social awkwardness, she tries her hardest at everything she does. It\'s one of her greatest qualities that goes unnoticed by everyone (including perhaps herself). It\'s this part of her that the viewer likes. I want her to succeed at talking to the boy at the library, I want to see her having fun with her friend at the cultural festival. And it saddens me when I see all of her effort go to waste because what she chose to do in the end just wasn\'t right.On the opposite side, her ultimate goal actually is to be the very thing she hates, a ""bitch."" Being immensely popular, having tons of friends, and nailing a boyfriend are her dreams. And yet, every chance she gets, she bashes these very people for their, what she calls, idiotic ideas. This side of her you hate, in a well done way. Her ""true self"" is rude, crazy, and somewhat evil. This side of her makes me not want to see her succeed, because she almost doesn\'t deserve it for how much she puts it down.My last point on Tomoko is that her only issue is that she never develops as a character. Now, this is probably an entire point of the show; that she really isn\'t supposed to. But I would have liked to have seen some type of realization, whether that be with her self-denial, her determination, or her self-conscious, rather than her never making progress one way or the other.SOUNDThe OP is pretty sick. Metal, harsh, and filled with great guitar and drum solos, it is oddly fitting for the show. It matches Tomoko\'s desire to ""break free"" from the chains that are holding her back. I loved it a lot, but rock \'n\' roll/metal music is a personal favorite of mine, so I\'m slightly biased here.The ED is amazing not because it has good music or good lyrics, but because of Tomoko. Once again, it is oddly fitting because it incorporates her super awkward behavior throughout it. You would never listen to this song on its own, because it only works within the context of the show, and it works very well.The soundtrack for Watamote is also very good. It contains metal guitar riffs, choir singing, and other strange instrument/vocal combinations that fit the mood and the situations perfectly.Above all, I want to say that Izumi Kitta\'s voice acting performance as Tomoko deserves the highest of praise from everyone. The range she covered was large, but it did not faze her. It is one of the best VA performances I have had the pleasure of hearing (right up there with Okabe from Steins;Gate), and she deserves every accolade because of it. Seriously, she did a beyond exceptional job.ENJOYMENTI think many people look at the show, start watching it, and really only rate it based on how ""dumb"" it is. ""Dumb"" in this case meaning how incredibly cringe-inducing, awkward, and embarrassing it always is. Meaning, if people like those types of scenarios, they love the show, and vice versa. But this anime is more than that.It\'s funny when it needs to be, it\'s insightful when it tries, and it makes you see things that are almost never talked about. The cringe part of the show is definitely its strongest point (outside of Tomoko), but only judging the show based on that isn\'t fair.I really liked the transitions that the show used, the censoring it incorporated, Tomoko\'s super quiet and stuttering public talking, and all of her silly plans that just never went her way. It\'s not a show that I adored, but I liked what it had to offer.In the end, if you can endure the cringe, Watamote deserves more credit than it gets. While Tomoko may have been unsuccessful in her endeavors to become supremely popular, if I could tell her one thing, it would be that that she has at least one fan in the books.SUMMARYStory: Great, cringe-galore gives an interesting outlookAnimation: Good, stale animation but cool art style and directionCharacters: Good, Tomoko, like her, is just shy of being one of the greatsSound: Great, sick OP, unique ED, nice soundtrack, outstanding VA performance by Izumi KittaEnjoyment: Good, this one is more than meets the eyeFinal Score: 8/10 to eventually become as popular as she aims to be.It becomes rather apparent rather quickly that such a feat for her is nigh impossible.

The anime adaptation was handled by Silver Link, the studio behind Baka to Test (one of the worst things I've ever seen), and they've produced nothing else I've seen. I just hope this is nothing like their other slice of life comedy or I'm in for roughly three unfunny, unpleasant and problematic jokes repeated over and over and over again until I have to go back on anti-depressants. Let's take a...look.The “story” focuses on the High school life of Tomoko Kuroki, an unpopular girl who barely interacts with her classmates. Not that there's anything wrong with preferring solitude. The problem is that Tomoko wants to make friends and interact with people, but the only people she can talk to normally are her family and the vast majority of her social experiences come from dating sims. So, how well do the comedic elements work? To be honest, they don't. Most of the jokes are based either on Tomoko doing things that are kind of stupid or socially awkward or based on her general lack of social graces. And there's a big difference between awkward and funny. They can overlap, but they don't very often and this series isn't good enough to pull that off. Consequently, a lot of the series just drags and involves nothing of consequence or interest happening. Just long periods of Tomoko's inner monologue, which can basically be summarised as “I wish I was more popular. Maybe if I tried *insert stupid thing here* I could change my image and be popular.” It might have been good for a few laughs if her ideas were interesting or if the execution had been good, but that doesn't happen. Her ideas are stupid and usually lead to a few gags that you'll probably be able to see coming really quickly and which would only be mildly amusing at best if you didn't anticipate them.The characters in this aren't interesting. You've got the socially inept Tomoko. Her more popular younger brother who basically serves the purpose of pointing out her failings and occasionally giving her her comeuppance. Their parents, who are pretty much only there for reaction shots and to do generic parent things. They don't even have names, that's how generic they are. The only other important character is Yuu, Tomoko's only friend. The rest of the characters are relegated to the background and rarely get to say or do anything or they're one-shot characters who show up in an episode or two. With so few reoccurring characters, you'd think they could take some time to develop them. They don't. The only one who gets even a slight amount of development is Tomoko. Who goes from being socially inept to showing very slight signs of improvement by the end. And the series never gives you a reason to care. Yes, she's pathetic, but she's also pretty unsympathetic and her problems are almost entirely her own fault.The art isn't very good. A lot of the animation looks kind of blocky. Furthermore, Watamote as a whole is just kind of lazy. There are a lot of scenes that linger for no real reason. The worst offender is one of Tomoko's fantasy scenes that lasts for about five minutes and has really slowly moving, stagnant art. The worst part is that there's absolutely no reason for it to go that slowly. The scene isn't funny, nor does it do anything for the narrative. My guess is that they just drug it out so they wouldn't have to animate as much. There are also scenes that get pretty much recycled. The backgrounds are pretty bare minimum as are the character designs.The sound is... okay. Kitta Izumi does a decent job of sounding painfully shy. But most of the characters don't have a range of emotions to work with so their performances end up kind of flat. Nakamura Yuuichi, for example, just sounds annoyed with every line of dialogue he's given. Hanazawa Kana gets two emotions. Vaguely excited and concerned. All in all, there's no chance for the actors to shine.The Ho-yay factor is a 3/10. Tomoko has a pretty obvious crush on Yuu, at one point going so far as to fantasize about groping her. But they never do anything with it except for the occasional throw away line or scene that heavily implies it.That was Watamote. Is it as bad as Baka to test? Well, no. The “humour” in it may fall flat and it may drag, but it's not terrible or infuriating, mostly.  The characters, as underdeveloped as they are, are still stronger than the characters in Baka to Test. But while it's not terrible, it's also not good. Watamote's biggest problem is just that it's dull. You get long stretches of nothing followed by an awkward moment that you're supposed to find funny because... Tanigawa thinks awkward equates to funny? My final rating is going to be a 3/10. I can really only recommend it if you think awkward moments are hilarious. Otherwise you're probably going to be as thoroughly unamused as I was. Next week, Dennou Coil. look.The “story” focuses on the High school life of Tomoko Kuroki, an unpopular girl who barely interacts with her classmates.

Next week, Dennou Coil."", ""Considering the anime I watched so far, there are 2 types of 'Slice of Life' anime: regular, and Watamote. Watching characters living their lives is one thing. But another thing is watching only one character TRYING to live her life.And what a life it is. Kuroki Tomoko, antisocial otaku striving to become popular in her new school. We watch her as she struggles to interact with people in situations like… saying “Hello!” and “Goodbye!”. But there are also things she shines at - playing video games and watching anime...That’s the part of her, I kinda liked. I must confess,  I’m a shut-in myself. Of...course, unlike her, I do have friends… I swear! Anyway, she tries her best to meet someone in new class. But I believe, one thing she’s got wrong, is that she waits for others to make the first move. Her contribution is minimal.As I said, it’s different from other ‘Slice of life’ anime, where social interactions are the basics I guess. Who would watch anime where protagonist is awkward and can’t talk properly to other people? Well, look at the number of fans of Watamote, and you get the answer. But that doesn’t mean it’s for everyone. As we can read from discussions and reviews, it’s a show, that’s sometimes hard to watch. For me, especially when the second half started, watching the show was really painful, and made me realize how weird I may look to other people.Tomoko IS weird. And sometimes… unappealing. When I started watching, I thought “Oh, she’s just quiet and kinda kawaii girl”. But then, near the end I realized… that’s not the case, and the way she acts… just how can she be the protagonist? There are A LOT of embarrassing moments waiting for her. I often empathized with her, whenever something like that happened to her and whenever she reflected on the worst moments of her life.We follow her for one year of the new school listening to her narration. That gives us great contrast between what she does and what she intends to do. Also, probably that’s why there are so many references to other poplar anime. Hearing her thoughts not always justifies her actions. Although she tries to be popular, she clearly doesn’t want that or really lacks the skills to do so. It’s hard to change one’s way of behaving, I know something about that.Please skip this paragraph if you don’t want the ending spoiled. [SPOILER ALERT]. Ending might not be satisfying for some. We have Tomoko in situation, that could greatly improve her status. Yet, she… panics (running scene is epic by the way). There she goes, back home to her loneliness. So what now? Was it all in vain? I believe her last words will eventually cause her to pay less attention to what people think about her, and that will lead to making some friends and having less pressure. Yay, happy headcannon! [SPOILERS END]In short, I highly recommend watching the anime. Not everyone may like it, but I sure did. It’s great in its own way, and gives a chance to experience something new and different from what other anime have to offer. course, unlike her, I do have friends… I swear!

This is not to say this sort of thing doesn’t exist, just that it’s particularly hard to find. WataMote is an outlier, in how it confronts a legitimate issue and portrays it with utmost honesty, while utilizing comedy as a source of amusement and coping, not to make light of the situation. Through a collection of gags conjured in a fundamentally bleak scenario,  WataMote finds amusement and humor in...a portrayal of anxiety which rivals that of Evangelion. Perhaps one of the worst, cruelest things to be imposed on someone is the feeling of isolation and loneliness. Shyness can look cute on the outside, but the same can be said about an animal trapped in a zoo. Both sheer hilarity and blistering tragedy ensue in Kuroki Tomoko’s cavalcade of mishaps, exploring the multiple facets of her character which speaks to the hearts of those who have had the displeasure of feeling invisible to society.Various monologues, delusions, and fantasies are at play here as we follow Kuroki Tomoko in her quest to become popular. Having almost no social skills whatsoever, much of the action takes place within Tomoko’s own thoughts, from scheming on how to approach a situation to conjuring an ideal fantasy where all her desires are met, sometimes referencing an anime or manga she knows of. Tomoko is genuinely a fun and endearing character to follow, partly thanks to how vividly and creatively her thoughts are presented. Her point of view is depicted in a litany of wacky and comical ways, with each affair being executed in a way that wouldn’t look out of place in a battle shounen; exaggerated and dramatic. To say that WataMote plays out like a battle shounen undersells it however. Unlike many manga adaptations which tend to have uninspired camerawork and lazy implementation of dialogue, WataMote is always exercising creativity in how to present her thoughts. New visual elements are constantly brought to the table so that the experience never grows stale. Inventive visual work, snappy pacing, and Tomoko’s constant narrations work in unison to bring this character to life.Despite depicting these situations in a goofy, comedic light, WataMote presents one of the most accurate depictions of social anxiety I’ve seen in an anime. This portrayal is not limited to simply being nervous or shy in public interactions. Tomoko’s thoughts, perspectives, and attitude all personify that of a socially awkward and anxious high schooler, serving as a basis for her actions. The way her anxiety dictates what she thinks and how she behaves is exploited both comedically and narratively, leading to events which highlight the tragedy of the situation while providing some degree of amusement. All of Tomoko’s delusions and insecurities are welded into a series of gags and humorous moments to exploit the absurdity in her ways of thinking, while eloquently demonstrating what exactly is crippling her in these situations. Feeling nothing but fear and distrust in social situations, Tomoko almost always assumes the worst in people. Internally, she’ll often scoff at or antagonize anyone who isn’t some hot guy she met at a store, and impulsively puts the blame on others for any misfortune that comes up in her day. She’ll desperately gravitate towards any method that is said to make one more popular, attractive, or whichever else, even if it involves purposely getting molested on a train. And yes, she does actually attempt this. The various incidents she pulls herself into are presented in a wacky, hyperbolic manner, to the point where Tomoko comes off as downright maniacal or demented in certain cases. This particular style does a lot to make Tomoko a very endearing character, but she’s made all the more captivating by how she fully encapsulates what social anxiety is really about. It’s a harrowing dilemma to face especially in your high school years, and it’s one that many of us can admit to have had around the same period as Tomoko has. Almost all of us who have had social anxiety can relate to many of Tomoko’s ordeals, which can possibly bring back painful memories of our own. WataMote subjects us to the bleak and dreary realm of social anxiety and the consequences of having it, amplifying the absurdity of the situations that stem from it to soften the blow. In spite of this glossy exterior, WataMote is made fully aware of the situation and gives it the integrity and nuance it deserves, just as a black comedy should.The primary method of which WataMote delivers its humor is by stressing the dichotomy between how Tomoko perceives the world compared to how it actually is. This is the format which pervades the entire show; the reality, often lukewarm and indifferent to Tomoko, is twisted in such a way to abide with her own insecurities. Tomoko constantly deludes herself into believing that she is above everyone else, and it’s portrayed to be rather pitiful, yet still funny and amusing. Consider this scene as an example: on a rainy day, when Tomoko finds that her umbrella is missing, she instinctively assumes it to have been stolen. She then has an internal rage about how she is an innocent victim whose day was ruined by this abominable crime. Then, she stops to realize that her umbrella was just a few feet in another direction. This is a funny moment on its own, but it’s also a perfect example of how Tomoko operates outside the comfort of her own home. When something seemed to be wrong at first, she instinctively assumes it to be another’s wrongdoing, without taking even a second to consider any alternative.Things that seem relatively mundane and trivial to us are made into a much bigger deal than they need to be. This exact way of thinking is what leads Tomoko into numerous awkward situations involving other people, which is exactly what blocks her off from others. Her rationale is purely based on knee-jerk suspicions rather than logic, some of which are understandable to at least some degree, such as worrying about what classmates will think about the sight of you eating alone. Others can be quite outrageous or downright unfathomable, such as the notion that wearing certain underwear makes you friends more easily. Both of these can be attributed to how someone with social anxiety really operates. Tomoko’s antics come in a seemingly endless variety, as new situations arise after another and more inspiration is attained. Because we are given a thorough introspective on what possesses her to take these actions, it’s made easy to gravitate towards Tomoko and understand what she does, as irrational and ludicrous as they are most of the time. The sad truth of the matter is, as over-the-top and balls-to-the-wall as it’s all portrayed to be, it’s conceptually accurate to how some of us behaved in our adolescent years. Both these factors are what effectively put us in her own shoes, making it all the more uncomfortable to watch when these actions actually follow through, there to be witnessed by outsiders. This discomfort is a large part of what makes it funny, yet oddly impactful on a personal level. I for one can admit to have operated along the same lines as Tomoko in my own school years, and I imagine plenty of others are the same way. Whether you have fully grown out of this phase or are still in the process of doing so, laughing at yourself is a good first step towards moving on with your life.This is even the case with her own family as well as her best friend Yuu-chan. Even though they, particularly Yuu-chan, are relatively close to her, they are not exempt from witnessing the crazed antics Tomoko stirs up on a daily basis. Her brother Tomoki serves as a test subject of sorts, as Tomoko uses new bizarre methods of communicating to see how they play out. Tomoki, like everyone else, has no idea what the hell goes on in Tomoko’s mind, and thus wants nothing to do with whatever nonsense she subjects to him. Tomoko’s interactions with her mother go about as smoothly as those with anxious teens who feel as though nobody understands them would expectedly play out with their parents. Yuu-chan, being the only character besides Tomoko’s parents to give her unconditional support and attention, ends up being one of the most likeable characters on offer. Tomoko even still projects herself into Yuu-chan and holds her on the same standards. Yuu-chan’s presence, compared to how she once was, as an attractive, well-endowed specimen with many healthy relationships is an abhorrent sight to Tomoko. What Tomoko feels could be described as a feeling of betrayal, or rather severe envy. Tomoko’s twisted and misguided view on people erects yet another barrier around even her best friend. Luckily for her, most of anything Tomoko would usually do comes with almost no repercussions when around Yuu-chan. Tomoko’s company with Yuu-chan is relatively painless and refreshing compared to that of other people, as Tomoko is rarely wound into such humiliating incidents. In a way, seeing these characters together is somewhat euphoric. Nonetheless, there is still much awkwardness to be be found among their interactions, as Tomoko’s insane ideas run amok even still. Tomoko’s interactions with these characters are very distinct from one other, which makes Tomoko feel more like an actual person and makes each encounter with them very unique. As a result, WataMote is given plenty more sources of comedy at its disposal and makes Tomoko’s moments involving them varied and original.Even with all these shenanigans at play, WataMote doesn’t shy away from providing full, unfiltered attention to Tomoko’s dilemma when it needs to. Whenever Tomoko is legitimately hurt or grief-stricken by what happens, the show seizes to pull any punches at that point. The limelight is positioned squarely on her humiliation and anguish, often laying a somber melody upon the scene; she even sheds tears at some points. These moments might as well be climaxes, as she is in a position where no ounce of delusion can divert her from the crude reality of what she’s led herself into. WataMote understands this disorder which Tomoko is bound by, and knows full well when it is no longer a laughing matter. The absence of comedy during these moments is enough to draw attention to how affected Tomoko really is; yet another factor of what makes her so easy to feel for. Of course, once these moments pass, the proper course of action is not to dwell on those past situations, but to shrug it off, move on, and hope tomorrow will be better. And this is exactly what WataMote does. The moment follows through, the whole arc fades into a somber close, and the cycle begins anew.Although the show’s structure is based around repetition, WataMote is not exempt from providing actual character development. The actions Tomoko takes do in fact affect what she does in future events. Additionally, as the show draws into its later half, Tomoko’s denial lessens while she gradually becomes more accepting of her dilemma. Her life concurrently becomes more bleak and hopeless as a result. This is the point where her actions, while still less than ideal, become significantly more reasonable, as she makes a conscious effort towards amending her newly found flaws. This development comes across very naturally; there’s nothing drastic or sudden about this change. It comes in minimal pieces as Tomoko retains what she has experienced through her mishaps. Of course, she never truly unbounds herself from the self-destructive tendencies we see throughout. As we all know, it’s incredibly easy to fall back to old habits.It’s easy to see that if Tomoko was a person in real life, she would not be a fun person to interact with or be around, but that doesn’t make her struggles any less real. Despite how abrasive and hostile she is portrayed to be overall, Tomoko is a character who is easy to sympathize with, because the full context of her troubles is made very clear. While not exactly universal, experiencing this kind of distress is something very many people can identify with. Because of this, we immediately understand her actions, even if we don’t find them to rational in any sense. Her life is very empty and miserable, affirmed all the more through her constant denial and acts of desperation. We want her to succeed, and thus seeing her get into humiliating situations through her own doing is genuinely an unpleasant experience. It just goes to show how coming out of your shell is never an easy task for anyone. Whatever Tomoko suffers through, we are forced to suffer through with her.This leads into what is perhaps the most common criticism towards WataMote. For many people, WataMote is a very uncomfortable, cringe-inducing experience. I would be one of the first to agree that the show is certainly uncomfortable at many points, but I would also say that it is so for the right reasons. Some say it’s uncomfortable for the reason that Tomoko is unlikeable, which is obviously something I disagree on quite strongly. Others say it’s for the reason that they don’t want to see Tomoko go through these miserable affairs. As mentioned previously, despite how frequently and badly she fucks up, there is change in her character to be found along the way. While not always necessarily positive, it’s still change nonetheless. These small changes show that there is legitimate hope for her. For this reason, it’s made all the more cathartic and heartwarming when Tomoko really does manage to find a fair bit of comfort towards the end of the show.Not only does she reflect nearly every facet of the usual social awkwardness that resides in many high schoolers, she’s also a funny and charming character independent of that. Her antics are unpredictable and she’s endearingly quirky through each passing episode. She is voiced extremely well in the Japanese audio as well as the English dub. Of course, a considerable factor in what makes Tomoko so appealing to many is her visual design itself. Her small stature and baggy, half-open eyes make her look rather cute with an element of mischief, which is perfect for the character. The way she constantly and drastically changes into different expressions is a huge factor in what makes this character so funny and loveable through each of her schemes and shenanigans.Despite how commendable the design of Tomoko really is, it’s a shame that her design is the only memorable one in the entire show. Almost every other character is rendered to a bland default anime design with very little distinguishing qualities. This is excusable for background characters, but the more important characters don’t fare much better. Yuu-chan’s design has only her yellow hair and well-endowed physique to make her stand out from the rest. Even Tomoko’s own family suffers from a lack of inspiration in their design. It’s unfortunate that this is how it turned out to be, but it could also just further affirm how remarkable the design of Tomoko really is.Apart from that, the visual department on the whole is something to be admired. The backgrounds are bold and daring, which makes the scenery very eye-catching and vibrant. The animation is very fluid, especially when it really needs to be. Never did I feel as though the animation quality was ever lacking through any of my viewing experiences. Perhaps the most unique and notable aspect of the visuals is how the lens flares are designed. Light sources like the sun always produce flares that take the form of angular shapes. There isn’t a particular rhyme or reason for this design choice, but rather it serves to further enforce the cartoony nature, which is perfectly welcome in my book.So when you think of “self-insertion” in anime, there’s a good chance that conjures up images of an ideal fantasy world in which the protagonist is blessed with numerous desires and conflict is trivialized; basically your typical harem or isekai. WataMote is self-insert in a different way, where you connect Tomoko’s various mishaps to that of your own. Once this happens, WataMote provides an experience few other anime could hope to emulate. It’s hellbent on reaching that one specific audience it’s directed towards, and does so marvelously. The “thorned rose” analogy is perhaps more applicable here than it is with any other show in recent memory. It is shame however that WataMote covers only a portion of its source material, meaning that an ideal conclusion for Tomoko isn’t present here. This leaves the only hope of getting one to the manga itself, or perhaps a possible anime sequel. Regardless of this shortcoming, I for one am glad to have laughed, cried, cringed, and cheered through Tomoko’s endeavors. a portrayal of anxiety which rivals that of Evangelion. Perhaps one of the worst, cruelest things to be imposed on someone is the feeling of isolation and loneliness. Shyness can look cute on the outside, but the same can be said about an animal trapped in a zoo.

When something seemed to be wrong at first, she instinctively assumes it to be another’s wrongdoing, without taking even a second to consider any alternative.Things that seem relatively mundane and trivial to us are made into a much bigger deal than they need to be. This exact way of thinking is what leads Tomoko into numerous awkward situations involving other people, which is exactly what blocks her off from others. Her rationale is purely based on knee-jerk suspicions rather than logic, some of which are understandable to at least some degree, such as worrying about what classmates will think about the sight of you eating alone. Others can be quite outrageous or downright unfathomable, such as the notion that wearing certain underwear makes you friends more easily. Both of these can be attributed to how someone with social anxiety really operates. Tomoko’s antics come in a seemingly endless variety, as new situations arise after another and more inspiration is attained. Because we are given a thorough introspective on what possesses her to take these actions, it’s made easy to gravitate towards Tomoko and understand what she does, as irrational and ludicrous as they are most of the time. The sad truth of the matter is, as over-the-top and balls-to-the-wall as it’s all portrayed to be, it’s conceptually accurate to how some of us behaved in our adolescent years. Both these factors are what effectively put us in her own shoes, making it all the more uncomfortable to watch when these actions actually follow through, there to be witnessed by outsiders. This discomfort is a large part of what makes it funny, yet oddly impactful on a personal level. I for one can admit to have operated along the same lines as Tomoko in my own school years, and I imagine plenty of others are the same way. Whether you have fully grown out of this phase or are still in the process of doing so, laughing at yourself is a good first step towards moving on with your life.This is even the case with her own family as well as her best friend Yuu-chan. Even though they, particularly Yuu-chan, are relatively close to her, they are not exempt from witnessing the crazed antics Tomoko stirs up on a daily basis. Her brother Tomoki serves as a test subject of sorts, as Tomoko uses new bizarre methods of communicating to see how they play out. Tomoki, like everyone else, has no idea what the hell goes on in Tomoko’s mind, and thus wants nothing to do with whatever nonsense she subjects to him. Tomoko’s interactions with her mother go about as smoothly as those with anxious teens who feel as though nobody understands them would expectedly play out with their parents. Yuu-chan, being the only character besides Tomoko’s parents to give her unconditional support and attention, ends up being one of the most likeable characters on offer. Tomoko even still projects herself into Yuu-chan and holds her on the same standards. Yuu-chan’s presence, compared to how she once was, as an attractive, well-endowed specimen with many healthy relationships is an abhorrent sight to Tomoko. What Tomoko feels could be described as a feeling of betrayal, or rather severe envy. Tomoko’s twisted and misguided view on people erects yet another barrier around even her best friend. Luckily for her, most of anything Tomoko would usually do comes with almost no repercussions when around Yuu-chan. Tomoko’s company with Yuu-chan is relatively painless and refreshing compared to that of other people, as Tomoko is rarely wound into such humiliating incidents. In a way, seeing these characters together is somewhat euphoric. Nonetheless, there is still much awkwardness to be be found among their interactions, as Tomoko’s insane ideas run amok even still. Tomoko’s interactions with these characters are very distinct from one other, which makes Tomoko feel more like an actual person and makes each encounter with them very unique. As a result, WataMote is given plenty more sources of comedy at its disposal and makes Tomoko’s moments involving them varied and original.Even with all these shenanigans at play, WataMote doesn’t shy away from providing full, unfiltered attention to Tomoko’s dilemma when it needs to. Whenever Tomoko is legitimately hurt or grief-stricken by what happens, the show seizes to pull any punches at that point. The limelight is positioned squarely on her humiliation and anguish, often laying a somber melody upon the scene; she even sheds tears at some points. These moments might as well be climaxes, as she is in a position where no ounce of delusion can divert her from the crude reality of what she’s led herself into. WataMote understands this disorder which Tomoko is bound by, and knows full well when it is no longer a laughing matter. The absence of comedy during these moments is enough to draw attention to how affected Tomoko really is; yet another factor of what makes her so easy to feel for. Of course, once these moments pass, the proper course of action is not to dwell on those past situations, but to shrug it off, move on, and hope tomorrow will be better. And this is exactly what WataMote does. The moment follows through, the whole arc fades into a somber close, and the cycle begins anew.Although the show’s structure is based around repetition, WataMote is not exempt from providing actual character development. The actions Tomoko takes do in fact affect what she does in future events. Additionally, as the show draws into its later half, Tomoko’s denial lessens while she gradually becomes more accepting of her dilemma. Her life concurrently becomes more bleak and hopeless as a result. This is the point where her actions, while still less than ideal, become significantly more reasonable, as she makes a conscious effort towards amending her newly found flaws. This development comes across very naturally; there’s nothing drastic or sudden about this change. It comes in minimal pieces as Tomoko retains what she has experienced through her mishaps. Of course, she never truly unbounds herself from the self-destructive tendencies we see throughout. As we all know, it’s incredibly easy to fall back to old habits.It’s easy to see that if Tomoko was a person in real life, she would not be a fun person to interact with or be around, but that doesn’t make her struggles any less real. Despite how abrasive and hostile she is portrayed to be overall, Tomoko is a character who is easy to sympathize with, because the full context of her troubles is made very clear. While not exactly universal, experiencing this kind of distress is something very many people can identify with. Because of this, we immediately understand her actions, even if we don’t find them to rational in any sense. Her life is very empty and miserable, affirmed all the more through her constant denial and acts of desperation. We want her to succeed, and thus seeing her get into humiliating situations through her own doing is genuinely an unpleasant experience. It just goes to show how coming out of your shell is never an easy task for anyone. Whatever Tomoko suffers through, we are forced to suffer through with her.This leads into what is perhaps the most common criticism towards WataMote. For many people, WataMote is a very uncomfortable, cringe-inducing experience. I would be one of the first to agree that the show is certainly uncomfortable at many points, but I would also say that it is so for the right reasons. Some say it’s uncomfortable for the reason that Tomoko is unlikeable, which is obviously something I disagree on quite strongly. Others say it’s for the reason that they don’t want to see Tomoko go through these miserable affairs. As mentioned previously, despite how frequently and badly she fucks up, there is change in her character to be found along the way. While not always necessarily positive, it’s still change nonetheless. These small changes show that there is legitimate hope for her. For this reason, it’s made all the more cathartic and heartwarming when Tomoko really does manage to find a fair bit of comfort towards the end of the show.Not only does she reflect nearly every facet of the usual social awkwardness that resides in many high schoolers, she’s also a funny and charming character independent of that. Her antics are unpredictable and she’s endearingly quirky through each passing episode. She is voiced extremely well in the Japanese audio as well as the English dub. Of course, a considerable factor in what makes Tomoko so appealing to many is her visual design itself. Her small stature and baggy, half-open eyes make her look rather cute with an element of mischief, which is perfect for the character. The way she constantly and drastically changes into different expressions is a huge factor in what makes this character so funny and loveable through each of her schemes and shenanigans.Despite how commendable the design of Tomoko really is, it’s a shame that her design is the only memorable one in the entire show. Almost every other character is rendered to a bland default anime design with very little distinguishing qualities. This is excusable for background characters, but the more important characters don’t fare much better. Yuu-chan’s design has only her yellow hair and well-endowed physique to make her stand out from the rest. Even Tomoko’s own family suffers from a lack of inspiration in their design. It’s unfortunate that this is how it turned out to be, but it could also just further affirm how remarkable the design of Tomoko really is.Apart from that, the visual department on the whole is something to be admired. The backgrounds are bold and daring, which makes the scenery very eye-catching and vibrant. The animation is very fluid, especially when it really needs to be. Never did I feel as though the animation quality was ever lacking through any of my viewing experiences. Perhaps the most unique and notable aspect of the visuals is how the lens flares are designed. Light sources like the sun always produce flares that take the form of angular shapes. There isn’t a particular rhyme or reason for this design choice, but rather it serves to further enforce the cartoony nature, which is perfectly welcome in my book.So when you think of “self-insertion” in anime, there’s a good chance that conjures up images of an ideal fantasy world in which the protagonist is blessed with numerous desires and conflict is trivialized; basically your typical harem or isekai. WataMote is self-insert in a different way, where you connect Tomoko’s various mishaps to that of your own. Once this happens, WataMote provides an experience few other anime could hope to emulate. It’s hellbent on reaching that one specific audience it’s directed towards, and does so marvelously. The “thorned rose” analogy is perhaps more applicable here than it is with any other show in recent memory. It is shame however that WataMote covers only a portion of its source material, meaning that an ideal conclusion for Tomoko isn’t present here. This leaves the only hope of getting one to the manga itself, or perhaps a possible anime sequel. Regardless of this shortcoming, I for one am glad to have laughed, cried, cringed, and cheered through Tomoko’s endeavors.', 'The opening is fascinating to watch (even if the \'music\' is terrible), the closing also good and a bit catchy. Izumi Kitta delivers an excellent performance, ranging from low sarcasm to deep despair to girly glee. The many faces of Kuroki and the animation mean that despite being almost a 12-episode long monologue, we don\'t get bored watching. That aside._Watamote_ is one of the most painful anime I have ever watched, up there with _End of Evangelion_. I was expecting something not so much in the vein of the lighthearted _Genshiken_ or _Tatami Galaxy_, but the fairly dark _Welcome to the N.H.K.!_ and I got...that, in spades, without the slightest hope of redemption, turned up to the max.Anxiety about social interactions is common. And it\'s amusing - lots of great gags are based on misunderstandings, overthinking things, worries which turn out to be groundless, and revelations of things better kept secret. _Watamote_ has all that, in every episode. And it has plenty of irony: I particularly enjoyed, when I was still watching episode 1 and didn\'t realize what I was in for, Kuroki\'s bookstore line  ""The people here are all way worse than me. Feels good to be here."" Yeah, that really sums up a lot of nerds\' feelings sometimes at safe places like conventions, doesn\'t it? It\'s amusing for being ironic on Kuroki as it\'s immediately subverted, but the viewer probably can recognize that the line and irony apply to themselves a little bit as well.The problem is... it all goes too far. Not too long ago, I was corresponding with what I now suspect to have been a mentally ill person, and I deliberately mocked their claims and led them on to see what they\'d say (http://www.gwern.net/Blackmail); it occurred to me partway that they might be mentally ill, but I dismissed it as my usual arrogance, until a vaguely increasing sense of unease and sense of guilt led me to tone things down. In retrospect, I did not handle the incident too well. I began to feel the same way in episode 3: that I was enjoying myself at the expense of someone who I should not be enjoying myself at the expense of, that I was being shown the humiliation and mockery of someone deeply disabled and mentally ill. In fact, look up the DSM-5\'s criteria for \'social anxiety disorder\': A-G match perfectly except *perhaps* C (""The person recognizes that this fear is unreasonable or excessive.""). You wouldn\'t watch a film about mocking the blind, or the deaf, or playing pranks on paraplegics, or about tying cans to a cat\'s tail; you wouldn\'t enjoy an anime focused on the wacky doings of a mentally retarded person - *you\'d feel bad about yourself*. I feel bad about watching _Watamote_. Kimochi warui, dudes. I felt mental pain watching many episodes. I had to pause scenes, or just stop episodes for that day, or play them on 2x to force my way through the chagrin and embarrassment.Kuroki is, besides a sick character who you want to see get treatment, not a nice person, to put it mildly. She has a serious sadistic streak, massively projects negative traits, is self-centered and entitled, abusive of others, and resents the slightest justified demand on her. It\'s not pleasant watching her, at all. A character without redeeming aspects is a hard sell as a protagonist, and I\'d probably appreciate such a non-moe female character if I could get over everything else. But actually, it\'s probably better for the viewer\'s peace of mind to not sympathasize with Kuroki (although it\'s hard given that we spend the entire series inside her head, and we all remember similar embarrassing experiences as those Kuroki endures, even if ours were much tamer).Worse are the people around her. It seems initially cute when her mother walks in on her doing something extremely awkward and pretends it doesn\'t exist, or when her father finds her asleep having apparently masturbated and just calmly puts her to bed. It gets a lot less cute when you begin to notice that Kuroki\'s social anxiety is pathological, longstanding, and notice that almost the only time Kuroki\'s mother disciplines her is when Kuroki threatens her image when her sister is coming over with Kuroki\'s cousin, and when she needs some work done. My mental image of the mother as tolerating Kuroki\'s phase and giving her space to work out her issues without pressuring her suddenly flips into a different concern: Japanese society is, I am told, not very good at dealing with mental illness and puts a stigma and taboo on acknowledging any issues or seeking treatment. _Watamote_ is generally a very realistic show (eg all the references I noticed were to real stuff: a ton of _Haruhi_ references, _Detective Conan_, _Another_, _K-On!_, Nico Nico Douga, _Nadia_, McDonald\'s, etc), including no fantastical materials, minimal coincidences, an unattractive protagonist who isn\'t Hollywood Homely (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely)...  What ever shows that Kuroki\'s parents care much about her at all, and aren\'t just protecting their social image and reputation and doing their best to pretend Kuroki has no problems? For that matter, what about her classmates? The show seems to go out of its way to depict all her classmates as good nice people who even are bothered by killing a cockroach, and certainly are not bullying or mistreating Kuroki... yet, she never speaks to anyone. Isn\'t that going a little beyond their description ""Kuroki-san is quiet""? Quiet, certainly, but never talking to anyone, never eating lunch with anyone, never participating in anything... It\'s not like they don\'t have plenty of opportunity to notice. The council president starts to suspect the problem after just 2 or 3 brief encounters with Kuroki, and her cousin strongly suspects after a day or two. The class could know if it wants to. We might initially place our hope in the teachers, since the homeroom teacher interacts a little bit with Kuroki early on, but it never goes beyond that. Why only ever tell her to be careful on the way home? You can try talking about more than that! And her best friend Yuu? Completely oblivious. (Or is she? Given that she seems to be consciously playing a role, one wonders.)So. The parents are apparently trying to cover everything up. The classmates and teacher feel they\'re doing enough. The brother takes the brunt of Kuroki\'s abuse and warped cries for help, but it\'s a little much to expect him to handle it all by himself and he does his fair share. Her only friend doesn\'t realize there\'s any problem. Kuroki can\'t help herself; she tries, but it all fails. She tries repeatedly, and it fails, and even her final effort in the last episode to reach the council president fails (and depressingly, she seems to realize there\'s a problem but to think Kuroki is working hard, which is true but sounds like an excuse to forget about the matter, and given the whole overall thrust of _Watamote_, it\'s hopeless to expect anything good to come out of their interactions).Everyone is clueless, disengaged, or covering it up. No one will help, and those who want to, can\'t. There is no sign that Kuroki will ever get better. That things will ever improve. She will forever be trapped in her room, trapped in her fantasies and a sad little girl outside them, unable to develop into anything or have real friends. The pervading sense is a harsh bitter hopelessness. Being resigned to despair is still a form of despair.Overall, I think the ANN review by Theron Martin (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/watamote/episodes-1) does a good job reviewing the series, but I have to disagree with the summation that the tragedy is sufficiently balanced by comedy and that ""occasionally feel like it is just dumping misfortune on Tomoko, but it never goes far enough with this to negate how Tomoko creating her own misfortune makes the series\' title incredibly ironic"".Or the series tags... \'Comedy\'? \'Slice of life\'? \'Morbidly funny\' This is supposed to be funny? I\'m supposed to laugh? You must be shitting me. If this was not intended by the creators to be a pitch-black psychological horror work (at which it succeeds nauseatingly well) almost unrelieved by any humor but that which indicts the viewer for finding it funny - they have much to answer for.> ""Somebody remarked: \'I can tell by my own reaction to it that this book is harmful.\' But let him only wait and perhaps one day he will admit to himself that this same book has done him a great service by bringing out the hidden sickness of his heart and making it visible.""Kimochi warui. that, in spades, without the slightest hope of redemption, turned up to the max.Anxiety about social interactions is common.

Because of this, I was prompted to watch the series to see if I would enjoy it as much as it\'s been glorified. As I watched it, I didn\'t feel humored at all. Watamote\'s reputation covered up its many flaws as an anime.Story: 4/10The plot of Watamote follows Kuroki Tomoko as she enters high school, expecting to be wildly popular among the boys. Of course, this turns out to be far from the truth as she is completely introverted. The show simply proceeds to show...Tomoko\'s sad attempts at becoming a more social person. In order to stay true to the manga, there is no development in the storyline. It\'s merely a series of Tomoko\'s failures in the real world. Now, this should be hilarious and relatable, but I ended up feeling absolutely pitiful by the end of it. No one should be that introverted and lonely. While there probably is some out there that can connect to her, I barely could. Some moments of the show I laughed at Tomoko\'s poor decisions, but most of the time I felt uncomfortable. It ended up leaving a negative impression on me.Art: 9/10This is probably one of the factors of the show that greatly appealed to me. The animators didn\'t skimp out and their price was nicely paid. Watamote\'s art is filled with ambience and bright colors. The character and setting designs are lovely to look at, even though most of the background characters were just gray bodies. The animation was high quality and nicely done.Sound: 8/10The sounds of Watamote are above average. Some fields of it were definitely great while others felt bland to me. The voice actress for Tomoko did a fantastic job of conveying her personality. It really sounded like an introverted teenage girl, especially during scenes where Tomoko had to interact with other people. The opening sequence is pretty... unique compared to other opening songs and I usually skip it, save for one episode where the transition from anime to opening song was AMAZING. The ending sequence is sung by Tomoko\'s voice actress and pretty cute, but not good enough for me to get hooked on. Songs and voices together, Watamore has an above average sound.Characters: 7/10While the plot for Watamote was pretty stagnant, I gotta say, the characters are pretty interesting. Tomoko has a lot of personality as a person. Even though she\'s still socially awkward and strange, she brings a lot of humor to the show. Her wild ideas and fantasies end up creating the craziest situations. It\'s a deal breaker that she gets absolutely no development, but she\'s filled with great interest as a main character. A couple of the side characters were fun as well, especially Tomoko\'s non-empathetic younger brother, Tomoki, who has to sit through hearing about Tomoko\'s sad life. Despite the zero-development, the characters are somewhat enjoyable, but not enough to be lovable.Enjoyment: 5/10At first, Watamote was interesting, but as the episodes went on, my feelings for the show went from interested to pitiful. I couldn\'t help but feel extremely uncomfortable while watching Tomoko fantasizing about being popular while being totally introverted. At the end of each episode, I felt sorry for her instead of feeling entertained. I could not enjoy it all after the second half. Watamote should have been filled with dark humor, but ended up filling me with uncomfort.Overall: 6/10Watamote honestly could have been really good. The manga is hilarious, but the adaptation was not. While the characters and animation are great, the upsetting blatant storyline and ""humor"" keep me from liking it as much as other people do.

It is, no one denies that fact. As the years go on and one gets closer to senior year, the number of assignments and homework starts to pile up. Some may dismiss all of this and just live wildly. Others might not (like me)  and do in fact do their homework like a good boy or girl (Santa gave me presents last year because of that)....High school is not a popularity contest, popularity was something that you thought was super important in middle school, but gradually lost importance as the years rolled by. You enter high school with your group of friends that you made in middle school and everything is nice and dandy, right?Well, maybe not for everybody. And certainly not for Tomoko Kuroki, our main protagonist. Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (No Matter How I Look at It, It’s You Guys' Fault I’m Not Popular!), or WataMote for short, is your not so generic slice-of-life anime featuring our main female protagonist Tomoko Kuroki as she struggles with her high school life. But, as with most high school animes, she doesn't struggle with class since teachers in Japan are mythical creatures, but instead with her underwhelming popularity and her overwhelming desire to increase her nonexistent popularity. Sounds simple right?A socially awkward person since a young age, Tomoko seeks to rectify her lack of friends upon entering high school. She has spent countless hours playing otome games in order to learn the mystical and sublime art of talking to men. However, two months into high school and Tomoko is as lonely as ever. Without a clue as to what is failing due to her belief that high school makes her instantly popular, Tomoko, who by the way has a very positive image about the way she looks (meaning to say that she thinks she's a total hottie), takes a good long look at the mirror for the first time in who knows how many years, only to find the exact same opposite of what she thought of herself.This is where WataMote kicks off and generally what drives the series through twelve very painful to watch episodes as Tomoko tries her best at becoming popular. Why is it painful, you ask? Let me give you what I believe to be the most cringe worthy moment of the entire anime. After entering a crowded train, Tomoko feels something rubbing up against her. She starts feeling nervous and scared, believing it is a molester. The thing rubbing her then goes farther down, and Tomoko starts fearing for her life. As the train arrives to its next stop, Tomoko goes out running, only to be stuck by this thing rubbing against her and unable to move with dozens of people watching. We then hear a voice of a young girl apologizing that her naginata equipment got stuck on Tomoko. After experiencing a tremendous amount of public embarrassment, Tomoko breaks free and goes on with her life as usual.WataMote carries a comedy tag to it, but to say that this show is comedy would be kind of an insult. I actually felt sorry for her on many occasions, like on episode three when her umbrella breaks and she gets stuck taking shelter with two boys. After making a run for the bathroom, she return to the shelter only to find the boys gone and decides to take a nap to wait out the rain. When she wakes up (still raining), she finds a new umbrella beside her and goes on home, silently wishing  that , for once, a boy would do something nice for her, all the while not noticing that it was these same two boys who bought that umbrella for her. It's really disheartening and it pains me to watch at times because of scenes like this one.Getting back to the topic at hand, WataMote has in total twelve episodes. The story is episodic in nature with the over arching story being, as said above, Tomoko's resolve to become popular. It's a story about character development and you really want to see her get some friends, but at the end of the day you realize that the character development is almost nonexistent. WataMote just doesn't end, it basically tells you to deal with it or just go and read the manga. I know its twelve episodes long, but a little closure for our main character would have been much appreciated.As for characters, there's a few that caught my attention. First off is, of course, Tomoko. A fifteen year old recluse that borders into being a deranged person, craving for acceptance. With heavy bags under her eyes, she is supposed to symbolize many shut ins that exist nowadays. I've already said enough about her for you to have a clear picture of her, so let's just move on.Tomoki is Tomoko's younger brother. A talented soccer player, Tomoki is what Tomoko isn't: popular. He often questions Tomoko's sanity and weird behavior and is often annoyed by her personality. Tomoko usually goes to him for advice on how to talk to men seeing as he is the only male character in the series she can talk to normally.Yu Naruse is Tomoko's best friend from middle school. No wait, she's her only friend from middle school. She first appears in episode two having invited Tomoko to hang out, given that she went to a different high school than Tomoko. A recluse at heart, Yu actually managed to garner popularity by changing her appearance, ranging from dying her hair to breast implants. Tomoko is at first afraid that she isn't the same Yu from middle school, but soon finds out that she still enjoys everything that she did in middle school, such as watching anime, reading manga and playing video games. As such, she like Tomoki is what Tomoko isn't: popular.On the topic for animation nothing to say here really. Its good, but nothing that stands out. The studio that worked on WataMote is studio Silver Link, known for their work in Kokoro Connect. The director for WataMote is none other than Shin Oonuma, known for his role as director in shows such as ef: A Tale of Melodies/Memories and Kokoro Connect. Bottom line, it gets the job done, but its nothing spectacular.Similarly, the soundtrack for WataMote was nothing amazing. It just sounds like any other slice of life anime out there and none of the tracks stand out except for the opening. Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! by Konomi Suzuki and Kiba of Akiba is the opening that spans across all twelve episodes of the series. This opening is, in my most humble opinion, a true masterpiece. A song filled with heavy metal and angry vocals accompanied by dark grim images of Tomoko in chains symbolizes just how angry and lonely Tomoko is in correlation with the rest of the world. It really shows the main underlying theme of the show which is Tomoko wanting to break free of her social anxiety. Beautiful to watch, one of my favorite openings of all time just because of its connection with the show.The series sports various endings indeed. The main ending theme, Dō Kangaetemo Watashi wa Warukunai, is featured in all but four episodes.  Episodes two and five use Musō Renka and  Yoru no Tobari yo Sayōnara respectively, both performed by Velvet,Kodhy. Episode six uses Natsu Matsuri by Utsu-P & Toka Minatsuki, featuring vocals by Hatsune Miku (yay) while  episode eleven utilizes Sokora no Chaku-Gurumi no Fūsen to Watashi by Velvet,Kodhy.This review has gone long enough so let's wrap it up. I initially started watching WataMote because, from an outsiders perspective, Tomoko looks a bit like a friend of mine. I wanted to watch the show and then show her how Tomoko and her looked alike. But after watching a few episodes, I knew Tomoko and my friend were nothing alike. I honestly cannot comprehend the purpose of this show. Is it a parody on recluse and otakus or just a very mean black comedy show? I don't know and I prefer to leave it that way because it adds a certain charm to it. Speaking of charm, this show contains some scenes that parody other famous animes like Death Note and Ghost in the Shell. See if you can find them all!With all that in mind, it is time for my final verdict.I don't know if I enjoyed WataMote or not. It certainly was disturbing, painful, and sad to watch. Animation is good, but nothing spectacular. The music is meh with the exception of the opening and the character development is, well... meh as well.Overall, I give Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! a final score of 6.2 out of 10.This is my second review here on MAL, so any feedback, as usual, would be very welcome. Have a great day, and you can be on the lookout for my next review.

However Yuu developed more socially and Physically compared to Tomoko. But the interesting thing is Yuu, despite her developments has nobody to talk to about her anime/otaku hobby and this pains her. I\'m flabbergasted the anime did not take the route to expand on that further. Those two characters using eachother to improve themselves on the fields they are weak in would be a great plot device! the same goes for a number of side characters Tomoko encounters in the serie, there are so many chances to include a likable side character she finaly had the courage of talking to into the maincast to help motivate her but it just doesn\'t happen. returning us to square one every single episode.So instead we have to deal with Tomoko going through a nervous breakdown with uncontroled barfing for the umptieth time which just gets boring because it happens to much.I actually got more interested in the side characters as I kept watching.I wanted to know more about Tomoko\'s mom, her brother or her friend Yuu, because we hardly get to see any detail about them.I wanted to like Watamote but it just doesn\'t go anywhere. leaving us with ultimatly nothing more then a timewaster. the world, she hates people and mostly she hates herself for what she is.On one hand I see certain things in Watamote that I\'ve experienced myself up till the age of 15, being the outcast, playing games and watching anime on my own all summer break, having no friends around, living in the fear of not knowing how you need to change your life in a meaning full direction.On The other hand The anime apperantly finds it a form of comedy to NOT have her develop from this depth in her life.

Let's get to the main part:This show made me want to kill myself - and that's a good thing.You see, any emotional impact is great, especially after all these junkfood romcoms and absolutely forgettable shounen garbage.I've finally felt something.WataMote tries to be a comedy, and there are a couple of occasional chuckles here and there but for me, personally, it's a haunting, gloomy and the most depressing drama, for it's a freaking rollercoaster of losing, failing, being completely devastated by awkwardness of circumstances.Man, it's so actually sad I can't wrap my head around...it.Ok, let'me put it like this:If you've been at least once in a situation which Tomoko faces every day - then you would find your yourself on the same wavelength as this most brave and positive girl.Why's that?Well, what makes Tomoko an absolutely amazing and unique human being is that after all these mishappenings she doesn't burst out in tears or go postal (what would any sane and normal person do after what she's been through) - but she keeps on trying, giving life another chance. When I would just hang myself in a closet or put a bullet through my temple - she keeps on waking up, going to school, sitting in a class surrounded by people who don't give a flying f whether she's here or not.And here brother is the meanest and most aggressive brat ever seen - but still she's willing to get along with him!It's depressing, it really is - this show captures the feeling of loneliness and urge to be love so good I'm about to cry like a little girl.But you know, now matter how lost or forgotten you may feel - just think of Tomoko. If she can do it (not right away, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed she'll find what she's looking for) - then you most certainly can too.9/10 and Johnny's seal of approval. it.Ok, let'me put it like this:If you've been at least once in a situation which Tomoko faces every day - then you would find your yourself on the same wavelength as this most brave and positive girl.Why's that?Well, what makes Tomoko an absolutely amazing and unique human being is that after all these mishappenings she doesn't burst out in tears or go postal (what would any sane and normal person do after what she's been through) - but she keeps on trying, giving life another chance.

Of course not everyone...that watches anime was an outcast in school, but quite a few of us that watch anime didn\'t have a great social life in school and it was rather miserable. What watamote tries to do is to poke fun at that subject and make light of it, which is does do, I was laughing my ass off the entire anime (most of it anyways), but what shocked me was how depressing some of it could be. Being a social outcast isn\'t a fun thing, many of us didn\'t choose to be that way (like Tomoko), but we couldn\'t help it, no matter how hard some of us tried we just couldn\'t be popular, but is that a bad thing? Anyways the story in watamote is fairly nonsensical, it\'s basically about all of the crazy shit she gets into throughout her life in high school, which I think works well for the anime. It kind of fits with the whole ""i\'m an outcast"" theme really well. She often gets herself into ridiculous situations that alot of us can relate to and laugh at, but some of them are quite depressing when you start to think about it. It\'s a fairly odd anime to be honest, but Tomoko is a fairly weird girl so it\'s only natural that her story would be weird. All of the jokes and scenarios were really well wrote and seemed very original to me, it feels like something I would write from personal experience, although most of the scenes are exaggerated, but still remained relatable to some degree. I did feel that the ending was on kind of a cliffhanger, but hopefully there will be a second season.Art- The art in watamote isn\'t nothing special, although I will say that alot of the ""costumes"" that tomoko wears is hilarious. it\'s drawn and animated really well and everything flows nicely, nothing too out of the ordinary here.Sound- The sound assets really surprised me in watamote, I practically fell in love with the intro. You can tell when work is put into something, and alot of work was put into watamote, they even made it to where one of the opening scenes blended in perfectly with the intro, which was kind of cool of them. The intro itself really spoke to me, I find that most geeks and outcasts actually listened to death metal/ heavy music and I couldn\'t have wished for a better intro, it\'s also a custom intro, they don\'t use a random song and instead got someone to do something custom for it, which is always appreciated and is rarely seen.Character- The main character in watamote is a fresh character. I can\'t really think of any of any other character that is comparable to Tomoko. She really seems like an individual and is wrote in such a way that you feel for her and don\'t want to laugh at the situation that she gets into, despite it being fucking hilarious. There are often badass characters in anime that are written very well, but alot of the time they\'re not relatable, it\'s hard to make a relatable character, because you have to write them from a certain point, a point that you could only write from out of experience. That\'s why she feels so real, because she is real in a sense. The person that wrote her more than likely went through some of the things she did in the anime, that or the person writing her personally knew someone in the same position as Tomoko. Either way they had personal experience with this kind of thing and that definitely shows because in watamote. She\'s an awesome character that I think more people need to know about.Enjoyment- I really enjoyed watamote, alot more than I thought I would. it was hilarious, entertaining, and surprisingly depressing at some points. I was never left bored and was always interested in what was going to happen to her next. I enjoy things that are different, which is hard to find in anime, but just because it\'s different doesn\'t mean it\'s good, it has to also be good on a fundamental level, and watamote is definitely good on a fundamental level. It\'s only flaw would have to be that only otakus and other outcasts will really understand the subject matter, it\'s not highly accessible to alot of people. For me personally it\'s a 8/10 because it does so many things right in so many places and doesn\'t really mess up much in other places, although I can also see how some people would dislike, or even hate it.Overall- Overall I loved watamote, alot more than I though i would actually. It was a really enjoyable and well though out anime that felt realistic to a degree despite being exaggerated in some areas. it threw me some curveballs in the sense that it was more depressing than I though it would be, I was expecting it to be all comedy, but I felt myself being depressed sometimes as well, which made me have a deeper attachment to the character and make me like her ever more. I would highly reccomend this to anyone that has ever been an outcast in their life and had a hard school life, it might help you get over some of that through comedy and you might even have a good time with it. If you however haven\'t been in that position then you might have a hard time understanding the main character and you might not like it because of that, either way it\'s a fundamentally well written anime and doesn\'t to be as low ranked as it is in my opinion. that watches anime was an outcast in school, but quite a few of us that watch anime didn\'t have a great social life in school and it was rather miserable. What watamote tries to do is to poke fun at that subject and make light of it, which is does do, I was laughing my ass off the entire anime (most of it anyways), but what shocked me was how depressing some of it could be. Being a social outcast isn\'t a fun thing, many of us didn\'t choose to be that way (like Tomoko), but we couldn\'t help it, no matter how hard some of us tried we just couldn\'t be popular, but is that a bad thing? Anyways the story in watamote is fairly nonsensical, it\'s basically about all of the crazy shit she gets into throughout her life in high school, which I think works well for the anime. It kind of fits with the whole ""i\'m an outcast"" theme really well. She often gets herself into ridiculous situations that alot of us can relate to and laugh at, but some of them are quite depressing when you start to think about it. It\'s a fairly odd anime to be honest, but Tomoko is a fairly weird girl so it\'s only natural that her story would be weird. All of the jokes and scenarios were really well wrote and seemed very original to me, it feels like something I would write from personal experience, although most of the scenes are exaggerated, but still remained relatable to some degree. I did feel that the ending was on kind of a cliffhanger, but hopefully there will be a second season.Art- The art in watamote isn\'t nothing special, although I will say that alot of the ""costumes"" that tomoko wears is hilarious. it\'s drawn and animated really well and everything flows nicely, nothing too out of the ordinary here.Sound- The sound assets really surprised me in watamote, I practically fell in love with the intro. You can tell when work is put into something, and alot of work was put into watamote, they even made it to where one of the opening scenes blended in perfectly with the intro, which was kind of cool of them. The intro itself really spoke to me, I find that most geeks and outcasts actually listened to death metal/ heavy music and I couldn\'t have wished for a better intro, it\'s also a custom intro, they don\'t use a random song and instead got someone to do something custom for it, which is always appreciated and is rarely seen.Character- The main character in watamote is a fresh character. I can\'t really think of any of any other character that is comparable to Tomoko. She really seems like an individual and is wrote in such a way that you feel for her and don\'t want to laugh at the situation that she gets into, despite it being fucking hilarious. There are often badass characters in anime that are written very well, but alot of the time they\'re not relatable, it\'s hard to make a relatable character, because you have to write them from a certain point, a point that you could only write from out of experience. That\'s why she feels so real, because she is real in a sense. The person that wrote her more than likely went through some of the things she did in the anime, that or the person writing her personally knew someone in the same position as Tomoko. Either way they had personal experience with this kind of thing and that definitely shows because in watamote. She\'s an awesome character that I think more people need to know about.Enjoyment- I really enjoyed watamote, alot more than I thought I would. it was hilarious, entertaining, and surprisingly depressing at some points. I was never left bored and was always interested in what was going to happen to her next. I enjoy things that are different, which is hard to find in anime, but just because it\'s different doesn\'t mean it\'s good, it has to also be good on a fundamental level, and watamote is definitely good on a fundamental level. It\'s only flaw would have to be that only otakus and other outcasts will really understand the subject matter, it\'s not highly accessible to alot of people. For me personally it\'s a 8/10 because it does so many things right in so many places and doesn\'t really mess up much in other places, although I can also see how some people would dislike, or even hate it.Overall- Overall I loved watamote, alot more than I though i would actually.

The story centers at Kuroki Tomoko, a gloomy-looking girl who happens to be an introvert. She\'d be your typical hikkikomori(shut-in) if she doesn\'t go to school, a loner in short. There\'s no certain plot to follow on Wata Mote. The series is purely comedy. We follow Tomoki\'s life as she tries to tread the path on becoming popular, and we laugh as she fails.I\'ve mentioned in my past reviews that music is always crucial in a series(for me of course). Wata Mote has some amusing OST\'s...in it. There were 4 ending themes for it and 1 solid opening theme.  Natsuri Matsuri was done by your most popular ""vocaloid"" Hatsune Miku, I\'ve never been a fan of her, but Natsuri Matsuri is quite good.All of the characters in Wata Mote are normal. Well, not for Tomoki. Would you watch the series if she\'s normal? \'Course not! She\'s one of the gloomiest characters I\'ve ever seen. Some characters were made to look cool and flashy, but for Tomoko? Definitely not the case. They\'ve put total effort into making her an ugly otaku gir(although she can still be cute at times, even though its only in her delusions.). Her fantasies(delusions) could be easily turned into their own series. The attention and detail they put on it are fantastic. But her optimism is on the highest level. If all this things happened to me? Heck, I wouldn\'t think twice slitting my neck to end it all. Two of the most popular seiyuus are here too, even though they\'re just supporting acts. Its Kugimiya Rie(who didn\'t have much airtime T.T) and Hanazawa Kana.Even though watamote is your ""weird"" type of series, it can be pretty funny and some few scenes were quite actually heartfelt. Aren\'t the weird types always get the masses? Although some might raise their eyebrows on watamote, I don\'t care. S\'long as I enjoy a series and it pleases me? I don\'t give a shit if someone call what I watch shit. I\'ve long accepted the fact ""you can never please everyone."".Of course this really can\'t happen in real life, but similar events like this did happen in someone\'s life. Bottomline is, watamote is centered to make its viewers laugh. If you didn\'t laugh after watching a couple of episodes, I suggest you drop it. It means you don\'t like its humor, its ok, you can hate its producers and creators. Its not like they give a shit about every one of their viewers. But really, after watching a couple of episodes of Wata Mote and it didn\'t even make any sense to you, drop it. Or worse, add an insult if your friend asks you about it. Viewer\'s discretion is totally adviced on watching watamote. You\'ll be surprised how powerful Tomoki\'s delusions are. Its definitely not for the faint-hearted, but extremely funny(for my \'effin self).And for me, watamote really shows how a mind of a loner can be. They\'d have the weirdest fantasies you could ever imagine. Shows how frail the human mind is. And it really shows that being alone is not cool? So for the kids out there who wants to be alone and thinks that being one is cool. Bullshit. I\'ve experienced being an introvert when I was a kid, trust me, its not even one bit cool. Being left alone while everyone is having fun is not cool, at all. My mom had to consult a psychotherapist just to cure me. And now, I\'m proud to say that I have friends, even though most of them are ""internet friends"". Well, everyone has their own pace, some guys really are meant to be alone, and some guys are perfect in a group. Its for you to know which group you belong. \'Kay, let\'s end my review here, before I retell my whole life.(Overall Score : 8) in it. There were 4 ending themes for it and 1 solid opening theme.

What makes this anime particularly fun to watch is the mindset of Tomoko, which is very interesting. But I guess these kind of people DO ACTUALLY exist in real life. If I ever encounter one, I would like to be their friend(Seriously). Get to the PROS and CONS, now!PROS:+ Cute and unique protagonist(Tomoko kuroki is said to look ugly...really? She looks...darn CUTE to me. While she does not look anything unique, but her ""mindset"" or the way she thinks/her fantasies/her reactions can be fun to follow.)+ Creative jokes which are geniunely hilarious (I\'ve lost count the number of times I laughed while watching this...)+ Epic opening and a cute ending song(an unexpected rocking opening accompanied by a cutely themed ending are pleasant to hear)+ Rewatch factor is medium-high(This is probably only for me...but at one point, I think I would rewatch this, just for the funny scenes)+ Take a drink, some snacks and chill(This is the type of anime that you should sit down and relax and don\'t require so much brainpower to think. Just Chilllll...)CONS:- Typical slice of life(nothing fancy, just your everyday life of a teenager)- Latter half gets very dull. (While it was genuninely funny earlier, but latter half gets unfunny and quite lame.)- Supporting cast are meh.(Tomoko kuroki is awesome, but supporting cast are boring. The LOL thing is, Tomoko\'s brother also have the dark eye patches...)Conclusion: Watamote is a particularly fun anime to watch. Unique protagonist, some cool tracks to listen to, funny jokes but then got onto the FAIL side on the latter half. But even with all those flaws, it was worth spending my time on it and may be worthwhile to you(the reader) as well. darn CUTE to me.

Now, the anime finished so I edited my review.Story: 6/10The story is very simple, like any comedy anime, but this plot is nearer to reality because in real life we find similar cases where girls want to be popular. However, the first three episodes were fine, a little exaggerated but enjoyable, funny and easy to relate to. I didn't like the twist from episode 4 to episode 9; Tomoko goes from being a girl who wants friends, to a pervert. She also goes through more misfortunes and the anime becomes drama-like. What...I also dislike is that somehow they make the other girls of the anime seem like uptown girls (or very feminine girls) and Tomoko as the only abnormal - that, was too exaggerated. Suddenly, in episode 10 Tomoko is no longer a pervert and the story returns at its initial point but without the comedy in episodes 1-3.It would have been great to explain something about Tomoko's relationships with her family (not just with her brother), and could give a good reason as to why the character is shy when conversing - that way, it would be easier to identify with the character as well as the story.Art: 6/10Well, I don't usually focus on art, except when changes from the manga are remarkable. I think they improved Tomoko's design. In the manga she looks misshapen, so anime style looks better. The only thing I disliked is the way her head was shaped and the fact that she's short compared to everyone else. Tomoki's design looks like Oreki's (from Hyouka) and Hachiman's (from Yahari Seishun). A cool combination of the two.I have noticed that in the first and last episodes some characters are faceless, and Tomoko's classmates look too simple and similar to each other. It isn't annoying but, in this case with only few characters developed, I expected more.Characters... well, character: 4/10.In the first three episodes Tomoko is shy, very shy, and clumsy, but still tolerable. However, in fourth episode twist she becomes an unpleasant character. She's still clumsy, shyer than before and a hateful pervert all the time and. Tomoko comes up with something sillier every time. I couldn't understand her... If she wanted friends she should have done a little effort to be able to have a proper conversation and think about what she says rather than doing no effort at all, since I didn't see any. Some of Tomoki's features had the potential to make a cool character but, they were wasted so, he finished as a filling character. Tomoko's best friend... Well meh, I don't like her because she has nothing special but I don't dislike her either. It would have been great if these two characters developed because it's too difficult make a cool and promising story with only one character developed. And with a character like Tomoko it's more difficult.Enjoyment: 6/10.Although this anime is entertaining, Tomoko's misadventures are enjoyable, but the detail in episode 8 onwards isn't entertaining. I wish Tomoko had done better actions to make friends, like maybe look for other type of help? Or something that a normal antisocial person would do if they wanted to become social. It would make the anime more realistic and MAYBE more entertaining.Then, the ending was too ordinary, I expected funnier stuff :/. To finish this review, I only recommend this anime if wish to remove boredom. If you're looking for a realistic story of a person without a social life, you won't find that in this anime. I also recommend to see it bit by bit, might be boring to watch all episodes in one day.

But it is not bad.The anime is talking about a lonely high school girl because of her severe social weakness. This girl spends every day of her life trying to become a popular and beloved girl and to have friends and boyfriend. Unfortunately, she cannot become so no matter how she tries, because she has no experience. She always has embarrassing situations that make you feel sad for her and you desperately want her to overcome the obstacles she faces.The idea of \u200b\u200banime is unique. Because it does not want to make you enjoy it, but wants to make...you hate everything that happens in it for that girl. As it does nothing for her favor, but putting her in situations that make her hate her life and herself more than before. All this anime wants to do is make you sympathize with her by giving you an absolutely uncomfortable feeling.The big problem with this anime is that it never develops the character of the girl. it does not want to address the problem she suffers from, rather it wants to destroy her in a more correct sense. I hated this a lot, to be honest. It would have been wonderful if it had focused seriously on the bottom, as I said before, this idea is unique. It just needed to be done in a good way. This is a big flaw I know, but since I am attached to the girl, I cannot rate it based on my enjoyment.Let's talk about the girl's family. This girl has her parents and a little younger brother. No one in that house is taking care of her or even knows about the problems she is experiencing. They do not treat her badly, no, but to not care about your daughter and not knowing anything about her is a fatal mistake many parents make. I think her parents think of her as perverted or something. As for her brother, he does not give a shit. Although the anime did not mention this, for me, her family's lack of interest in her is the main reason for what she suffers from. This may be considered a personal opinion, but we all know how the family affects its children. Either positive or negative. As for friends, there is that girl named Yuu who was studying with her in middle school. This girl has appeared about three times I think. In fact, I do not consider this girl a friend of her, because she does not know much about her and little meets her. She spends most of her time with her high school friends. This character exists only to make Tomoko jealous(she doesn't really want to make her feel like that) and cause the anime wants to show us that Tomoki is a lonely girl who has nothing special in her.  So Tomoko has no friends. Although a little girl showed up once, who is the daughter of her mother's friend and who respects her a lot. But in that episode in which this girl appeared, she learned that her big sister (she calls Tomoko big sis) actually needs help and decided that she will do what she can to help her but she disappeared and did not appear after that.The majority may consider this anime a comic, but to me, it is not. Because it is only trying to mock social patients and make them a fool as if they were the ones who chose to be like that. For people who have or suffer from the same problem or even people who have good hearts, they will understand the concept of this anime. As for people who are not, they will think that it is stupid. But I hope you see it carefully and put yourself in the shoes of this girl because there are a lot of people that society does not care about and always blame on them even though they actually should care. We humans cannot reach a better place if we do not help each other. you hate everything that happens in it for that girl.

The anime just felt too awkward to understand and I had been lead to think that the anime was funny. The problem might be more my tastes, but the anime itself is a bit painful at times.The anime follows the life of High School girl Kuroki Tomoko, who I can probably sum up with one line from her brother, ""is she stupid?"" It\'s quite frustrating to watch the things that she does in an attempt to make herself more popular.

While at times Watashi can be rather amusing with the situations Tomoko gets herself into (eg. her job in a corporate cake making factory), other times the show in my opinion tries too hard and occasionally the jokes become cringe worthy (eg. most of her dreams/imaginations, they go on forever and we all know they won\'t turn out that way). The start of Watashi was very interesting to me and I got a bit addicted to it, but near the end watching the show just felt like a chore. In fact I had to force my self to watch the last few episodes. Nothing appealed to me and it felt like another dull slice of life.-The Ending.""It\'s a comedy do you expect an ending?"" Of course not but I expect some sort of development of ANYTHING, but no. In Watashi the ending was quite literally the start. ""This is a certain girl\'s..

High school in anime appears to be like paradise, in my opinion, where teenagers spend their days having fun and participating in clubs, meeting up with friends, confessing their love to their crush, and so on. That’s why it’s always nice to see that there’s something that doesn’t follow the crowd, (which is quite fitting because of what this anime is about!)  because to introverts like our main character and moi, high school is rubbish!STORYKuroki Tomoko is a quiet...and super awkward girl, who is about to enter high school, where she believes that her life will change for the better; she will be popular, etc. However, due to her lack of social skills, she fails. Horribly at times. She uses theories she discovered from playing romance visual novels, reading shoujo manga, and she knows what to expect in situations where she tries to make herself stand out. Unfortunately, something usually gets in her way, and ruins her entire plan.It’s an interesting plot setting, although the one large drawback it has, is that there’s no progression, at all. That’s why it is sometimes difficult to get through an episode, because she can’t learn from her mistakes, regardless of how hard she tries.CHARACTERSIf there was a female anime character that I could relate to, it’s Tomoko. Many times I have tried to stand out in certain situations, I prefer to stay indoors as much as possible, I have a negative outlook on life, hell I even have bags under my eyes like she does! In terms of the whole introvert stereotype, it’s pretty much perfect. Her appearance, her speech, the way she acts in (and after) embarrassing situations, her dreams of becoming popular; they’re all really accurate, or at least I think they are.The only downside is that she gets into those embarrassing situations much more often than other introverts. Unlike similar characters like Hachiman Hikigaya from Oregairu, Tomoko has a tendency to act without thinking, or in short, she has a lack of common sense. This is the main reason why she gets into embarrassing situations, which are really bothersome, especially because we, the viewers know that she didn’t have to get into these situations.The secondary characters are pretty much irrelevant. The focus is on Tomoko most of the time, so there isn’t any real room for other characters to come into the spotlight. It isn’t even needed though, as it kinda emphasizes the feeling of solitude that Tomoko has. A nice touch, in my opinion.SOUND & ANIMATIONI watched Watamote in Japanese dub, and I enjoyed it. Because of the lack of characters, the dub consists mainly of Tomoko’s monologuing, as she thinks of her fantasies, insults everyone in her mind (another completely normal thing for introverts) and as she creates various plans of how to get popular. Other than that, she talks almost incomprehensibly when someone is talking to her. Izumi Kitta did a good job on voicing Tomoko. I like the way how she slurs her words, making her sound like a drunk.One thing that I loved, were the common references to other popular anime like ‘Another’, ‘K-ON!’ and the Haruhi Suzumiya series. These references just made me smile, and think “Oh come on... SERIOUSLY?!” A few of the scenes made me wonder how this anime got away with it! Sure, names of characters and groups were partially censored out, but seeing it is still ridiculously entertaining.The soundtrack is, well, average. Because this show isn’t very dark, the music is quite humorous, with not so many tracks that stand out as being really good.  Not a bad soundtrack, but nothing spectacular.One thing that does stand out, is the opening. Screaming heavy metal music, and a mix of images that correspond to the different moods that Tomoko goes through in the anime, make an awesome opening. It is definitely one of my favourites.The animation is where the anime expresses itself. One moment you have normal animation for a normal peaceful scene, and in a moment you have dark gloomy colours for the moments of Tomoko’s  “mishaps”. Special effects and filters are also well used, creating unique atmospheres. The animation for Tomoko is also really good. As I already mentioned, the visual aspect of the stereotype is really good. Pale skin, gloomy expression, messy hair, and of course those eyes...FINAL EVALUATIONEven though I praised the show, quite a bit, I still didn’t enjoy it as I had hoped to. Its biggest problem by far is the lack of progression, which makes some episodes quite boring to watch. Also, the embarrassing situations Tomoko gets herself into get a bit aggravating after a while.The high points of the anime would be Tomoko, as she kept the show going with her personality, and also the changing styles of animation. The show had a lot going for it. If it had taken a more darker path, one that was REALLY depressing and dark, it would have been a lot better, but that’s how I feel about it.7/10.I don’t recommend this show to everyone, fellow introverts can check this out, as well as people who are quite patient.For everyone else, the first 4 to 5 episodes and then you can decide on dropping it or finishing it.Enjoyable, but could have done much better. and super awkward girl, who is about to enter high school, where she believes that her life will change for the better; she will be popular, etc. However, due to her lack of social skills, she fails.

If you are looking for a deep plot, look elsewhere.  Instead we get a slice-of-life style which allows the comedy and main character to shine through.Art (8/10):I found the art and animation to be simple yet high-quality.  The character designs range from good to excellent (and there are some hilarious faces/reactions).  Very good animation in the OP.  Excellent editing, especially the comedic timing.Sound (10/10):Tomoko's VA's performance is a major reason to watch this show.  She nails the comedy, and at the same time creates a complex, sympathetic character.  The OP is pretty good,...and I loved the ending theme.Character (10/10):Tomoko is a deeply flawed character with personality issues and extreme social anxiety.  This is played for laughs, but at the same time it evokes feelings of pity and shame.  However, Tomoko is not one-dimensional.  She can be optimistic, playful, mischievous, and cute.  While she is often in a state of denial or naivete, Tomoko sometimes takes a sober look at her own flaws, wavering between despair and determination to change.  Tomoko is a real underdog and I found myself cheering for her.  Her realistic relationship with her younger brother is also executed very well.  It is not a mistake that the other characters in WataMote remain distant and unremarkable, because our protagonist obviously sees them that way.  In summary, Tomoko is a unique character who easily carries the series alone.Enjoyment (10/10):WataMote will evoke an emotional response - be prepared to be reminded of your own embarrassing past, and to share in Tomoko's awkward moments.  If you can handle that, the comedy will surely entertain and you will fall in love with Tomoko's character.  By the end I was wishing for more.Overall (10/10):A LOT can be said about this show, and it deserves the discussion.  While I see it as a comedy, it is a special type of humor, only for those who can laugh at themselves.  Underneath the comedy there is a serious and very sad theme of social ineptitude which resonated with me.  The presentation is nearly flawless, and it cannot be stressed enough how amazing Tomoko's VA is. and I loved the ending theme.Character (10/10):Tomoko is a deeply flawed character with personality issues and extreme social anxiety.

The MC is dense beyond imagining and has a very warped sense of reality due to what I can only surmise is an undiagnosed mental illness. On top of that she suffers from severe depression. Needless to say, this MC is unique... and that isn\'t a bad thing necessarily. The appeal of this series is the MC interacting with the world. It is like watching an alien from 3rd Rock from the Sun and...there is hilarity to be had.HOWEVER... this series is incredibly depressing. It was hard to get through. The torment this girl goes through in just wanting someone to accept her, acknowledge her, talk to her, hug her... is really hard to stomach. Her episodes into exploring her misunderstandings about the world leave you cringing as you watch as everything goes awry. You should be warned... this anime is not for the light hearted.The character that surprised me was her friend. Out of the blue her middle school friend calls her, a few episodes in, and wants to hang out. The way she is remembered by the MC is as a geeky, unattractive girl. The reality is that her friend bloomed into an attractive and popular girl entering high school... but retained all of her qualities from when she was unpopular. This makes for a unique character. I will be honest, I was expecting the friend to either bail on the MC or have something happen... but she was just really nice. It goes to show you that you can\'t judge a book by its cover.As a side note... the MC has the same eyes as L from Death Note. Just Saiyan.The art style is rather unique and does an amazing job of expressing the many moods of the MC.The soundtrack to this is amazing. The intro and outdo fit perfectly and it sets the tone for the show.The parts where this anime really makes it worth watching are the moments like the end of episode 11, where she gets a hug... and other heart warming scenes that make you go ""awwww."" Trust me, in the right context, you will understand the power of a hug from someone in a bear costume.Would I recommend this anime? Well..... no. Probably not. It is worth a watch if you have some free time and want to see a 12 episode show. Its on Hulu.

She fails at making friends. She fails at saying a simple ""goodbye"" to her teacher after school. She has no one to turn to for guidance, and she is left alone to hopelessly figure out what is wrong with her. But it\'s still a comedy. Why? Because she never really gives up. No matter what happens, she will always recovers and gets up the next day to face the world again. For that reason, this isn\'t a story of a girl\'s...downward spiral into hell but an awkward period of a girl\'s life.This awkward period is presented in many ways. There\'s the creative visual gags to show Tomoko\'s social anxiety. There\'s the overdramatic music and sound effects. There\'s the VA\'s great impression of the average 4chan user if 4chan wasn\'t sausage fest. Tomoko is the greatest character of all time, and I\'m not saying that because there\'s a figure of her staring directly at me as I write this.Of course, I\'m contractually obligated to express the flaws in my favorite anime of all time. Similar to real life, Tomoko\'s self-improvement is slow. She makes similar mistakes repeatedly, and her character development is minimal. This can get frustrating or boring depending on your taste. However, this can be a positive on the realism side. Also, outside of visual gags, the animation is standard. I would cut it some slack since WataMote limited by its budget and the fact that Cloverworks didn\'t animate it. (Cloverworks, please make WataMote Season 2. I loved what you did with Bocchi the Rock. Please do the same to WataMote. You will likely lose millions of dollars, but I will be happy.)Thanks for reading! downward spiral into hell but an awkward period of a girl\'s life.This awkward period is presented in many ways.

I don't go into specific episodes/scenes, though.Let me tell you a little story about one of the worst creations to come out of the cesspool that is 2ch--which is basically Japanese Reddit, before Reddit was a thing. Back in 2004 an anime called Rozen Maiden was airing, and one of the main characters was named Suiseiseki. You need not know about the specifics of the anime, or the character: all you need to know was that Suiseiseki, aside from very rare moments, was yet another one of the many ungrateful, arrogant, and irrationally violent tsunderes that were rampant in anime around...the time, and her sole purpose in life was to make the main character as miserable as possible. Fast-forward a year or two: a character that had been created from the darkest recesses of 2ch was gradually gaining a name for itself--based on a horrible drawing of Suiseiseki that aims to emphasize the uncanny valley effect, this character was named Jissouseki (実装石). Although it initially had several interpretations, stories, and characterizations, all other uses ceased to be as Jissouseki's core features were decided upon: Jissousekis would become the most pathetic, weak, and vile creatures to ever exist. Jissousekis were all of the negative aspects of Suiseiseki turned up to 12: they had the strength of a newborn baby, the agility of a goldfish on land, the perceptive powers of an amoeba, the lifespan of a cicada, and the face of a Cacodemon that had had way, way too many cigarettes. Thus, they were completely dependent on their human masters for survival: even so, they would constantly mock their masters, condescendingly ordering them to get expensive sushi and steak, before proceeding to eat their own feces, or worse, their own children. They feared the likes of domesticated dogs and cats and other small animals, yet would challenge their human masters just because they understood their language, demanding they obey their every whim--already having forgotten that their masters had run out of their patience and just bludgeoned one of their kind to death right in front of them, 5 seconds ago. Jissouseki stories usually went two ways: either the human master is a 'saint' and has it in their heart to care for these utterly ungrateful creatures, or their masters would take joy in the moment they would reduce these monsters into little green pools of blood. The key here is violence: unbridled, over-the-top violence against these lowly and unworthy Jissousekis, to feel better than these disgusting hell-spawn by lifting their baseless hopes up, only to have them come crashing down. Jissouseki comics are incredibly graphic, frequently showing dismemberment, decapitation, amputations, and all kinds of acts that usually belong in snuff films. DO NOT search it unless you're morbidly curious, and don't say I didn't warn you.So, why am I telling you this unappetizing story? Because watching Watamote made me remember these horrible abominations. Or rather, the attitude that the creators have toward the main character reminded me of how Jissousekis are treated. More on that later.Anyway, Watamote's plot is that a high school student named Tomoko, after realizing that she is the furthest one could possibly be from being the school idol, takes various steps to increase her popularity. The problem is that Tomoko is an unattractive, unkempt, socially awkward otaku who can't even properly hold a conversation with the nearest McDonald's part-timer, and can barely whisper out an inaudible 'yes' or 'no' to any given question. What ensues are the various endeavors she undergoes to increase her popularity with the help of her brother and friend, and the catastrophic blunders she makes along every step of the way. These blunders are supposed to be funny. They're not. It took me several days to properly watch this anime: I had to pause almost every 5 minutes because of the sheer amount of discomfort I felt whenever Tomoko, uh, 'exceeded my expectations'.Granted, the animation can be quite decent, especially when Tomoko lets her fantasies run wild. The show does not pull any stops when portraying Tomoko's countless failures. Her face constantly changes to accommodate her current mood, her vomit will be displayed at a crisp frame-rate, etc. Kitta Izumi's voice acting as Tomoko is also quite stellar: she makes sure to act out Tomoko as the creepy otaku girl and her diverse range of reactions, yet can also portray Tomoko's idealized version of herself during her daydreams just fine. Those are this show's only redeeming qualities.Why is that so? It's simple: Tomoko is the most unrealistically unlikable caricature of a human being that could exist. You see, Tomoko's desire to improve herself is not because she truly understands her predicament or how she's viewed by everyone else, or a desire to have a connection with her fellow human beings. She doesn't want to be better: what she 'really' wants is for everyone to be worse than she is, since claiming that everyone is worse than you are takes considerably less effort than actually owning up to your problems and trying to dig yourself out of them. Tomoko needs to feel superior to everyone else so she can keep living out her shut-in otaku life, and to continue doing so will cling to the few safe grounds she has left. She fantasizes about dating various boys and becoming popular out of the blue, yet mocks whoever she can whenever they do something she can only daydream about, even something as simple as going to a karaoke. She secretly mocks her only friend and the various strides she took to better herself, ranging from calling her an airhead to a bitch/slut, yet clings to her when she, in Tomoko's eyes, shows signs of ditching Tomoko to pursue a vibrant high school life without her.The spectrum of emotions Tomoko displays when she's faced with any problem ranges from cowardice to denial, delusional to suicidal, and depressed to unbearably smug. Her cataclysmal lack of social awareness, combined with her constant self-deprecation and unwillingness to apply any kind of critical thinking or common sense when presented with a problem further strengthens her warped perception of reality where she's just a misunderstood genius, and said perception feeds into both her delusions and social ineptitude. This vicious cycle, in the context of the anime, always results in her committing several faux pas in a single episode, with varying degrees of awkward and humiliating situations. Tomoko is the personification of what Japan thinks otakus are at their absolute worst: creepy, passive-aggressive, opportunistic, anti-social, egotistical, irreceptive of any criticism towards anything remotely related to themselves, and, worst of all, completely oblivious to their own demeanor.It is because Tomoko is so thoroughly unlikable that every single one of her attempts to socialize is not only painful to look at, but also rings hollow even in her self-proclaimed 'victory'. What counts as social interactions for her are equivalent to a baby shouting out whatever word it heard from their surroundings. If she succeeds, you can make sure she'll goad about it the very next moment in the most frustratingly condescending way ever, especially so because said victory never truly mattered. If she fails, she will fail in the most unfunny and miserable way imaginable, and she is guaranteed to swing back and forth from denial to endless self-induced verbal abuse. And she will fail. Again. And again. And again. And again. And just when you think she couldn't fail again, she will manage to do so in the most exaggerated, spectacularly painful and self-degrading way possible, further dragging her into self-pity and misery. Tomoko must fail in order for the 'comedy' of the show to continue; she must be the most pathetic being imaginable; she must be MORE pathetic than any viewer imaginable, just like Jissouseki, who's not even a human. She must fail, for if she starts succeeding even a little bit, the cycle cannot continue.When someone makes a mistake once, it is sometimes quite hilarious, and people can joke about said mishap. When they do so for a second, then a third, then a fourth and fifth time, it's no longer funny. For what you're witnessing is no longer a mistake: it is a display of willful ignorance and total denial. That 'mistake' will happen again, because it's not a freak accident: it's a pattern, and one you're all too familiar with. You're watching someone with several mental health and self-esteem issues develop an increasingly self-destructive outlook on life, and watching their mental fortitude deteriorate by the minute. You don't even like that person, and yet it's still too much. They will repeatedly do so, and continue to fumble about.THAT is the humor of this show. The extent of the comedy in this show is that you're beating a dying animal to death, and laughing at how it twitches in pain at an impossible angle until you can hear it choking on its own blood. Oh, and it also shit itself. Shitting yourself is funny, right? And if it was funny once, then it's okay to do it over and over again, right? Next time it'll just have to shit out rainbows, and everyone will be howling with laughter, right?Do you see now why I compared Jissouseki and Tomoko, and why I cannot stand either of them? They were purposely created to be repulsive, incapable, spineless, and most importantly, defenseless. Both of their stories are centered around getting a kick from watching them be kicked around. The more pathetic they are, and the harder you kick them, the greater the resulting humor and catharsis from watching their downfall, supposedly. Except Jissouseki is, at the very least, non-human. Tomoko is 'supposed' to be a human. Impure intentions and illusions of grandeur aside, Tomoko's dreams are not that too far off from other people: she just wants to feel normal and live a decent life, without having to feel so uncomfortable in her own skin. Compared to her fantasies, this is a tangible and realistic goal that can be reached with adequate help. However, the story dictates that this can never come true, and will strike her down at the quickest moment: we are robbed of any lasting progress and potential character development to, yet again, witness Tomoko regress to the sub-human she is preordained to be.Watamote is, in one word, abusive. Abusive towards Tomoko, for there is no scenario in which she wins or gets what she wants. She lacks the skills necessary to get what she wants, and she doesn't know what she actually wants: Tomoko's struggles were destined for failure from the very start. Watamote is also abusive towards its viewers: it goes out of its way to make absolutely sure that every single day of Tomoko's life is filled with sorrow and humiliation, and the synergy of the unusual cruelty of the story and Tomoko's own thick demeanor results in the viewers being the ones who go through the brunt of the embarrassment she is subject to. Nothing is gained, for Tomoko or the viewers: there is no resolution, no hope, and no form of catharsis. There is no progress. Tomoko does not gain crucial knowledge of her surroundings or her own situation. She does not make herself known to her classmates, or shows her resolve in any meaningful, lasting manner. She does not suddenly transform into a 'better' person, and she does not suddenly get loads of friends. Hell, she does not become close to ONE new person throughout the entire 12 episodes, let alone make a new friend. She remains, and will be, blissfully unaware of herself. Everything Tomoko does is inefficient, unnecessary, and serves only to further sully the last vestiges of her dignity. She will repeat this fruitless cycle endlessly, cursed to act out her Sisyphean floundering. I watched a comedy, and have come out of it feeling...sad. It's just so sad. Watamote is the most sadistic and vacuous enaction of human futility I have ever seen, and I never want to think about it ever again. the time, and her sole purpose in life was to make the main character as miserable as possible. Fast-forward a year or two: a character that had been created from the darkest recesses of 2ch was gradually gaining a name for itself--based on a horrible drawing of Suiseiseki that aims to emphasize the uncanny valley effect, this character was named Jissouseki (実装石). Although it initially had several interpretations, stories, and characterizations, all other uses ceased to be as Jissouseki's core features were decided upon: Jissousekis would become the most pathetic, weak, and vile creatures to ever exist. Jissousekis were all of the negative aspects of Suiseiseki turned up to 12: they had the strength of a newborn baby, the agility of a goldfish on land, the perceptive powers of an amoeba, the lifespan of a cicada, and the face of a Cacodemon that had had way, way too many cigarettes. Thus, they were completely dependent on their human masters for survival: even so, they would constantly mock their masters, condescendingly ordering them to get expensive sushi and steak, before proceeding to eat their own feces, or worse, their own children. They feared the likes of domesticated dogs and cats and other small animals, yet would challenge their human masters just because they understood their language, demanding they obey their every whim--already having forgotten that their masters had run out of their patience and just bludgeoned one of their kind to death right in front of them, 5 seconds ago. Jissouseki stories usually went two ways: either the human master is a 'saint' and has it in their heart to care for these utterly ungrateful creatures, or their masters would take joy in the moment they would reduce these monsters into little green pools of blood. The key here is violence: unbridled, over-the-top violence against these lowly and unworthy Jissousekis, to feel better than these disgusting hell-spawn by lifting their baseless hopes up, only to have them come crashing down. Jissouseki comics are incredibly graphic, frequently showing dismemberment, decapitation, amputations, and all kinds of acts that usually belong in snuff films. DO NOT search it unless you're morbidly curious, and don't say I didn't warn you.So, why am I telling you this unappetizing story? Because watching Watamote made me remember these horrible abominations. Or rather, the attitude that the creators have toward the main character reminded me of how Jissousekis are treated. More on that later.Anyway, Watamote's plot is that a high school student named Tomoko, after realizing that she is the furthest one could possibly be from being the school idol, takes various steps to increase her popularity. The problem is that Tomoko is an unattractive, unkempt, socially awkward otaku who can't even properly hold a conversation with the nearest McDonald's part-timer, and can barely whisper out an inaudible 'yes' or 'no' to any given question. What ensues are the various endeavors she undergoes to increase her popularity with the help of her brother and friend, and the catastrophic blunders she makes along every step of the way. These blunders are supposed to be funny. They're not. It took me several days to properly watch this anime: I had to pause almost every 5 minutes because of the sheer amount of discomfort I felt whenever Tomoko, uh, 'exceeded my expectations'.Granted, the animation can be quite decent, especially when Tomoko lets her fantasies run wild. The show does not pull any stops when portraying Tomoko's countless failures. Her face constantly changes to accommodate her current mood, her vomit will be displayed at a crisp frame-rate, etc. Kitta Izumi's voice acting as Tomoko is also quite stellar: she makes sure to act out Tomoko as the creepy otaku girl and her diverse range of reactions, yet can also portray Tomoko's idealized version of herself during her daydreams just fine. Those are this show's only redeeming qualities.Why is that so? It's simple: Tomoko is the most unrealistically unlikable caricature of a human being that could exist. You see, Tomoko's desire to improve herself is not because she truly understands her predicament or how she's viewed by everyone else, or a desire to have a connection with her fellow human beings. She doesn't want to be better: what she 'really' wants is for everyone to be worse than she is, since claiming that everyone is worse than you are takes considerably less effort than actually owning up to your problems and trying to dig yourself out of them. Tomoko needs to feel superior to everyone else so she can keep living out her shut-in otaku life, and to continue doing so will cling to the few safe grounds she has left. She fantasizes about dating various boys and becoming popular out of the blue, yet mocks whoever she can whenever they do something she can only daydream about, even something as simple as going to a karaoke. She secretly mocks her only friend and the various strides she took to better herself, ranging from calling her an airhead to a bitch/slut, yet clings to her when she, in Tomoko's eyes, shows signs of ditching Tomoko to pursue a vibrant high school life without her.The spectrum of emotions Tomoko displays when she's faced with any problem ranges from cowardice to denial, delusional to suicidal, and depressed to unbearably smug. Her cataclysmal lack of social awareness, combined with her constant self-deprecation and unwillingness to apply any kind of critical thinking or common sense when presented with a problem further strengthens her warped perception of reality where she's just a misunderstood genius, and said perception feeds into both her delusions and social ineptitude. This vicious cycle, in the context of the anime, always results in her committing several faux pas in a single episode, with varying degrees of awkward and humiliating situations.

Watamote is the most sadistic and vacuous enaction of human futility I have ever seen, and I never want to think about it ever again."", 'Watamote is about a girl in high school coping with social anxiety. The comedy/tragedy however, is that she is really oblivious to it. Throughout the story, she seeks out reasons as to why she doesn\'t have many friends or isn\'t popular amongst her classmates, that derive from the point of her simply being very socially anxious and afraid to talk to people. Her reasons often become very farfetched and crazy, leading to comedic effect, and at the same time, it is depressing.The thing I\'d like to applaud the most is the anime\'s intro. Nothing could capture the overall message of the story better. It involves...Tomoko, chained to a wall in a city street while ordinary people are occassionally passing by her. She wishes to break free of the chain but as it is, she is unpopular, a freak, tied to this fate of being seperated from the rest, unable to be with them because she\'s stuck, she can\'t reach out to others because she has a hard time speaking to them, however, throughout the song\'s lyrics it is more about Tomoko\'s perspective, instead of the reality; ""To be popular, I have to try hard"".I\'ve never seen an anime intro that closely tied to the story in a deep way. It has true meaning, and it isn\'t difficult to understand the metaphors. Even though I\'m not always a fan of Heavy Metal, I feel like the music genre is at its best in these situations: someone who\'s angry, disgruntled with things, literally shouting out their frustrations about their recent life situation. You don\'t need to look further than the first 3 seconds of the anime intro to notice what it\'s all about, a cry of frustration; ""AHH! THAT\'S IT, NO MORE!""Throughout the story, there are plenty of uncomfortable moments, as you\'d expect. Without giving away any specific scenarios, let\'s just say that poor Tomoko gets humiliated, or humiliates herself, in a massive variety of ways. Chances are you\'ll be able to relate to her, or at least sympathize with her. Tomoko is somewhat paranoid, and she\'s a heavy sufferer of what is known as ""the spotlight effect"" in psychology. She assumes people will notice every minute detail about her or things she does. It\'s a sad spectacle. This condition is noticeably present in a lot of people, but it\'s a lot worse with those suffering from social anxiety, as they\'re so self-conscious about themselves. There\'s moments in the anime where, in Tomoko\'s imagination, a spotlight is literally cast on her while she\'s in a room with other people. The symbolism only drives things further.Psychology aside... The entertainment factor is high. I couldn\'t stop as soon as I began watching, until the series was over, over a period of 3 days or so. What I liked about it most? It\'s the fact that this anime truly only focuses on one person. Few anime pull it off to this degree. I\'m always interested in getting to know a character this much, how they feel. It\'s harder to get that from an anime where it\'s always very ""third-person"", as if you\'re a security camera, watching a group of people interact with one another. That isn\'t truly getting to know them, unlike here. And I think this is what draws me to Watamote.I\'ll definitely give it a 9. There are of course other \'personal story\' anime out there, but this one is in a really contemporary setting, and therefore a lot of people can relate to Tomoko\'s daily struggle. I hope it gives those viewers some comfort in knowing that they\'re not alone with their problems, since many other viewers have also been able to relate to the poor girl. Watamote is truly a bonding experience. Tomoko, chained to a wall in a city street while ordinary people are occassionally passing by her.

She has a slight bit of enjoyment, then it comes crashing down. It starts to get predictable. I did like the character mostly because some people could relate to her, and over all she's funny. I do recommend the anime. "", '(no spoilers)Well, I took two months to step back on my viewpoint about this anime, and I think I\'m ready to write a review on it.Watamote is a very special anime, which describes humorously the sad days of an unpopular school girl. And depending the viewpoint you will take when watching it, you will like it or dislike it. It really FULLY depends on that, and that\'s why the opinions are very contrasted.Art : 7/10Studio : Silver LinkReally nothing to complain here, the graphics are watchable. Nothing exceptional though. The efforts put especially on the main character design is really noticeable and enjoyable....Sound : 7/10The OST were fitting to the scenes. Nothing exceptional again. I was hoping for more effort.Bonus point for the opening, though. Really awesome, I\'m still listening it.Character : 8/10Tomoko\'s character is really unique. With an appearance of a stereotypical unsociable girl, her personality is authentic, in a stereotyped world. What the scenarist did is awesome here, because every classmate of Tomoko will see her as the stereotypical unsociable girl, but here, we\'re seeing the exact opposite. Big green thumb for the scenarist, who transmitted successfully the message he wanted to transmit.Story : 8/10Even if the scenario is repetitive and quite predictable when it comes to Tomoko, the scenarist managed to build a complete story which leaves absolutely no gaps anywhere. He condensed everything he had to include and the result is really not bad, contrary to some animes where the story is rushed. Nice job.Enjoyment : 10/10This is where a lot of opinions will be contrasted. I\'m sure everybody understood the story, but how the player will take it will vary only on himself, and will considerably change his opinion.Without spoiling, to be honest, I think the story may be considered as a drama. Some people may even feel more bad when they\'re watching this than when they\'re watching a real drama. Other people will just take it lightly and laugh. And that\'s the morale of the story.This is a big message for everyone who thinks they currently have a sad school life. ""There is worser than your life, and the best way to bear it is to take it lightly, and laugh at yourself.""So basically, if you look the anime with an internal viewpoint (from Tomoko\'s viewpoint), you will feel very bad for her and you may dislike this anime, because what she lives is the last thing you want to live in your whole life.That\'s why I\'d advice to watch this anime from an external viewpoint. Just witness of her life and laugh at it, as how you should take it, from the scenarist\'s viewpoint.This isn\'t a drama. This is a comedy. Don\'t forget it.Overall : 9/10~ Sound : 7/10The OST were fitting to the scenes. Nothing exceptional again. I was hoping for more effort.Bonus point for the opening, though.

Now Kuroki is a pretty damn relatable character and an entertaining one at that with all the funny shit that goes on in her head like various anime references. As far as characters go I had absolutely no problems with them as I kind of liked most of them.Now my big problem with this anime which to me is a big hindrance is the ending, there kind of isn\'t an ending nor any resolution to the show, no over arching story, and with that I feel there is a lot of wasted potential as Kuroki\'s dilemma of being the unpopular girl never really gets resolved, she never comes out of her shell and her character never really develops which doesn\'t spoil much considering that the only thing in this show that actually progresses is time and personally I felt kind of disappointed in the end.Art/Sound:The art and animation is definitely the one thing that holds up though out the entire series, the character designs are simple yet detailed especially Kuroki who kind of looks like a goth chick at times. The animation with all the shot angles was creative and smooth for the most part.The soundtrack through the show was kind of forgettable but the opening song defiantly wasn\'t and makes up for it a little.Sub/Dub:I don\'t have much to say except that the dub is one of Sentai Filmworks better works but isn\'t all that big a deal so I couldn\'t really care less about either version of this show.One fun fact about the english dub is in one of the last episodes, the show makes a reference to an anime called ""Another"" where Kuroki is Mei Misaki (the chick with the eyepatch) and I thought it was kind of funny considering both of those characters were voiced by Monica Rial; the same VA.Final verdict:I\'m rating this anime a 5/10, I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend this to anyone but I wouldn\'t say it was a bad anime either. a desire to become popular.

Wakamote is a very intimate and personal depiction of a girl - who may as well not exist in the eyes of her classmates.Otaku, Mojo, Recluse, Dysfunctional, Shut-in... Once you step into the shoes of Tomoko - who appears to closely relate to all of these terms, you'll understand loneliness and social anxiety on a whole new level.Due to this blatantly dark overriding theme, you'd think it would be quite a depressing anime to watch. While it...is all very tragic when put into into perspective, Wakamote utilises a conflicting combination of comedy, realism and SoL styled expression that makes it quite a peculiar watch.In terms of presentation, Wakamote, from start to finish unfolds through the eyes (and mind for that matter) of our beloved heroine: Tomoko. The show makes use of powerful SoL elements such as expression of her thought processes - through mental monologues and rants, and the inclusion of exaggerating, comedic visuals. Ultimately, this combination allows for the anime to be extremely expressive, and therefore easier to get into.The plot line is simply Tomoko's journey through typical high school life, as she tries to make use of radical, and often illogical methods to become popular - which ironically would make her a less interesting, less edgy and relatable character if this were an easy feat for her. As an anime that incorporates a lot of SoL themes, it's main strength shines through the character craft more so than the chronological order of events - which is definitely something to keep in mind if you weren't already aware.Now when i say characters, i basically just mean Tomoko when it comes to Wakamote; as she is the only properly developed presence - talk about putting all your eggs in one basket huh Sqaure Enix. Fortunately, having Tomoko as the particularly blatant focal point of the franchise did wonders for the show's atmosphere from a wider scope. Having only one character that you truly get to experience the personality of, made the series seem more intimately detailed, personal, and gave a great sense of defiance of, and struggle against modern society.Tomoko thinks and speaks a lot of truth i must say; and her particularly lonesome lifestyle is definately not far fetched or alien. Despite how the comedy side of the show makes her out to be a bit of a freak, i feel that Tomoko gives Wakamote all of its charm, as a lot of the social topics covered and presented as serious undertones throughout are just so relatable for many. Obviously not to this extent, but i can definitely resonate from experience with Tomoko's plight, as that's really what the show is about...Wakamote is a tragic and serious, yet lighthearted and charming, awareness-raising expression of a variety of everyday social plights. Some may find comfort this realism, whereas others may simply laugh at Tomoko's eventful, and yet lonely life. No matter which side of the fence you're on, i'd say that those who're looking for a SoL that's not entirely rainbows and lolipops have found a good match. Looking back at the series, it would have been nice to have some sequential story presentation to compliment Tomoko's journey of self-discovery, or more appropriately: self-confirmation...  But asides from this, and the general lack of depth - mostly down to general time-scaling, i thoroughly enjoyed the show.Mostly i'd say this was because i enjoyed the refreshing craft of Tomoko as a character - and so it was a pleasure to get to better understand her slightly psychopathic personality (like mine).~ No matter how i look at it. It's you guys' fault i'm not popular! ~ is all very tragic when put into into perspective, Wakamote utilises a conflicting combination of comedy, realism and SoL styled expression that makes it quite a peculiar watch.In terms of presentation, Wakamote, from start to finish unfolds through the eyes (and mind for that matter) of our beloved heroine: Tomoko. The show makes use of powerful SoL elements such as expression of her thought processes - through mental monologues and rants, and the inclusion of exaggerating, comedic visuals. Ultimately, this combination allows for the anime to be extremely expressive, and therefore easier to get into.The plot line is simply Tomoko's journey through typical high school life, as she tries to make use of radical, and often illogical methods to become popular - which ironically would make her a less interesting, less edgy and relatable character if this were an easy feat for her.

The story follows a 15 year old girl named Tomoko Kuroki, who spends too much time playing dating simulators and watching videos. As a result, she is an unsociable loner, and suffers from social anxiety. Though the plot seemed interesting at first, it rarely moved on, and when it did , it just followed the same premise over and over again, which was putting Tomoko in some sort of awkward or embarrassing situation. I didn’t mind this repetitive formula at first,...because the character and situations were very entertaining, for the most part, but then it just kept building and building until the very end which had no real payoff, as she never changes her ways.I believe this problem stems from the writers trying too hard to be unpredictable and un-cliche. All throughout the anime, the writers play with your expectations that come from other anime formulas and they decided that ending the show with a young girl trying to make the most of her adolescence by learning from the embarrassing events in her life was just too cliche.If this is the case and the writers just truly wanted to stand out and be unique, then they could have ended it with something better than what we got. Because the ending we got was a teenager who blames all of her peers for her problems out of sheer jealousy, and will continue to do so, instead of learning from her mistakes and experiences. Sure, this ending isn’t cliche, but that’s because it isn’t interesting and doesn’t give any sense of closure. The only explanation that would make sense of all of this would be if the ending was setting up for a season 2. Even then, it’d still be pretty bad.Every embarrassing event Tomoko went through left me with this expectation of her to learn something from them. When I finally reached the end, all I got was disappointment that I could have literally skipped episodes 2-11 without missing anything other than a few humorous scenes. And that’s another thing. The comedy in this anime is really awkward. And when I mean really awkward, I mean REALLY awkward. Sure, I laughed at it, but for the wrong reasons. I laughed only to try to make myself feel more comfortable with the awkward situation because if I didn’t it would just be flat out sad and torturous.The art and sound were good for the most part. I think appropriate would be a better word, as most of the time the music and art style just matched the tone of a scene, instead of being pleasant. I’ll admit I found it really hilarious when the music would match Tomoko’s mood and would go from sounding pleasant, to going off pitch and sounding horrible.Throughout the anime Tomoko goes from an interesting character with a lot of potential, to an unlikable disaster. I think she was written with the intent to be relatable to, as we’ve all had our insecurities and embarrassing/awkward stages in our lives; this is what makes the anime funny. The writers seem to be pushing the viewers to try to sympathize with Tomoko, for instance, the scene where she sits and eats alone. The truth is, we all hated this part of our lives and we knew we were being unreasonable by blaming everyone else but ourselves, and not even attempting to make friends or talk to others.This is where the issue of Tomoko never changing or maturing really comes into play. Halfway through the show, her thoughts just begin to sound like childish whining and complaining. Why should we sympathize with her if she isn’t willing to change or grow up? Where is the lesson to be learned from all of this? That it’s okay to be unreasonable? The lesson is so unclear, that I decided that there just never was one to begin with.That being said I believe this anime could be enjoyed if watched with a different perspective than that of other shows. The serious lack of story progression and character development seems to follow the same formula for a comedy or sitcom where funny things happen, but the plot never really progresses at all. If watched from this perspective I believe that are some genuinely funny moments that we could relate to and laugh at.To sum it all up, I was never really “bored”, while watching this anime because it always had situational humor. However, the same could be said about any junky cartoon show or comedy. Unfortunately, I look for more when I watch anime, and this barely average one continues to leave me disappointed and unsatisfied.And remember..""Seriously, it doesn’t even matter"" because the character and situations were very entertaining, for the most part, but then it just kept building and building until the very end which had no real payoff, as she never changes her ways.I believe this problem stems from the writers trying too hard to be unpredictable and un-cliche.

She is also prone to social anxiety, if you can call it that.  Heard the premise before?  Well it\'s different, because there is no sugarcoating Tomoko\'s personality or the events that surround her.The mannerisms of the Tomoko seem very over the top at times, but to me it represents her inner turmoil, what she\'s thinking constantly, and that really brings the character to life.What I loved most about the anime wasn\'t how bad the situations got for her,...but how brutally honest the writing was.  Usually, the writing will make these sort of characters more sympathetic, having some sort of painful past.  Not with Watamote, no sir.  You get the real deal and the whole package with Tomoko, even if some of those parts are detestable.  Human\'s are not perfect, and it\'s good to see a character that can reflect that idea.  I love the fact that people who can relate to Tomoko in one way or another cannot deny some of their own flaws ie. feeling misguided resentment for one\'s own social shortcomings (""they\'re just sluts anyways!"").*So with that said, if you either can\'t deal with depressing subject matter (you will be a little depressed regardless of the humor) or you can\'t accept some of the flaws you and Tomoko may share, don\'t watch the show.

Not because its bad, but because i relate to the MC to such a degree that it makes my heart ache. I cant really watch and enjoy (lol) this show for what it is when i constantly feel like I'm witnessing a documentary of an alternate reality where i was a freshman girl. The depictions of crippling social  anxiety and overwhelming loneliness are incredible. Putting on ten different masks just to maybe start a conversation with someone, being too anxious to talk to others in critical situations, pretending that continuously spending time alone is...fine until you cant take it anymore, being deathly afraid that you are barely living your life, while simultaneously feeling powerless to make a change.  Its all too real, and I'm disgusted at myself for just getting used to this lifestyle. In an incredible irony, this show reminded me that I'm living a terrible life.

Thanks watamote"", 'Short review.You probably might think that I\'m a lunatic for giving Watamote a 9 but hear me out.I know that this anime is the largest mass of cringe for anyone who couldn\'t relate to the main character, Tomoko. I understand that this anime is not made for everyone and very few people would actually like this anime.But on top of all that, I think that Watamote is one of the most realistic shows out there. There is no miracle that happens in the story, there isn\'t some crazy badass man to come save the main character and everything in the anime screams ""You\'re on your...own"". Tomoko was someone that I personally could relate to so much, from how she\'s unsociable to how she has all these crazy thoughts in her head.In terms of story and progression, there really isn\'t a whole much. If you pay attention, you\'ll realize the very small details on how maybe that Tomoko has improved just a tiny bit from the start of the show.Overall, stay away from the anime if you don\'t want to be dragged into cringe-hell.

It is basically about the trials a girl with social anxiety have to go through trying to be the most popular girl in school. And of course she utterly fails at everything she does. As someone that does have social anxiety, i relate to this so much. They however do exaggerate things a little but that is what makes this show so fun to watch. Also, the occasional crude humor helps too. I personally believe this how is suppose to be targeted at people who have some form of social anxiety as they are the ones who can...relate to the show the most.STORY:There isnt much i can say in terms of story as this show is every episodic. But i can say that each trial she goes through, to me at least, is written pretty well.ANIMATION:This is the part where i believe most people think was done marvelously. The animation and the way the character is drawn fits perfectly to the tone of the situation and how the character feels. Even in scenes where nothing spectacular is going on, lets say walking, the way it is depicted is extremely visually pleasing. I have to mention the opening as it was done really well too. You just have to see it to fully understand how well it was done.SOUND:The voice actor for Tomoko ( the main character ) was SOOOO GOOD. The voice she gives for each different emotion sounds so distinct. I remember a scene where Tomoko is acting all cold and mighty, and the change from the scared little girl, to the mature and 'i dont care about you' girl so just sooooo (Y)(Y)(Y). The background music for different scenes also fits the atmosphere really well.I REALLLY enjoyed this show as i was watching it. Seeing Tomoko fail at everything and getting embarrass at small little things is just so funny. Though sometimes i really pity her too. I've seen in wiki that when it was airing, people debated whether it was 'a comedy or a study of neurosis'. Im like its just a freaking comedy anime. Chill~~ Anyways, overall i give this show a 8/10, and think that you should definitely check this show out just to give yourself a good laugh. relate to the show the most.STORY:There isnt much i can say in terms of story as this show is every episodic.

As a comedy, WataMote mostly fails. While it could get a good laugh out of me every now and then, most of the time I just felt either pity or embarrassment. Most viewers will find relatable qualities in Tomoko, although I seriously hope not too many of them. I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen something as weird as this. Or maybe it wasn\'t intended to be like this and we were supposed...to laugh at the loser girl? Anyway, this is a very awkward watch and not funny most of the time (though very funny when it is).4/10Art:WataMote looks quite good. During many of Tomokos fantasies/delusions, the art style shifts to something else, either a sparkly shoujo world or a cubic portrait of her or the pencil drawings that we also see in the opening. That is very creative and keeps the show from becoming too dull to look at. The character design for the main character is certainly something else, while the rest of the cast (except maybe her brother) look rather generic, though that\'s the point.8/10Sound:I love the opening. Not only does it hit my taste in music, it also fits nicely with Tomokos inner anger at the world (one episode transitioned into the opening, which was pretty awesome). The ending song is another case of terrible in a cute way. Izumi Kitta does an outstanding job as Tomoko, rarely have I heard somebody living their character that much, no doubt one of the best seiyuu works I\'ve ever heard. Everybody else does their job well too.9/10Characters:This is a one (wo)man show anime and stands and falls with the main character. Most people will agree, that it\'s next to impossible to not feel sorry for her. Every teenager has gone through phases like this, and if you weren\'t a popular kid, it was even worse. Tomoko however is the ultimate queen of teenage angst and unpopularity. While you may laugh at one part, another will make you go ""uh, I know how that feels"". I have to state though, that much of this is her own damn fault. She rejects the world and the people around her and keeps herself from making any progress, so you shouldn\'t just see a victim in her. It\'s okay to want to see her succeed, but she also deserves some of the things happening to her. Long story short, Tomoko is a very interesting character with lots of shades. (Shout ot to Imae, who\'s a really nice girl)9/10Enjoyment:Did I enjoy WataMote? Yes and no. It was entertaining all the way through, but it felt uncomfortable too often to make me say I ""enjoyed"" it. Once you realize that Tomoko will never break the circle, it robs you of anything to hope or look forward to. If you have a sadistic kind of humor though, you will probably like this anime a lot. For me, it was nice to see once, but I wouldn\'t come back to watch it again.6/10Overall:7.2/10 to laugh at the loser girl?

Though I’m still not that comfortable talking to someone that I’m not familiar with, I’ve learned to control this “illness” by keeping everyone at an arm’s length. I hide behind my personal shell in order to be as professional as I possibly can. Now, back tracking to 2 years ago, a certain show came up. Watashi ga Motenai no Wa Dou Kangaete mou Omaera ga Warui! (yeah, I typed that. No google.), Watamote... a show that has the same premise that people with same “illness” are supposed to relate to. Well, at...least that’s what the show intended to do… on paper.Story:Now, forgive me when I say this but this show… is shit. That’s your cue to get the fuck out if you’re one of the few people who liked this series. I don’t know why people love this show so much when it came out. This show was made not for people with social anxieties to relate with but this show is rather made in order to make fun of them. People go “Oh, I know what it feels to be in this situation. I feel for her.” but at the end of the day, let’s be honest, all the situations she’s been through is created for comedic reasons. I have a hunch that the author of the manga is one of the “popular ones” that knows someone like Tomoko and goes something like “Hah! This human’s situation is ridiculously amusing, I should make a manga even if my drawings are as bad as her situations so I can sell it and make some quick buck.”. I’d like to say that the series HAD potential after the first episode but rather than improving her situation, nothing changes apart from her situation getting worse every episode. To quote Alain from Bakashift, “the entire series is the first episode 12 times”. This is a review of the anime but from what I’ve seen in the manga, nothing has changed. There’s a scene in the manga where she was participating in a marathon then she suddenly felt an urge to shit. What did she do? She knocked on the door of a total stranger and asked the homeowner if she can use their bathroom… *sigh*. That’s the last chapter I’ve seen and decided to never again touch that abomination. Let’s just make one thing clear… I’m not offended on how the series made fun of my previous/semi-present situation. I don’t take any show to a personal level (except ef: melodies & oregairu) so don’t start pointing fingers.Character:Every character in this series is more interesting than the main character. See, their personalities are so colorful and interesting that sometimes I wonder what will happen if they’re taken out of the series to be moved to a completely different show as the main character. I can surely watch that show and probably not be pissed about it. In the topic of moving characters from this series to another, I wonder what’ll happen if I move Tomoko and put her in a series like Berserk, Deadman Wonderland, or High School of The Dead/Gyo? I just want to see her get killed miserably and have a good laugh so forgive me. Hmm… Now, for the sake of my reviewing format, let’s talk about the “main character” Kuroki Tomoko.See, I can understand her situation if she got bullied or something but no such thing was mentioned in the series or in the manga from what I’ve read. Why is she such a despicable tiny little shit? No one in the series (except her younger brother) talks badly about her yet she treats everybody like they’re trash. Maybe, just maybe, this is her way to hide her inferiority complex but still… why? Also, she calls her best friend, the ONLY ONE person that she can portray herself as herself a bitch? You know as an atheist, I don’t believe in hell but let me just say that there’s a special place in hell for people like her. I really don’t think she has any redeemable traits. Wait, let’s be fair, I’ll think about it for a minute… just a minute… Hmmm… She’s a liar, she cheats to beat kids in card games, she searches pictures of penises on her phone during class, she badmouths everybody… nah, nothing. I hate her, that’s that. If you count that as a “redeemable trait” then by all means do so.Animation:Silver Link… What are the other shows they’ve made? *searches google*. Baka and Test/Akiyuki Shinbo Jr. directs a show outside Shaft, Kokoro Connect/Four kids exchange bodies while Inaba remains best girl, and this season’s (Fall 2015) “The Worst One” and The 35th Anti-Magic Platoon. Well, the studio’s not really “up-there” by a long shot by they have their merits. In Watamote, the character designs don’t really appeal to my taste but at least it’s better than what is on the manga. It’s pretty normal with some amazing utilization of angles. There are some scenes where everything goes landscape mode and that was amazing. Apart from that, nothing else. I really have nothing cool to say about the animation section because it’s pretty much average with not much about it standing out.Sounds:Apart from the OP and the Natsu Matsuri ED, I find everything about this soundtrack forgettable. Like in the animation section, everything when it comes to music, at least from my perspective, is pretty standard. Nothing much stood out and it was probably happy to be at least forgettable.Now, disregarding that fact, let’s talk about the dub. Monica Rial as Tomoko… is fucking amazing. When I first heard that Monica Rial was playing as Tomoko I went “fucking nailed it!”. See, I hate, I despise, I LOATHE Monica Rial like you can’t even imagine. But that fact aside, I also know her potentials… well, if you can really call it “potential”. I know what her voice is capable of. And when I finally got the chance to re-watch it dubbed, my expectations were not betrayed. She sounds fucking awesome as Tomoko. How can I put this if you haven’t seen the dub and just refuse to? Hmm.. Let’s just say Tomoko’s seiyuu is capable of speaking fluently in English. There, the best example I can think of. Monica Rial and Tomoko’s seiyuu sounds like one person to be honest. Re-watching Watamote was a pain but since Monica Rial finally finds a role that she’s 100% compatible with, it became a bit bearable. I finished re-watching it not because I liked it but because I was deeply moved by Monica Rial’s performance which is coming from a hater, is probably a good thing, right?Verdict:I never really wanted to review this series but I found myself having too much to say about this series when I was looking for something to review. This series is one of the few series out there where I question myself as to why it even exists. Apparently, it was popular in 4chan but popularity is pretty subjective in my eyes. The producers were like “Oh… this manga is popular overseas! Let’s make it an anime so we can sell it abroad for a couple of bucks.” Well, I think they’ve succeeded in doing so. Now, can we stop it at that? I heard there is an ongoing petition in the internet to make another season of this series. People, if you’ve indeed signed this petition, please tell me your name and where you live so I can shake your hand personally… and burn your house.With all that said, I’ll (not) gladly give Watamote an overall score of 4.88 out of 10. I seriously wanted to give it a lower score but since I follow my own formula when it comes to scoring, the score was somehow pulled by the animation and sounds section. I may have talked about how shit this entire series is throughout my show but it’s really not as bad as I claim it to be. Maybe it just rubs me the wrong way and didn’t laugh as much as a chuckle while watching it but who knows? You might like it if your tickle bone is softer than mine. Well, that’s your decision. Try not to use my review as an excuse to not watch it. I still recommend the series, though I don’t want to, if you want to laugh at other’s misfortunes. That’s your call.Alternate Anime Recommendation:For alternate recommendation, why don’t you try My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu (I recently found out that snafu was in fact a word. I was surprised to be honest)? A series that has the same premise: a loner trying to fit in society, or rather in school. But in Snafu’s case, Hachiman, the protagonist is the textbook example of how loners should act (though he crosses the line sometimes). I’ve said before that I consider Hachiman as the torchbearer of loners worldwide and I still believe that fact.Also, if you don’t want that, there’s always Welcome to The NHK. A show that Watamote should have been but never did. That’s all you need to know.Well, that’s it for me. Thanks for reading again as always. Bye! least that’s what the show intended to do… on paper.Story:Now, forgive me when I say this but this show… is shit. That’s your cue to get the fuck out if you’re one of the few people who liked this series. I don’t know why people love this show so much when it came out. This show was made not for people with social anxieties to relate with but this show is rather made in order to make fun of them. People go “Oh, I know what it feels to be in this situation. I feel for her.” but at the end of the day, let’s be honest, all the situations she’s been through is created for comedic reasons.

The characters never make substantial change or their achieve goals. (plus prospects for a season 2 aren't looking good, so it's likely to stay that way.)-The jokes get old after about the halfway point for me, so now that I know the plot goes nowhere there is really no reason to watch it again.I still recommend this series because it does such a good job portraying what...it's like to feel socially crippled... and for that I shall remember it fondly. it's like to feel socially crippled... and for that I shall remember it fondly."", 'No. 1: This is a GAG anime not a romantic comedy, This show really only can compare to Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh. Almost all other gag animes follow the 5 minute formula, but not WataMote,  Silver Link gambled on full length episodes adapted from what is essentially a bunch of one off comic strips. They weaved the jokes so seamlessly that viewers still believe there will be character development or an overarching story or ""plot"" when in reality, ""These are the jokes folks"" Tomoko won\'t be changing her formula any more than Dennis the Menace or Garfield will change theirs.When it comes to...music and sound there was no contest that season or even year. It\'s not even fair to gatchaman and danganronpa. All bow down before the mighty score and soundtrack of WataMote.  Every other episode we were treated to a special customized exit song by a popular band or musician. Even Kana Hanazawa and Hatsune Miku got in on the action. I mean come on!Regarding story I wouldn\'t call it a slice of life,it\'s more of a deconstructed slice of life. Tomoko is a big Japanese pop culture nerd, but none of her schemes ever match up to the fantasies of the light novels or videogames she uses for life manuals. This is where the humor stems from and it is unbelievable, after pausing the show for a few and bracing yourself, you will bust a gut. She\'s a big woobie always trying her best despite countless failures and this is what life really is, getting up and trying again, this makes her very relatable.The art really held its own. There wasn\'t any obvious production budget issues where you could tell it was rushed or they ran out of money. It was fairly consistent throughout. Some of my favorite details were the changing of the seasons, the sunsets, and the soul shattering revelation picassos.Fan service was high in areas of parody and homages, I believe there is a large wiki somewhere devoted to chronicling what shows were referenced. There was one scene where they beautifully mixed terra formars, haruhi and attack on titan all in one. The few ecchi scenes involving sexual harassment and her friend yu were clever and funny.This comedy is not for everyone, it is an acquired taste. I would call the humor in this series as the closest thing to high art there is in anime comedy. It is new, it is ugly, it is raw, it is scary, it is honest, it is relatable.

They’re shows that tell me, “We know you love this garbage. Remember to buy the blu-rays and any shit with their faces printed on it.” So when something comes along that doesn’t pander I’m caught off guard; something with a meaningful character I’m reminded that I’m still a person that just wants a connection to another human being. Tomoko, the main character, isn’t cute and she doesn’t do cute things. To put it gently… she’s a fucking loser.And I love...it.There’s a genre of humor called cringe comedy. A good example is The Office. It’s a type of humor where we watch characters get put into awkward situations. You’ll be embarrassed for them, but you’ll be glad they’re not you. Except, sometimes the circumstances will hit too close to home. You’ll get a little PTSD about high school (or the war). What happens to Tomoko will feel very familiar to a lot of you.That’s part of what I loved about the show. There are moments that will feel like it was lifted right out of somebody’s life—and it was! Apparently, the author took a lot of stories from her own school days. But what I loved more was how real Tomoko felt.She’s a disgusting, awkward, pretentious, lonely, procrastinating, daydreaming, petty, delusional nerd.I’ve got no complaints.

The series appears to be a sort of black comedy focusing on how pathetic, and sometimes selfish, Tomoko\'s character can be in regards of her perceptions to high school life based off her otome dating sim games that she is known to regularly playing and those perceptions getting shot down when she realizes things in reality don\'t play out as they do in her games. She\'s a social outcast, has a disheveled appearance, doesn\'t have very many...friends, gets nervous talking with those unfamiliar to her and has a rather rocky relationship with her family; with all of this played off for laughs and also being played as somewhat serious as a character exploration of Tomako having to look into her own personal flaws with why she doesn\'t get the reactions she would seek to get for her attempts at snagging popularity with the school student body.On the one hand, the premise for this is a unique one that shows some occasional wit as it believably portrays how a social outcast like Tomoko might perceive social situations based off any interest portraying a rather idealist take on reality (her dating sim games in this case) that isn\'t as what said interest perceives. On the other hand, the series lacks any gradual development in Tomoko\'s character as we don\'t know what led her to develop her present personality and habits, as well as any gradual changes to her character as she realizes the reality of the social situations she perceives. This does kill a bit of my interest in the title\'s premise as I would want to know more about Tomoko\'s character and see any gradual growth from her in order to better relate with her character. Instead we just see her mostly failing in her ventures and other than some occasions that hint to possible changes to come for Tomoko, there is very little for me to try caring for any possible chance at her changing for the better as the series seemed to delight more in tormenting her character.Visually, the series milks good use of its animation in depicting how flawed Tomoko\'s character is. Her character design is a unique one in that it isn\'t of the typical ""pretty girl"" variety seen from many recent titles as Tomoko is depicted with a frumpy and disheveled appearance, as well as show off some rather creepy and unsettling facial expressions depending on her emotional state. A number of visual gimmicks are portrayed to enhance major scenes depicting Tomoko\'s social isolation. While the series isn\'t on the visual scale of titles like Nagi no Asukara and Psycho-Pass that aired last year, it makes effective use of what it offers for its visual presentation and doesn\'t try going for elaborate animated sequences in its focus on Tomoko\'s isolation.While offering a unique premise for its comedy, Watamote suffers in the fact that it doesn\'t offer enough development in Tomoko\'s character to get the most potential out of its premise and for me to better relate to her character, instead seeming to relish in its torment of Tomoko for its comedy. Still, it would seem that there are those that like the unique direction of Watamote\'s comedy and have considered it one of 2013\'s top titles as a result of it.

People in the latter group will almost assuredly derive some pleasure (if only schadenfreude) from the show, but those in the former group may be put off by the frustration of what they are watching (some might find comedic value...in the show though).WATAMOTE's biggest weakness for me was the plot/story. It takes until the very end of the final episode for Tomoko to come to any substantial revelation about herself. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations based on previous anime tropes and stories. I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but if you expect or need significant character and/or story arcs this won't be the show for you.What WATAMOTE does right is the art and sound, which both perfectly fit the emotions and tone of the show. Both the art and sound help to reinforce Tomoko's personality and mood and add some much needed variety to each episode. Because explaining further would actually be spoilers to some of the best parts of the show, I'll leave it at that. Needless to say, you should enjoy the art and sound, I found them very polished as you would expect from a major studio.Overall, I gave this a 7/10 because the story was weak (and the show left me wanting), but the rest was very well executed. I enjoyed the series and was able to relate to Tomoko, but I really wanted to see something significant happen to her. If I had been thrown a bone and Tomoko had actually changed in some significant way, this show would easily have been an 8 or 9. Even so, I still recommend this show to fans of slice of life series. It's still an enjoyable ride. in the show though).WATAMOTE's biggest weakness for me was the plot/story.

I don\'t think you can find another equivalent series anywhere. (If there is, please tell me!) This series can be renamed ""Tomoko and her series of unfortunate events"". It seems like the whole world is against her in every corner that she turns. In other words, nothing seems to go well, ever. Although I was glad that there seemed to be a glimmer of light for her nearing the end of the series.Character: The first thing that attracted me to this series (and kept me watching)...was Tomoko. Although my own experiences may not be as dramatic, I found myself relating to her circumstances and empathising with her as she struggled through life. There are times when I hated having to form groups because I felt I never belonged anywhere. There are times when you see your friends developing and progressing at a rapid pace, leaving you behind in the dust. I love the peace of being alone, having my own me-time, but at the same time I worry that I\'m wasting my life away and will continue to be forever alone.Another character that I really liked was Tomoki. Or rather, I really liked the interactions between Tomoko and Tomoki. It\'s so cute how they look like each other (the eye bags thing must be genetic). I just don\'t understand why Tomoki never gave his sister any advice as he watched her ruin her own life.Story: This anime is one of a kind. I appreciated how Tomoko never really escaped from her plight because in reality it\'s just not that easy. I watched animes in which the female protagonist is plain, unsociable and awkward but a guy loves her for some reason. Because of that she blossoms into something beautiful. That is an enviable case which I really hope would happen in reality, but things don\'t always work out that way. But I\'m glad that Tomoko has one true friend in her life that truly cared for her and stuck with her no matter how weird her friend was. Sometimes we don\'t need many friends in life, we just need those few authentic gems who we find along our journey. I kind of wish her friend or brother or mother or SOMEBODY just told Tomoko the truth and guided her out of her doldrums. But then again, in a culture of politeness, criticism may not be as easy or natural. It reminded me that sometimes the people who say the cruel, cold, hard truth may really be the kindest of all.Music: I absolutely love the ending song. Kudos to Izumi Kitta for sounding like the most sloppy, drunk, crazy, messed up, psychotic girl ever. This is one out-of-tune song that\'s on the top of my songlist. Why? Because Tomoko\'s character shines from this song.Overall Enjoyment: I\'m not sadistic enough to say I enjoyed seeing Tomoko suffer, but I really liked the comedy behind the show and her very interesting thought process. That also made me realise that sometimes the way we view ourselves and the world around us can be really really wrong and we don\'t even realise it.So what exactly makes a person popular?

But there is one aspect of it I didnt enjoyed much, it is a bit depressing, some may find it comical the whole time, and sure there were parts I had some laughs because of the whole sillyness of it... this show is something not everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. In the end I came with mixed feelings about it...There isnt any...great story surround it, you can almost see the anime has episodic stories of the misfortunes, negativity and delusions of Tomoko. The existent story is used as a suport for that and that alone!So dont come to expect any story worth watching here.In terms of animation/art it is what I came to expect of anime nowadays, goings complete by the standarts of the industry, thus it fullfiled the goal of being watchable, of demonstrating the viewer Tomoko day to life, not excelling at anything.""The whole plot"" revolves around the MC Tomoko, being the rest, supportive cast, the main focus here will go to Tomoko, though I have to say some of the supportive cast has the potential to alone improve the series in the future by what I have seen at the end(will explain later on).Tomoko is a freshman on highshcool so you can expect to a certain degree of context stuff you have seen in other highschool\'s anime, here however, like I mentionated previously the nature of the athmosphere is far darker and much more delusional.Tomoko sees life and her surroundings in a very negative, depressive and delusional way, and that is where most of the comedy of the anime comes from, from all those weird actions and ""philosophys"" of Tomoko.Though I had enjoyed the character, especially in the beggining, it got a bit depressing and boring at parts... I pitied her!! It is like I wanted someone to come to her, and slap her, make her awake up a bit at least. Support her, this doesnt happens for the most of it, DAMM!!It is like everyone around her is blind and cant see that path destrutive of hers, that she always keeps walking, and this is when you need people around you yo help you and give you a reality check!!This is the nature of the series, it is what it is, some may like it more than others, it is not of my personnal taste, that is for sure!One of the best things about Watamote is the sound. The OP and END, have some nice music and creativity to it, they capture well the anime, and in episode 12, I have to say I enjoyed alot how they kicked the OP near the it.The studio animating this, Silver Link, surely deserve praise, they were really creative and I cant see how they could hd improved more on this aspect.I was already on episode 4, and I was getting mixed feelings about the series (though I was laughing alot at first..), it is always the same, every episode expect some kind of negativity from Tomoko about a topic, and in the end she just gets things in the wrong way AGAIN, and for me that cames to be frustating!! I want her to at least learn something, I m not even asking for her  to be more popular at the end of it! But maybe, maybe at least she cames to realise it a bit, she is at fault by her thinking! She should try to improve, so she can start to have some more ""light"" into the ""sea of darkness of negativity she lives into""... NOPE!!She ends just a tiny bit better than she began... Despite that, I had fun with the show, some of the negative stuff was soo wrong/weird, I found it really funny, and some stuff into this, already happened to anyone, so at least that is a connection the viewer can have with Tomoko!Also more to the end the series reveals more potential of how good could it be on the future, it is a shame it ended there!Overall, for me there is a good, and a bad way to enjoy this anime, it can be prettly enjoyable if you once in a while see 2-3 episodes, see the anime at the pace you feel you enjoy the most, no stress, or.... you marathoon IT!!Whole animes I liked so much that could have watch whole hours of them in a day, for weeks without getting bored because the whole thing was interesting, and these were lengthy ones, not 12 episode\'s anime, that if you enjoy that most, you just get ""the job done"" in less than a day, if you have free time for it.If I had marathoon this, I would had been crazy be the end of it, with all the negativity!Needless to say I keep it safe, from time to time, I watched some of it, and it was possible to find enjoyment in all the ""weirdness and bad jokes"" of Tomoko!!I understand well this is a satire, but it presents that kind of comedy I really dont enjoy that much, the plot can be shitty but if I can really enjoy the comedy, then it is fine by me.For this to get a better score, Tomoko would had to have more development, and the supportive cast should awake more to reality and see WTF is wrong with her!! (Deja vu!) One of my main complains, how the F#@5 dont they see she is in a destructive and misfortune behavior like that, even her\'s mother seems blind to it... anyway too biased, I know but it felt it could have been better, and with the little development at the end, the future looks promising to Tomoko!So before some people shit the anime, understand what it is, understand it is meaned to be like this be the author, and that is fine.

The manga, being compared to the anime, is classified mostly as comedy revolving around a lonely life, while the anime actually dives into the very real depression of exactly that. This anime is seen as extremely saddening, yet relatable to some, but heartwarming or comedic to others. Trying to be an optimist, I see it the second way. It\'s pretty uncommon when anime makes me laugh, but this one had me rolling. The comedic aspect of this also refers to the first way people see it, aka the relatability. I was laughing because Tomoko was...so relatable, her problems were extremely embarrassing, and having been through some of them myself the redness in my face was starting to grow from both laughing and embarrassment. But, even though this anime started out a comical comic, it turned into something dark, yet lesson teaching.Above all the terrible situations Tomoko has been through, one episode *cough* (Spoiler Alert) Episode 11 *cough* really showed that someone actually acknowledged Tomoko, and uses the age-old reassurer ""Someone out there likes you"" in a very heartwarming, beautiful, and tear-jerking way. Though the downfall of this anime was that it didn\'t have a second season to build on that.This is my first review, hope I did well! so relatable, her problems were extremely embarrassing, and having been through some of them myself the redness in my face was starting to grow from both laughing and embarrassment.

My friend told me that the opening song was really good and now I agree with him. The Japanese voice acting is good. I like Tomoko\'s voice, it fits her very well. There was also one ending where there was a Hatsune Miku song and I was so happy.~Characters~There are some characters that their names are never mentioned, but that wouldn\'t bother anyone.

If you are you'll probably find yourself being highly let down and pessimistic during most of the anime, but if you are a forgiving anime watcher, then I highly implore you give this anime a chance.Story-The story is generally pretty basic with a narrow storyline, of which serves as no more than a guideline for the character tomoki. Since this anime is -dare i say it- a slice of life the story is actually pretty small within each episode. Its fair enough of though, earning a solid 6\\1O.Art-The artwork is...mostly centralized on portraying tomoki's awkward, hermit-like appearance, and it is spot on. The other characters are generally generic, but they play very little roles anyway. Also their is a lot of cartoon style artwork for comedic relief, and it does do well for shits and giggles. A strong 9\\1O.Sound-Their isn't even much sound thorought the anime, but the angst ridden pop-metalcore intro is really badass. The outro is pretty good too, due to tomokis terrible but kawaii singing. Seriously, it makes me shrivel with its levels of kawaii. sound is a 9\\1O.Character-The character is really the meat and potatos of this anime, and the only part that actually matters. Their is not much character outside of tomokis because the other characters are explored little. So, on that note, what about tomoki? Initially tomoki is really pitiful, pathetic, overall just really dissapointing. She squanders every oppurtunity to make friends and escape her cage. Plus, many of the situations in which she creates are so awkward they make you cringe. The writer obviously did not see the fine line between relatable humor and highly uncomfortable situations. However, there is a lot of funny brother sister moments that kind of alleviate this, but only somewhat. Despite this kind of back and forth rollercoaster the ending is highly redeeming as tomoki finally accepts herself and is happy with herself for all of the socially awkward teen she is. The ending is a little bittersweet as she doesnt ever make any freinds but as long as your still positive and hopeful (which will be a task) you'll see a lot of fullfillment in this and just...relief. Tomoki's character is a rollercoaster and for that, i'll give it a 7\\1O.Enjoyment-Its kind of muddled between shits and giggles laughter and cringeworthy awkwardness, so i'll only give it a 6\\1O.Overall-In the end the anime redeems itself, coming to a bittersweet conclusion after just constant an endless battering of confusion and dissapointment (of which is broken up with real comedy occasionaly.) i recommend you watch it and form your own conclusions, because it really is an anime that divides people. for me it, i give it a 7\\1O, but again, you may love it or hate it. mostly centralized on portraying tomoki's awkward, hermit-like appearance, and it is spot on.

I was definitively pleased with it. I know some found the characterization of the main character to be excessive or even very cringy at moments, and it would be a lie to said it wasn\'t. But I believe it\'s what makes the main character so interesting. Specially when you feel a bit like she does.Tomoko Kuroki is that young girl that goes to school like everyone else, but somehow she\'s a master in making all things awkward. I must admit that I did enjoy going through this anime...seeing her ""madness"" (at this point, it\'s pretty fair to call that madness) affect her and her surroundings. Somehow, I could understand how she felt and why she was trying to hard.Watamote is a wonderfull depiction (more like a caricature) of the pressure teenagers (with mental issues) live in highschool. The moment you get into the crazy story of this girl, you simply can\'t get out! seeing her ""madness"" (at this point, it\'s pretty fair to call that madness) affect her and her surroundings.

The moment you get into the crazy story of this girl, you simply can\'t get out!', 'Watamote, an anime put under the subcategory of ""humor"", may have accomplished that title. However, we all understand that it is so much more than that - it was written as a slice of life anime for all of the loners, wallflowers, awkward kids and general outcasts of the world. To anyone else, this anime would be quickly dismissed, and the main character would be seen as too artificial, unchanging and improbably far gone as a person. However, especially for the group it\'s trying to appeal to, it targets deep subconscious emotions and memories of our past and present, granting us with a powerful sense...of catharsis. We feel her as a blurred reflection of ourselves when we stare into the mirror at our broken figures.As a character, I would give her almost a perfect score for these reasons. However, as I stated, her inability to evolve and grow as a character makes the anime a little painful to watch. You sit there twiddling your thumbs, gripping your thigh, waiting for the sweet release of tension as Tomoko accomplishes feats or gets bits of luck. Don\'t hold your breath though, the manga is very similar to the anime in the sense of those characteristics. Personally, I am someone who enjoys watching animes that are unchanging and not very concerned about plots because they feel more authentic and realistic. As a slice of life anime, it achieved its sole purpose and recognizes that we, as people, take ages to evolve into anything besides what we are used to.The animation style has some seriously unique traits - the characters that are irrelevant are typically given grey silhouettes as to divert focus away from them. Typically, it\'s done to classmates, but when Tomoko feels irrelevant, the shadow is passed onto her instead. One other interesting trait is how the characters are not always drawn with eyes, as to display how their individuality and uniqueness are severely limited - a trait that is seen as passed onto boring, superficial characters with no backstories.All in all, Watamote is an anime that requires the individual watching it to fit their target audience, in order for one to enjoy it. Reasons being is that it lacks plot, does not evolve and is impossible to get through an episode without feeling vicarious embarrassment from her awkward encounters. On the other hand, the feeling of being able to sympathize with Tomoko provides a beautiful sense of catharsis. It is wonderfully written in the number of relatable situations they provide you with. It\'s a true story of fighting and willingness for achieving acceptance, but lets you down much as real life does. But perhaps Tomoko is not as unfortunate as she personally believes, as many characters will express interest in her when she does not notice.This is an anime you must decide beforehand whether you fit the criteria of their target audience, because this is not an anime where ratings drift around the mean, but rather one where you either love it or you hate it. You\'ll either be sick of it by episode 3, or determined to keep coming back for more. of catharsis. We feel her as a blurred reflection of ourselves when we stare into the mirror at our broken figures.As a character, I would give her almost a perfect score for these reasons. However, as I stated, her inability to evolve and grow as a character makes the anime a little painful to watch. You sit there twiddling your thumbs, gripping your thigh, waiting for the sweet release of tension as Tomoko accomplishes feats or gets bits of luck. Don\'t hold your breath though, the manga is very similar to the anime in the sense of those characteristics.

I really enjoyed it purely because it reflects the struggles and the story of a shy, easily embarrassed girl dealing with a form of social anxiety. It shows the amount of stress high school seems to put her through, and some parts of the anime make you feel much sympathy for the main character, yet other parts make you laugh. I'd say that this anime contains an assortment of funny moments and all sad (ish) moments.I highly recommend this anime to anyone...who is looking for a unique anime to really reflect on. However, the only disappointment in the story is that the development of the story is severely lacking. Despite this, the story is very easy to follow but it often repeats itself. Not only that, the character development on the main protagonist is very good, because we are able to see her innermost emotions throughout every situation.I really did enjoy this anime because the art is very unique and the sound was good. As well as that, some people may not like this factor, but there were quite a few characters, but not loads like many other animes. This was something that I liked because it meant that the plot was very easy to follow and it also meant that not many of the characters would intefere with the struggles of each individual. who is looking for a unique anime to really reflect on.

The story follows Tomoko and her escapades to become popular and overcome anxiety. Antics ensue. As a character, Tomoko is somewhat likeable, as you can't help but hope that she succeeds in her endeavors, but the ways she gets herself into situations almost makes her deserve it.The art is good. I especially like the exaggerated lighting and character redesigns during the daydream sequences.The sound is good. The ending songs and the songs near the end are really awesome. Though, the opening can get some getting used to, as it doesn't really fit the tone of the show. The soundtrack...isn't really noticable unless its the highlight of a certain scene, but its adequate. I can't really preach for the voice acting, since I watched the sub.My enjoyment of this was great!Overall, Watamote is a sad story told in a comedic way, and it has really good comedy (why wouldn't it, its a comedy show). There are some touching moments. But, not everyone will like this show. There are some serious cringy moments, and if you haven't watched a lot of anime then some references will go over your head. I personally cringed as much as I laughed, however, not everyone will do the same. If you don't like the first episode, then don't watch as the others are basically along the same lines.

Happy anime watching!"", ""Absent of consistent tone but with some great moments. Watamote follows the life of an extreme social outcast. Whilst I myself am not the most socially literate being, I found myself unable to relate to nearly anything in the show. It is actually rather depressing to watch as a girl who clearly is beyond the normal level of social awkwardness isn't given any help by her parents, brother or classmates, making the show rather mean-spirited.Is a depressing show about the life of a shut in automatically a bad thing? No. But Watamote doesn't resolve any of the issues in the show, nor does it have...enough depth about the issues it is raising about social isolation. Instead, the show tries to be a comedy, and whilst some moments are very funny, the show is simply too dark and depressing to be watching for comedic purposes. If I want to watch a comedic slice of life show about slightly socially awkward girls, the anime world has me covered. If I want to watch a depressing slice of reality, the anime world also has me covered. Watamote is split between two genres that just don't meld together very easily.I understand that the show has continuation in the form of manga, but the 12 episode anime just doesn't have any form of satisfying conclusion and falls into the trap of the dreaded unresolved 12 episode anime menace. A strong conclusion or some character development could have made this show go from a 5/10 to potentially a 10/10.  But put quite simply, unless you are planning on continuing the show through the manga, there is no reason to view this show. It will only leave you with an empty feeling.If the purpose of the show was to make the audience laugh at Tomoko, it doesn't work, I only feel sorry for her. If it was to relate to her, then perhaps she could have been made slightly less pathetic. If it was for catharsis, perhaps the show should have continued to the point of having a satisfying pay off. None of these things are really achieved. The one good point I will make about the show is the way the art and anime medium is used for effect, with Tomoko's emotions being portrayed in many creative visual ways.Overall I give the show a 5/10. I would not recommend it unless you like shows that do nothing but depress and anger you. There is much wasted potential here and I partially blame the standardized 12 episode format for that. This anime needed to be longer so the character development could kick in. Nothing is achieved in this anime by the protagonist.

After 6 episodes of my heart being pulled through my stomach, I dropped it. This shit could be a form of psychological warfare. It\'s so painful.Don\'t get me wrong- the quality is there. The show is serviceable in all aspects. It just feels intentionally horrific. This show is labelled as a comedy, but it\'s not. It isn\'t funny. It just hurts. Tomoko is a terrible person in an unfortunate circumstance. You\'re torn between wanting to root for her and wanting her to wake up from her delusion.I liked the show- sort of....I never wanted to watch it, but I always wanted to know how it was going to end. Unfortunately, WataMote was a show that completely defeated my heart. If you\'re up for the challenge, give WataMote a shot. I never wanted to watch it, but I always wanted to know how it was going to end. Unfortunately, WataMote was a show that completely defeated my heart. If you\'re up for the challenge, give WataMote a shot.', 'Watamote has left me feeling incredibly...strange.After a few episodes, I had to pause and reflect upon what I had just seen, and how it felt way too real. So many times when I see anime, I expect a story that has a happy ending, or at least will make me smile. You expect all the ends to be tied up nice, and to be left with a positive feeling toward the end of a show.Watamote doesn\'t do that. That is to the show\'s benefit, however.Watamote is an anime about a young girl named Tomoko transitioning from Middle School to high School, and how she...is attempting to overcome her strong social anxiety to have the best High School experience ever. Every time Tomoko attempts to step out of her funk, however, she is met with another mental battle...Usually leading to a failure.First, let me say that Watamote is hard to review; at times, it hard to watch. If you do not sympathize with the lead or at least understand what she is going through, then I can totally understand why a lot of this anime can come off as mean-spirited or cruel. This is MY review, however, and honestly no matter how I look at Watamote, I love it. It made me uncomfortable, it hurt to watch, and it broke me at points...and I loved every bit of it. I have a personal love for this anime, and earnestly believe it is an amazing anime. I HAD to put myself in Tomoko\'s shoes because I have gone through what she has; if you have trouble putting yourself in Tomoko\'s shoes, you probably aren\'t going to enjoy this anime.I know this show is described as a comedy, and while it did make me laugh quite a bit with how relatable and silly some of the scenarios were, I honestly found myself holding back tears most of the time. I wouldn\'t call this anime a comedy, unless you want to compare your life to Tomoko\'s and realize how better your own life is. Some people do genuinely doing that, but from my perspective I have been in most of Tomoko\'s situations. I\'ve passed out in school because I have anemia, I ate alone in the bathroom with my 3DS so no one would bother me, and I hated people in High school. I completely understand Tomoko\'s train of thought. I now know a lot of what I did in High school was pretty cringeworthy, which made watching Tomoko experience the same things all the more sad, and painful...but completely understandable. Simply put, Tomoko wants to be accepted. Sometimes, when you want something enough, you are willing to do anything to achieve it. Tomoko\'s drive to want something better for her life is what kept me watching the anime, but it was the inevitable failures of her plans to succeed that made me want to mute my computer volume, and leave in a broken heap.Is that a bad thing? Not to me. I found this show so relatable, it allowed me to look at my own short comings, and how I want to change for the better.Tomoko does do some stupid things, and she does put herself in some rotten positions. Despite how much I love Tomoko, to say that she didn\'t deserve a lot of what was going to happen to her for doing stupid things would be a lie. Isn\'t that the point of this anime though? ""Social anxiety can make some of us do crazy things, and those crazy things usually don\'t mix well with the real world."" This anime see\'s a problem, social anxiety, and decided to play it straight without any over simplified lens. I think it did a spectacular job at shining a light on an often over-looked issue. Is that light really bright? Yes, but why should something as crippling as social anxiety be toned down? Simply because it makes some people uncomfortable? Social anxiety itself makes thousands of people uncomfortable every day; if you are made uncomfortable because you are the one being laughed from Tomoko\'s point of view in this anime, imagine being a person who has gone through something like this. It isn\'t pretty, and this show does a good job representing that.Tomoko has her own thought process, mixed with pessimism, cockiness and social anxiety, that usually wind her up in hot water. I do believe the situations she finds herself in allowed Tomoko to grow, not much, but grow some toward the end of the series; especially during the cultural festival.Tomoko also does have a lot of people that care about her; her cousin Kii, her friend Yu, her brother Tomoki, and the student council president Megumi Imae. Also, not every situation Tomoko is in is horrible. Tomoko does see some success; and when that happens you cheer right along with her.In the end, I think Watamote is an amazing anime, and something that really stands out in terms of plot, and character development. I had an amazing time watching Watamote, I got invested in Tomoko\'s situations, and her daily life.

As always I'm working from the dub version, so keep that in mind. I stumbled across this title basically on accident, and I can't believe I nearly missed such an utterly awesome show! So if you wanna go 'blind' from here, I TOTALLY thumbs up this one! Hell there may even be a new entry on the RTLR wall of awkwardness! I'm not popular, so let's talk this one up!As a side note, this is review 64, falling right near my one year anniversary of writing reviews. I know some of my...earlier works were pretty cringeworthy, but I hope I've grown and become better for you guys. I know that all of the support and advice I've been given is greatly appreciated. So thank you, yes you, I can see you there, for taking time out of your day to read these reviews. I'm very humbled.Story: 9The story for Watamote at first doesn't seem like anything to write home about, but then the comedy bits start hitting and we go from zero to hilarious in no time flat. The show revolves around a socially inept girl who is trying to break out of her shell and become popular, or at least have more than one friend. She's a total badass in her own mind, but has social anxiety so badly she can barely speak to any other person outside her family. She has an inflated ego, and expects the world sometimes, and the hijinks that leads to her eventual failures are just awesomely funny. With each episode, she decides to tackle a new angle to try to increase her social standing, and oddly none of them include, you know, learning to talk to people. In one show she might decide to attend a fireworks festival and try to win over some friends there, only to have it backfire completely on her. Other times she might attempt putting on airs, or doing any number of things which just leads her to even more crashing and burning.The show has a definite slice of life appeal to it, in that the events and actions the main girl takes fall in line with that genre, but it's a bit of a twisted parody of the SoL category. In her own mind, our MC thinks she's the coolest damn thing since sliced bread, but just for the life of her totally shuts down when she tries to enact her latest plan to become popular. There are even several moments where the fourth wall is broken and the MC makes a remark like 'this isn't an anime show' when duh, clearly it is. They also do a fairly subtle poke at SoL shows with her seat in high school. Watch many SoL's and you'll find that the primary characters almost always sit towards the back of the row, on the row closest to the window. For part of the show, the MC sits in that same cliched spot, but then she's thrown by a seating change into the middle of the classroom near the front. I thought it was a funny jab at the trope of having everyone important by the windows in school. There's lots of little nods like that, serving to poke fun at the genre and even the show itself.While the story ranks high, it's not because of the SoL stylings, it's because of her copious amounts of internal dialog where she's so jacked up on being cool ramming headlong into her extreme lack of social graces. She'll have an internal monologue about how she's got this shit in her latest plan, only to speak to another person and say nothing but 'uh, yeah, well' and then run away as fast as possible. She then berates herself, and even mocks others when she's safely away. She seems to be nearly completely clueless on why she's such a misfit, but in such a way as to skewer the ever-present 'clueless' girl found in damn near every SoL series. I guess this is why the show is called 'No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Unpopular!' No matter how she goes about it, she only seems peripherally aware of her own shortcomings, which makes her falling flat on her face even funnier.The parody elements ring very close to the kinds of things found in shows like Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, which is interesting, as in the dubbed version, both the MC of Watamote and Stocking from PS&G are played by the same voice actress. This show also reminds me strongly of Detroit Metal City, in that if you can't take a joke, and even laugh a little at yourself at times, then you should seriously pass.Art: 10There's this problem in a lot of anime when it comes to portraying 'plain' looking girls. Sukitte Ii na yo (Say I Love You) comes immediately to mind, in that the primary female was supposed to be 'average' looking at best but was still cute as a button. Watamote does not make this mistake. By giving the MC and even her little brother ever present dark circles under their eyes, and portraying them with a bit of unkempt hair, they do nail the 'ugly' girl look, which in and of itself is adorable too, but it fits the story far better than most 'plain jane' types found in other shows.The usual comedy artwork is present, as one would expect from such a show. The other girls drawn in the series are made to be incredibly pretty, accentuating the odd looks of the MC. The art is interesting and works well for the theme of the show.Sound: 9As I said, the MC is also the actress that voiced Stocking, and Stocking was my favorite character from PS&G so I squealed with delight the first time she spoke. That actress has amazing comedic timing, and is able to really draw one in with the use of tone, inflection, and volume in her voice. I don't think they could have cast the MC any more perfectly in the dub than what they did, it's totally awesome.The little brother sounds good too, he is basically constantly annoyed by the MC's insistence on sharing her plans for popular domination with him. He really does sound like a real brother would, as interested in her crap as a rock, and endlessly pissed that she keeps pestering him.The other main cast member, a friend from the MC's middle school days, has a sweet, very typical 'anime' voice, and would fit in well in any SoL type show you wanted to slap her in. Again this juxtaposition just serves to heighten the comedic factor.The themes, holy shit, the opener is awesome. When it came to metal-ish openers I didn't think any series would be able to replace Detroit Metal City's opening but Watamote totally did. It's a hard driving song and I think it fits the form and functionality of the show completely. The closer is far less hardcore, but is catchy in its own way, and I will listen to both outside of watching the show.Character: 8The MC is a blast, as I'm sure I've already made apparent, but the slight knock comes from the ever-sweet best friend who now attends a different high school, but still tries to support the MC. She was a mousy nerd like the MC but she blossomed as she entered high school and became all popular and is now the total opposite of what she was, and what the MC still is. She's not a bad character, she's just a bit flat and one dimensional. Although she's the only non family member that the MC can actually communicate with. She seems to exist mainly as a point of jealousy for the MC, and to misunderstand and laugh at the MC's various hijinks.The little brother character is a bit flat too, as he has one emotion: annoyed. Now I have siblings, and they all have more than one child in their families, and they do really nail the little brother's pissy attitude, but we never see any further sides of his personality.The MC is a super blast, being the biggest of nerds, saying the funniest shit, and totally just being as weird as possible. As the synopsis says, she's played countless visual novels and video games so she should be completely prepared and suave when it comes down to real life, but she just can't get it done. I really identify with her completely. I've never tried to hide the fact I'm bipolar, and I suffer from a severe enough case that the government has declared me disabled, and I totally am just like the MC in social situations. I stammer, I forget what to say, how to act, and just end up coming across weird, yet in my head, and strangely behind a keyboard on the net, I'm totally rocking this shit, baby. That's why the MC speaks to me so well, I know exactly what it's like to be like she is. The show is funny to even 'normal' people, but for us awkward nerds, there's even more comedy built in because we can identify with her issues. This gives her character a 'real world' feel.There's not much else cast wise, we hear from the siblings mother on occasion, but basically other than characters popping up for only a moment or two, we mainly have the big three there. This focus might be a little tight, and I think maybe having expanded the cast by a member or two could have worked out. Not a real complaint, but a thought nonetheless.Enjoyment: 9I laughed so much watching this show my sides hurt. I love how they poke fun at anime tropes, at socially inept nerds, and at highschool life in general. I really looked forward to watching each episode, and am now kind of sad that I've seen them all. I'd love a second season, but I don't think that's in the cards, sadly. I have no problem laughing at myself and some of the ridiculous things I do, which I think is one of the main selling points of this series. Don't take it seriously, just roll with the laughter and revel as the MC faceplants over and over again, and I think you'll be eager to see more just the same as I was.Best Girl: Even if the cast was bigger, there's only one answer here, the MC Tomoko. She's freaking awesome, and damn near one of the coolest females in all anime if you ask me. The voice actress played her with aplomb, the writers gave her awesome jokes and observations, and the artists gave her a unique look you're not likely to forget. She's just the shit guys, seriously.And of all surprises, Tomoko makes the RTLR wall of nerdhood, the first entry to score a spot in several reviews. Sorry Wonder Woman, but you've got to go, I've found someone better for your spot. This was such a fun show and I'm so damn glad I stumbled across it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Even if you are popular. I'm on the way to finding my way. Thanks again for reading these reviews guys, and here's to another year of my meandering ramblings, hopefully. Cheers! earlier works were pretty cringeworthy, but I hope I've grown and become better for you guys. I know that all of the support and advice I've been given is greatly appreciated. So thank you, yes you, I can see you there, for taking time out of your day to read these reviews.

In her own mind, our MC thinks she's the coolest damn thing since sliced bread, but just for the life of her totally shuts down when she tries to enact her latest plan to become popular. There are even several moments where the fourth wall is broken and the MC makes a remark like 'this isn't an anime show' when duh, clearly it is. They also do a fairly subtle poke at SoL shows with her seat in high school. Watch many SoL's and you'll find that the primary characters almost always sit towards the back of the row, on the row closest to the window. For part of the show, the MC sits in that same cliched spot, but then she's thrown by a seating change into the middle of the classroom near the front. I thought it was a funny jab at the trope of having everyone important by the windows in school. There's lots of little nods like that, serving to poke fun at the genre and even the show itself.While the story ranks high, it's not because of the SoL stylings, it's because of her copious amounts of internal dialog where she's so jacked up on being cool ramming headlong into her extreme lack of social graces. She'll have an internal monologue about how she's got this shit in her latest plan, only to speak to another person and say nothing but 'uh, yeah, well' and then run away as fast as possible. She then berates herself, and even mocks others when she's safely away. She seems to be nearly completely clueless on why she's such a misfit, but in such a way as to skewer the ever-present 'clueless' girl found in damn near every SoL series. I guess this is why the show is called 'No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Unpopular!' No matter how she goes about it, she only seems peripherally aware of her own shortcomings, which makes her falling flat on her face even funnier.The parody elements ring very close to the kinds of things found in shows like Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, which is interesting, as in the dubbed version, both the MC of Watamote and Stocking from PS&G are played by the same voice actress. This show also reminds me strongly of Detroit Metal City, in that if you can't take a joke, and even laugh a little at yourself at times, then you should seriously pass.Art: 10There's this problem in a lot of anime when it comes to portraying 'plain' looking girls. Sukitte Ii na yo (Say I Love You) comes immediately to mind, in that the primary female was supposed to be 'average' looking at best but was still cute as a button. Watamote does not make this mistake. By giving the MC and even her little brother ever present dark circles under their eyes, and portraying them with a bit of unkempt hair, they do nail the 'ugly' girl look, which in and of itself is adorable too, but it fits the story far better than most 'plain jane' types found in other shows.The usual comedy artwork is present, as one would expect from such a show. The other girls drawn in the series are made to be incredibly pretty, accentuating the odd looks of the MC. The art is interesting and works well for the theme of the show.Sound: 9As I said, the MC is also the actress that voiced Stocking, and Stocking was my favorite character from PS&G so I squealed with delight the first time she spoke. That actress has amazing comedic timing, and is able to really draw one in with the use of tone, inflection, and volume in her voice. I don't think they could have cast the MC any more perfectly in the dub than what they did, it's totally awesome.The little brother sounds good too, he is basically constantly annoyed by the MC's insistence on sharing her plans for popular domination with him. He really does sound like a real brother would, as interested in her crap as a rock, and endlessly pissed that she keeps pestering him.The other main cast member, a friend from the MC's middle school days, has a sweet, very typical 'anime' voice, and would fit in well in any SoL type show you wanted to slap her in. Again this juxtaposition just serves to heighten the comedic factor.The themes, holy shit, the opener is awesome. When it came to metal-ish openers I didn't think any series would be able to replace Detroit Metal City's opening but Watamote totally did. It's a hard driving song and I think it fits the form and functionality of the show completely. The closer is far less hardcore, but is catchy in its own way, and I will listen to both outside of watching the show.Character: 8The MC is a blast, as I'm sure I've already made apparent, but the slight knock comes from the ever-sweet best friend who now attends a different high school, but still tries to support the MC. She was a mousy nerd like the MC but she blossomed as she entered high school and became all popular and is now the total opposite of what she was, and what the MC still is. She's not a bad character, she's just a bit flat and one dimensional. Although she's the only non family member that the MC can actually communicate with. She seems to exist mainly as a point of jealousy for the MC, and to misunderstand and laugh at the MC's various hijinks.The little brother character is a bit flat too, as he has one emotion: annoyed. Now I have siblings, and they all have more than one child in their families, and they do really nail the little brother's pissy attitude, but we never see any further sides of his personality.The MC is a super blast, being the biggest of nerds, saying the funniest shit, and totally just being as weird as possible. As the synopsis says, she's played countless visual novels and video games so she should be completely prepared and suave when it comes down to real life, but she just can't get it done. I really identify with her completely. I've never tried to hide the fact I'm bipolar, and I suffer from a severe enough case that the government has declared me disabled, and I totally am just like the MC in social situations. I stammer, I forget what to say, how to act, and just end up coming across weird, yet in my head, and strangely behind a keyboard on the net, I'm totally rocking this shit, baby. That's why the MC speaks to me so well, I know exactly what it's like to be like she is. The show is funny to even 'normal' people, but for us awkward nerds, there's even more comedy built in because we can identify with her issues. This gives her character a 'real world' feel.There's not much else cast wise, we hear from the siblings mother on occasion, but basically other than characters popping up for only a moment or two, we mainly have the big three there. This focus might be a little tight, and I think maybe having expanded the cast by a member or two could have worked out. Not a real complaint, but a thought nonetheless.Enjoyment: 9I laughed so much watching this show my sides hurt. I love how they poke fun at anime tropes, at socially inept nerds, and at highschool life in general. I really looked forward to watching each episode, and am now kind of sad that I've seen them all. I'd love a second season, but I don't think that's in the cards, sadly. I have no problem laughing at myself and some of the ridiculous things I do, which I think is one of the main selling points of this series. Don't take it seriously, just roll with the laughter and revel as the MC faceplants over and over again, and I think you'll be eager to see more just the same as I was.Best Girl: Even if the cast was bigger, there's only one answer here, the MC Tomoko. She's freaking awesome, and damn near one of the coolest females in all anime if you ask me. The voice actress played her with aplomb, the writers gave her awesome jokes and observations, and the artists gave her a unique look you're not likely to forget. She's just the shit guys, seriously.And of all surprises, Tomoko makes the RTLR wall of nerdhood, the first entry to score a spot in several reviews. Sorry Wonder Woman, but you've got to go, I've found someone better for your spot. This was such a fun show and I'm so damn glad I stumbled across it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Even if you are popular. I'm on the way to finding my way. Thanks again for reading these reviews guys, and here's to another year of my meandering ramblings, hopefully. Cheers!"", 'f**k this anime, Watamote is one of the most uncomfortable experiences I\'ve had while watching not only an anime, but a tv show in general. Tomoko is one of the most unlikeable characters I\'ve ever seen in an anime, she\'s a terrible person, there is no way around it, she is the worst girl, she\'s lazy, ignorant, rude, unpleasant, and socially incompetent. why anyone would consider her to be the ""best girl"" I have no idea, she isn\'t good she\'s just, pathetic, everything in this anime is pathetic (except the soundtrack, it\'s surprisingly good), the animation is standard for an anime, altho it can look...really good at times, but the CGI, no, the CGI is dreadful, especially that one scene in the last episode, it physically hurt my eyes. The story is... there\'s a girl who wants to be popular, but she can\'t because like I said she\'s socially incompetent, really? just really? I ended up being bored for around 60% of this anime, 38% being uncomfortable, and the last 2% actually being entertained. In my opinion, you should really stay away from this anime and stick with... anything else, it isn\'t the worst anime of all time but it isn\'t good, at all. really good at times, but the CGI, no, the CGI is dreadful, especially that one scene in the last episode, it physically hurt my eyes.

Watamote is one of the most self-aware anime I've seen, showing moments from childhood that we casually gloss over to the thoughts we normally don't say out loud. I can guarantee you, this is not just a funny dark-humored anime, this is a wake up call.It follows Tomoko through a simple plot: trying every possible way to become popular, except she's too solipsistic to fix her own outlook on her peers before materialistic things like looks or cute clothes. A reality check for arrogant people. She is timid and...has a habit of viewing other girls as sluts. I can relate this to other great shows like Breaking Bad or Death Note: the main characters are all misogynistic losers, so the female characters are portrayed through their lens. The sexualization in Watamote is exaggerated because most of that shit didn't really happen the same way, just Tomoko being afraid and/or perverted. If you view the female characters like Skyler, Misa, and Yuu as annoying sluts, you've fallen for their arrogance.  I know this was intentional because the female characters that are sexualized are the ones that Tomoko views as popular, not those like her mother and Kuroki herself.The sound is great. It opens with a kickass metal opening that describes exactly what Tomoko and unpopular kids are feeling. Angry, trying endlessly to no avail. Wanting to be popular but wanting to be alone at the same time. Same with the main ending (there are multiple, even a Vocaloid ending), but more sad. From Tomoko's quivering voice, she describes feeling that her attempts at socialization are futile. The sound effects add a lot of comedic effect too.The visuals that go along with this are also good. I may be a bit biased for the 2010 anime art style, but it shows that Tomoko can be cute sometimes, but that won't make her popular. Tomoko's expressions are honestly hilarious. Good character design for Tomoko too, although there is a very small cast.The cast is small but not exactly limited. This is the reality that Kuroki goes through on a daily basis: same routine, same people. But you can do a lot with such little characters; sometimes it's better to have a cast that you can get familiar with easily.(Spoilers of the ending from this point onward)Many people were displeased with the ending of the show because of the lack of character development, but I think Watamote gets the point across fine without Kuroki drastically changing. It shows Tomoki, Imae, and Naruse winning at life while Tomoko is stuck wielding a perverted loser mindset. It's funny as hell with the music playing, maybe not the most satisfying ending, but not all stories have or have to have happy endings.Overall, best and most relatable slice of life in my opinion, and one of the funniest too. It's not necessary, but it would be cool to get a season 2 or at least another OVA. has a habit of viewing other girls as sluts.

She had high expectations for her first year of high school, but things do not seem to go as planned. She has trouble to talking to people and is also generally ignored by the populace. Whenever someone does try to talk to her, outside of her immediate family, she gets incredibly nervous and shy. The show revolves around her attempts to increase her popularity...at High School so she can meet new friends, get a boyfriend, and enjoy her High School years.While this may sound like an interesting underdog story, it has quite a few downsides.Tomoko receives little character development in this character story. She becomes less nervous talking to people, and gains a little confidence, but never actually develops in a meaningful way.Her character and her goals also are a little inconsistent. In the first half of the story (Roughly episodes 1-7), one of her primary goals is to get guys to notice and/or like her. It makes sense since her character is written to be extremely sexualized, with even a fantasy scene in one of the first few episodes of her being gang-raped. However, after the 7th episode, she seems to be more interested in getting the attention of girls and even comes across as a bit of a lesbian. This comes out of nowhere and seems kind of odd.She also seems to be disinterested in getting a boyfriend and more interested in just finding friends but in the first half of the series, she liked being alone generally but was really looking to find a guy. Yeah sure, she always wanted attention, but seemed to have switched from primarily male to primarily female towards the second part of the series.The Story was deliberately written in the way of not having plot progression. There were many chances for the writer to take the story down an interesting path, only to have it dropped or ruined by the main character who pushes the bounds of suspension of disbelief. The story has no ending, despite building up to one, and the only closure the series has is a vague ""Who cares, be happy with yourself.""I held Tomoko in various states of like and dislike depending upon her actions, situation, and setting. She is a sympathetic character, someone who we\'ve all been to some extent and someone who we\'d all want to help. She also can be selfish, mean and weird. However, I believe the audience wanted to see her ultimately succeed and towards the end, it seems that she might get what she actually wants. The opportunity for a happy ending is ruined by, in my opinion, a poorly taught lesson used as an excuse to show some panties and jiggling breasts.Saying all I have said, the writer is  skilled at writing characters, and the support characters are surprisingly normal when compared to Tomoko and that was a great juxtaposition. The story is well connected, with characters coming back in later episodes, and the episode ideas were interesting enough that it was a hard series to put down. Tomoko is sympathetic, her brother is a realistic example of a sibling, her middle school friend was genuine and at the end, it seems someone actually notices her. It played out fairly realistically and if it wasn\'t for the writer snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, it would have been a satisfying tale. However it didn\'t, so it\'s just an okay series.I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone who hasn\'t watched anime at all though. There was fair too many anime culture references, specifically from the Haruhi series. I noticed an Another reference as well. I probably didn\'t get all the references myself, so it\'s probably a series best left to watching later. I think people who have watched more anime than myself might have found find it funnier.All in all, I am giving it a 6. If this series had followed a more stereotypical story arc within it\'s context, it could have been great.

We follow Kuroki Tomoko, a 15 year-old shut-in who is entering her first year of high school and makes it her master plan to become popular and enjoy her high school life surrounded by friends and admirers... Needless to say, absolutely nothing goes her way, and Tomoko oftentimes unintentionally puts herself into some of the most painfully embarrassing...situations I\'ve witnessed in a piece of entertainment, and these situations are the only real downside to this anime. I found a select few to be amusing, but the majority of these embarrassments made me feel quite uncomfortable. Where I found the story shined instead were the moments where Tomoko was alone to her thoughts. The viewers really get a feeling for how she thinks and operates, which works very well in an anime in which we\'re pretty much following a single character throughout the whole thing. WataMote also seems to really enjoy getting our hopes up for something to finally go Tomoko\'s way, only to flip that hope completely on its head as if it were mocking us for wanting her to magically have something work out for her, because folks, let me tell ya; that ain\'t how things work in the real world.Art - 8/10I enjoyed the art-style to WataMote. Two highlights to point out are Tomoko\'s character design and the lighting. Tomoko\'s design stuck out to me because we aren\'t often given a character who looks visibly downtrodden and disheveled 95% of their time on screen. This adds a lot to the realism of her character. The lighting also caught my interest because it isn\'t something normally done. Usually, in other anime, scenes are lit quite smoothly. However, in WataMote, sources of light produce shapes of color that give the aesthetic of the anime a lot of character.Sound - 8/10I love the opening and main ending theme! Both of them feel very unique in their own regards. The opening, for example, both fits the show perfectly and doesn\'t fit it at all at the same time. On one hard, it is an exposition of Tomoko\'s inner frustration and anger towards the world. On the other hand, metal isn\'t exactly a style of music you\'d typically associate with a comedy about a 15 year old girl. And the ending theme fits the show and stands out in that it sounds very cute and upbeat, while at the same time containing intentionally off-key vocals that sound almost frantic and hysterical at times, even throwing in the sound of the singer pretending to vomit. As for the background music for the rest of the show? It was nice and fit the scenes they were meant to fit.Character - 8/10Aside from Tomoko, not many of the characters stood out to me too much. Which I suppose is completely fine, seeing as how it is a show almost exclusively about Tomoko. Speaking of Tomoko, let\'s talk about her. She is a lonely, depressed girl who wants nothing more than to have some friends. Sure, she has Yuu-chan, her sole friend from middle school, but we don\'t get to see too much of her seeing as how she goes to a different school and isn\'t always able to find the time to hang out with Tomoko. I know a lot of people have said that Tomoko is ""the most relatable character in anime"", but I do have to agree on that. A lot of people who watch anime (myself included) have eerily similar thoughts and fantasies to Tomoko. We aren\'t always too fond of living in the real world, not all of us have very many people who we can say we love and enjoy spending time with, we judge outgoing and think of numerous reasons as to why they\'re the scum of the earth, etc. etc.. I did really like Tomoko\'s little cousin Kii-chan who comes to realize that Tomoko is just a lonely girl looking for affection (which seems almost ludicrously wise coming from a 12 year-old), and Imae-san, an older girl who attends the same school as Tomoko who takes notice to how hard she tries to find happiness and attempts to help her. All in all, I enjoyed Watamote\'s characters.Enjoyment - 7/10Aside from the cringe-fest scenes that I mentioned earlier, I found my self quite enjoying WataMote. It may not be anything mindblowing or exciting or hilarious, but you\'ll find a nice mixed bag of comical, touching, and slightly emotional and/or depressing scenes.Overall - 8/10As I sit here alone on a Saturday night typing this review in a dark room with my face lit only by my computer screen, I\'m chuckling to myself at how similar this situation seems to so many scenes in WataMote.

It was a genuinely strange series,with a nevertheless interesting concept WataMote really tried to elicit too many emotions,and as a result could not draw any of them out properly,nor could it polish all of its characters,but it manages to stay enjoyable.WataMote follows the life of a shut-in teenager who has some really queer qualities. It follows her life as a high-school student, and her quest to acquire true friendship and romance-to become an ace of life. Our character is highly socially anxious and has low-self esteem,while constantly showing her resentment for others,through her thoughts and...'subtle' actions.The cast of characters is as eccentric as the show itself. We have Tomoko Kuroki,our main character,an introvert and overall weird person,her brother Tomoki,the popular boy in his class who loves to play sports,and although younger,assumes the mature sibling role. Tomoki is the person who our main character constantly goes to for advice on how to be more social. Next we have Naruse Yuu,Tomoko's best friend from middle school,and she acts as a sort of idol,or unattainable perfection for Tomoko,resulting in an unspoken jealousy on Tomoko's behalf. Aside from these three characters,we have some recurring characters like the student council president. The characters themselves are not spectacular or overtly unique,nut they're interesting enough.I'm not  a huge fan of the art style,but I can see how it would be appealing to some. The animation is not amazing,but it's alright. Personally,I like the soundtrack and think that the opening was really nice all considered.WataMote was really strange experience. Now,it is by no means a masterpiece,or even close,but it was enjoyable,and is nice,all idiosyncrasies taken into account. It tried to bring out a multitude of emotions and in the end created a really strange mixture of them. To sum all of this up: WataMote is a strange telling of an awkward person's boringly exciting life. 'subtle' actions.The cast of characters is as eccentric as the show itself.

For me it somewhat reminded me of school days (yes I like school days), we are following a person who is falling deeper and deeper in abyss of despair, you know for every episode that it isn´t going to get better but you still have this little hope inside of you, wishing for it will go well.Even though the anime is quite dark, it has its many really lovely and...hilarious moments which are brilliant! but that entirely depends on your kind of humor :D THis is definitely not an anime for everyone´s taste.Watashi can seem quite random at first but I think that it does have a meaning and lesson that we should all learn especially animefans. Most animes we see that either the power of friendship or enough determination will resolve everything! but what about those people who got no friends? And what´about having determination? We learn in anime that if you put your mind to it then you can do it, but is that really true? What about skills? what about even luck? There is more into things success than only determination, and also you can also try too much which this anime shows perfectly!Also Watashi gives a big sucker punch for those animefans who ""romantice"" different archetypes because even though in the world of anime a tsundere is normally likeable and such, in the real world... probably not so much. :) So yeah don´t count too much on the things which we learn from anime but also those advices and such from the real life.Watashi for me tried also to point out all the many demands of society of how to be popular and yeah there are f**king many demands to live up to! and there isn´t much room for different people, being popular is somewhat a archetype itself...Only real openhearted people like the two female characters which we meet in this anime, they are the only ones who acknowledge Tomoko in her own way.the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things- This is not an average slice of life, highschool comedy (for me it is a plus besides I get bored of the normal classic high school dramas)- Its animation is simply but uses a lot of different lovely artistic effects to really make us see the world from Tomokos eyes and portray her feelings (I love the fact that most people around her has no faces, this really highlights how little she is involved in the world around her)- The voice acting of Tomoko in sub is quite perfect!- The opening and especially the fourth ending are for me very good!!- No plot you say? I really don´t understand the people who says that this has no plot, yes it does not go from A to B but it is entirely based on the concept of Tomoko trying to get popular and often with a different approach every episode, so it is not pure randomness at all.- 12 episodes without really feeling that there was missing something is a accomplishment itself! (of course it ends like a chapter because *Spoilers*, but I think that it still was a good ending, a satisfying ending without being one c**kblocking ending)- The artstyle design of Tomoko is quite great, she has a character design which would always be recognized because I haven´t seen anime character design which looks like her! :)All the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons- If you don´t like Tomoko as a character you will hate this anime because it is entirely depended on her. (so it is either a love or hate anime)- Yes it is cringe the anime and yes a few scenes I only saw it partly while I was covering my face because I couldn´t handle the cringe XD- It is a dark anime and the ending is not your average happy ending, therefore I am reminded of school days (even though it has not that schocking ending but Watashi still leaves you with this feeling of despair :) and yeah quite a handful of people would probably not be happy about that, but I loved it!)Should you watch it? Definitely, just a few episodes would be good, just like it is recommended to see the first episodes of Serial experiments lain, it is a experience which needs to be tried because really just like Serial experiments lain is quite the special snowflake among the psychological thrillers of anime then Watashi is the special snowflake among high school comedies :) So yeah watch two episode if you don´t like it stop and take it as a experience, if you liked it, welcome to the ride! hilarious moments which are brilliant! but that entirely depends on your kind of humor :D THis is definitely not an anime for everyone´s taste.Watashi can seem quite random at first but I think that it does have a meaning and lesson that we should all learn especially animefans.

Our main protagonist is a young girl named Tomoko who suffers from very severe social anxiety. The plot revolves around all of her attempts (and usually failures) to make friends in school and get people to notice her.During the first couple of episodes I laughed my head off, and yet couldn't decide whether or not I was actually supposed to be laughing. In truth, while a very comedic show with hilariously awkward moments, Watamote is so...tragic. And I guess the reason I decided it was okay to laugh was because I can relate to Tomoko on so many levels: how she struggles to talk to strangers and hold a conversation, how she overanalyzes situations and what people will think, how much more comfortable she is on her own than with other people, yet she still gets lonely... I totally get it. The only difference is, I've always had a loving support system, while Tomoko is mostly on her own to come up with crazy, messed up ideas in her head of how to get popular. But I knew where she was coming from, and therefore I could laugh while still rooting for her and hoping just maybe something good would happen to her in the next episode. Luckily, a few times the writers gave us a treat and I felt myself welling up with tears when I saw Tomoko successfully talk to someone or get treated with kindness.The ending, while fitting in my opinion, certainly wasn't what I wished it could be. Yet, I suppose that's what makes it kind of realistic. My only hope is that eventually she'll come out of her shell a little and make some new friends. Maybe I'll have to read the manga sometime :)Anyway, I thought this was an excellent anime, albeit not for everyone. To me, it was clever how the writer made the series into a comedy without toning down or truly making light of the struggles associated with social anxiety. Really a lot of fun to watch. tragic.

Really a lot of fun to watch."", 'First of all, even if the score is a 5, I don\'t wan\'t you to think that this is an ""average"" anime. This anime deserves the 5 for having really good pros to watch it, but also some awful flaws. It is funny at a time, then painful at the other. It can be really cute, then suddenly fall into creepyness. It can be hot then you\'re cold, you\'re yes then you\'re  no, you\'re in then you\'re out... (Katy Perry could certainly do a review of this). This is retard let\'s start this shit ffs.As it is supposed to be a comedy, I\'m going...to start talking about the lulz. Here it REAAALLY depends on your type of humor. The humor displayed in this show was pretty good if you are a goddamn masochist. I\'m not saying that it was painfully bad, it was painfully funny. Gags were 70% awfully pitiful situations suffered by the main character Tomoko while trying too hard to socialize. This are funny...-ish, but also so fucking awkward that if you are not really similar to the main character (hence the ""relatability"" of the show""), you will feel more sorry for Tomoko\'s bad luck than actually aroused by the gag. The other 30% were made up of the delusions created by Tomoko\'s crazy, uncivilized mind. Tomoko is introvert to such an extent that her delusions are out of this world, and honestly, I did laughed quite a lot with those.Concerning the art, it was actually quite great and unique. Shades of grey and colors resembled perfectly Tomoko\'s feelings at moments, animation was constantly aboive the average and I find particularly original the cubist-ish deformation that Tomoko suffered when she was let down. Sound was pretty mediocre, but the rest of the art was great.Now, let\'s get into the main point of the series, aside for the humor: it\'s supposed ""relatability"". I was engaged to watch the anime due to the huge worship around Tomoko\'s character on the internet. People found it very relatable, and was waifu of many. I personally found the show WAY too exaggerated to ever be relatable to ANYONE, at least that I know. And I can tell you that I\'m definitely not a popular guy, but hell, Tomoko was too much to handle.Tomoko, as a character, although it has literally zero to negative evolution throughout the series, it\'s really interesting, but just an hyperbole of social anxiety. Time has passed too fast for her, and her egotistical though introvert attitude has made her not capable of establishing any new friendship with anybody in high school. What I definitely could see as the main point of the series (hence its title) is that Tomoko is constantly blaming on society for not paying attention to her and her superiority delusions. Her limited knowledge of human socializing and her days of gaming and watching anime have made her a ""solo player"", and dehumanized her to a point that she sees becoming popular as no more than a checkpoint on a video game, instead of considering that real life is an evergrowing ""final boss"" whose effects you can\'t control. Furthermore, the fact that makes the show much more suffering is that people are actually really kind to her. In reality, she would probably get bullied, but the fact that no one is coercing or bullying her, but just pitying on her and leaving her apart, makes it nearly impossible for Tomoko to blame anyone more than herself for her situation. However, no matter what, she keeps doing. Tomoko is quite of a horrible human being, but also a hopeless, defenceless one. Everyone would be like Tomoko under those conditions of social isolation.In the end, who is to blame in this show? Tomoko? Society? Her parents or her brother? Her best elementary school friend Yuu-chan for being more popular than her? Imae-chan and Kii-chan for seeing her as a helpless stray dog? Probably everyone, or anybody at all. The fact is that this isn\'t anymore about the show. People like Tomoko exist in society nowadays, and the fact of leaving them apart is just as wrong as bullying them. Every human being deserves to be treated nicely at the least, but you know what? Let\'s get further from this point. Think about it the next time you are in school or in college when you see someone on their own for several days. Don\'t just be polite, but try befriending him or her just as you would do with any other person. Not being condescending, not being agressive, just being friendly. Maybe beneath that defensive armour of lonelyness you will find an awesome human being, forgotten by society long time ago, who may reveal it\'s own nature to its peers. Seriously, is that easy.Overall, you may love this show, you may absolutely hate it, but you should understand it\'s purpose besides comedy: to show the reality of a person with social anxiety, and to teach how NOT to deal with it. to start talking about the lulz.

In effect of being bombed by critics for being offensive (that's what I heard but there's literally no offensive part of the show), the anime couldn't continue with a second season, making the end of the show feel unfinished.

However, if you do want to watch a complete anime comedy with a well developed plot, I suggest searching else where.(P.S.- Don't let the part about being offensive turn you down, because Watamote is not anywhere near...that point.) that point.)"", 'I don\'t know why Tomoko didn\'t ask for help by telling her parents family or teachers about her problem; but instead of that she tries to comfort herself with too much unreal imaginations, and telling others how good she is in Highschool.

And by hardest doesn't mean what they could or should do, just to the extent of the best they are capable of doing..even though for most of us, we'd think its nothing much..For one, I'm really impressed at the seiyuu for Tomoko, Izumi Kitta for her excellent portrayal of Tomoko. I'd say...she did it perfectly. I feel amazed almost everytime I hear Tomoko speak to others in her small and shaky voice to the people she is not close with.I'd recommend people to watch this if you want to see a real 'slice-of-life' series.. One without harems and cliche'd happy lives and where optimism could make things better no matter what hardships happen. she did it perfectly.

I know some people don't like Watamote because of its treatment of social anxiety but, as someone who has social anxiety, I think it handles social anxiety pretty well in, some ways. I get panicky and nervous when I am around crowds, and I unable to speak to people other than family members, so I'm just like Tomoko when I was 15 years old and in high school.Let's talk about the story of this controversial anime, shall...we?Story: It is about a popular girl named Tomoko Kuroki who has a lot of boyfriends and friends in the world of otome games. In reality, Tomoko is a unsociable loner who doesn't have any friends in her first year in high school. The series follows Tomoko as she attempts to improve her social status in high school.The story is very interesting and easy to follow. I give it 10/10Art: The art isn't magnificent like the manga art cover but it's beautiful nonetheless. 8/10Sound- Whimsical,  sorrow, joyful, and pleasant to hear. I love the background music whenever Tomoko is happy. It makes me smile all the time. 10/10Character: I don't like all of the episodes in Watamote, to be honest. Yes, they are likable ones like Tomoko, Yuu-chan, Tomoko's cousins, Tomoko's parents, and Megumi, but there also mean-spirited ones like one of  Tomoki's friends who called her ugly in the first episode. 7/10Enjoyment: I enjoy it! 10/10Overall: It's a good anime with its ups and downs. we?Story: It is about a popular girl named Tomoko Kuroki who has a lot of boyfriends and friends in the world of otome games.

These types of folks hate dirtbag main characters.  I don’t really trust people like that.I think good people understand their inner dirtbag.  Watamote is a test, developed by Silver Link Studios—a test to see who can really tune in to the higher levels of reality.The kind of person who hates this program is the sort of person who cannot face their own short-comings.I am one of the realest people on the planet; so, it’s no wonder that I loved this show...and totally identified with the main character.  I empathized with her agony and frustrating anxiety. Watamote’s immersion in frustration felt like a nail file being raked again my gums and I could not get enough.  As the heroine descended further into despair I sat titillated, hoping for her to fail harder and harder.  Mind you, this was not out of hatred for the character; it was out the excitement for seeing how far Japanese television could push the limits of true humanity.Sometimes there were episodes where I fell into the trap of wanting Kuroki to make a friend before she ultimately failed. I was never disappointed though.  I knew that as long as she remained alone, the show could go on and so could my joy.  A happy episode would ruin everything. It would ruin Kuroki-chan’s beauty. That is why it cannot be.Unfortunately, nobody bought the DVD’s and we will never see a program this great ever again. There is just no room in the market for incest free motion pictures these days. To make up for that void, I’ve opted for repeat viewings.  This might be the first anime I ever watch from beginning to end twice in the same week.I did have to deduct a point for a whole episode surrounding rape/sexual assault jokes.  Where I come from, that’s just not cool no more.  A perfect 10/10 ruined by left wing fanaticism. Thanks Obama. and totally identified with the main character.

Then don't read it.Let me just say this first, if you have a girlfriend or a friend who is a girl or you are a girl and you can relate/know a lot of the girl BL kind of references (mostly the CD's she listens to in the show) you can appreciate this a lot more.Even if you don't its still a great show to watch. What I love more than anything is that they didn't make the main character this overly attractive or overly cute girl (at first) she seemed so normal in that sense and the art...the used really put emphasis on that. This is a slice of life show but compared to other slice of life anime its a hit. You'll always be laughing, you'll be in shock of how much the characters life reflects or has similarities to your own. It's an easy character to get attached too. The ending is also not that bad either. NO INCEST =DDDD yes she has a brother and no they don't start a relationship. THANK CHRIST.

(Or as the sane call it, Watamote)- and that is simply because it is the most hard to watch anime out there. I have seen brutal horror animes and read Punpun just to name a few close comparisons in hard to finish, but in the end I honestly can say that Watamote is an anime that I can just not complete under any sane circumstance and I congratulate people who have gotten through the whole thing. But this is not because of what is put...into the show is bad, but rather.... Well, It\'s better to leave it to it\'s own section at the end.I\'m going to get the criteria I usually save until the end out of the way so I can talk about what makes this show so unbearable to watch in the ""Enjoyment"" section:STORY: 6Watamote has some sort of progression, a slow introduction of a gradual cast of characters, plot points in each episode that are coherent- but it doesn\'t seem to ever want to go anywhere. I suppose this is normal for ""Slice of Life"" animes, but Watamote seems stubborn in keeping you in one place. Each episode seems to drag on for eternity, to the point where it almost feels real time from day to night- and not in the show\'s favour.ART: 7The first I was introduced to this anime besides from a basic outline of the plot was the opening- and wow, it caught my eye. It\'s art style is stylized enough to stand way out from the crowd, yet firm enough to remain easy to look at and not a strain on the eyes. However, once the actual anime starts, it begins to show it\'s seams and laziness once in a while. But overall, the artstyle is very pleasant to look at- and while the opening is definitely the best animation you\'ll be seeing on the show, the rest isn\'t exactly a tax on the overall quality of the show.SOUND: 9Probably the best part of the anime. Watamote isn\'t afraid of going all over the place with it\'s soundtrack- from the extremely unfitting metal/hard rock roots that are still absolutely amazing to listen to, to probably the only Hatsune Miku song I really like, to upbeat pop and sometimes jazz. Some music and ambience even seems like it\'s fitting in a more horror based anime- I just love the way Watamote isn\'t afraid to just experiment with it\'s soundtrack and not have one distinct style. (Almost) every track is a pleasure to listen to, and the ones that aren\'t are either joke tracks or play for a brief duration in the show. I\'d highly recommend a skimming through the OST.The voice acting is also good too, and fitting to the characters they play. They express a lot of emotion and feeling just through voice sometimes. (English Subtitles/Japanese Voiceover)CHARACTER: 4Every character is a stereotype. In short, this is fitting based on the fact that this anime is sort of a ""lens"" into how the main character views the world, but it really just ends up feeling lazy and generic as each character shows up and you see the extent of their one dimension within 5 minutes. A small girl is cute but observant, Tomoko\'s friend is hot and popular but used to be nerdy, etc etc. It feels like it was done in a total of 5 minutes.The one exception is Tomoko. While I do not like her character that much personally, I appreciate the depth and thoroughness they put into the character. She is expressive, and a lot of her feelings are relatable to some points in our lives.ENJOYMENT: 2And here we go. If you don\'t already know based on the plot of this show (and my apologies for not briefly explaining it earlier, I wanted to keep you in some sort of suspense!), Watamote is about a socially awkward teenager and her escapades of never getting a lucky break. It\'s the equivalent of going on youtube and searching up cringeworthy videos- however it\'s even harder and less enjoyable to watch than that because it\'s an anime that was made specifically to pander to an audience who wants to watch this, and because of that, is constantly trying to push your buttons and force second hand embarrassment. Tomoko cheats at a card tournament for elementary school kids despite being in highschool, gets caught unknowingly by her parents listening to audioporn with a ""back massager"", and frequently ignores personal hygiene and all effort to keep herself together- all while asking the world why she isn\'t popular. And while it is true that we sometimes miss the obvious and look past basic things that cast us in a negative light, Watamote will purposefully amp it up to 10 and make you bite your nails down to the core while watching it.But there is some truth to a few of the things Tomoko does. While a lot of the experiences she goes through panders only to a small group of extremely socially awkward people, there was a few relatable moments where her introversion caused more harm than good (My favourite is when she mentally maps a floor plan and potential actions of people around her just so she can avoid bumping into people she knows at mcdonalds).But overall, I have to say that Watamote is probably the least enjoyable anime I\'ve watched. It makes my whole body tingle unpleasantly and curl up as Tomoko spends a large amount of an episode arguing uselessly with people on the anime\'s equivalent of 2chan, looking through binoculars to spy on undressing women with middle schoolers, and jokingly hitting on her (comparatively) normal brother to the point of implying incest as the joke flies way over his head.OVERALL: 6A few of my friends who have also watched the show all have different interpretations of it- Some say it is a in depth study of social awkwardness, some say it\'s just a comedy, and some say it shouldn\'t even be viewed as funny. But I say no matter what it is, it\'s a pain to watch. It\'s not the art that makes it bad, it\'s not the sound that makes it bad, sometimes it\'s not even the characters that make it bad. It\'s the pure essence of cringe and second hand embarrassment that makes me not recommend this show to anyone who wants something that isn\'t spine tingling and hard to swallow.I know some people probably do, but I don\'t watch anime because I want to be forced to look away from the screen because my body is tensing up so hard from watching a socially awkward character fail miserably at something.

A hook.', ""Story: 9/10This story is a unique one, to say the least. It's realistic, and while it's almost too painfully relatable to the common unpopular girl, it's funny and fastpaced and is hardly ever boring.Art: 7/10The character designs are somewhat simplistic, but the animation flows well and has a clear style to it - one that goes well with the story. I liked Tomoko's design a lot - it was cute, but not in a typical way. The backgrounds didn't stand out all that much, but they weren't bad.Sound: 5/10I hated the theme song - I skipped it every time. It's loud, screamo stuff reminiscent of...the second Death Note OP. I don't know if it's meant to be ironic or not, but it's horrible either way. I didn't mind the regular background music, but it didn't stand out as incredible or anything. The ending OP is cute, though.Character: 9/10Koroki Tomoko is one of my favourite characters in existence - she's awkward, she's weirdly cute, she's shy, she's nervous, she's real. Since I'm autistic, she's relatable to me in that aspect (even though she isn't stated to have autism, more like severe social anxiety). She gives off a lot of secondhand embarrassment, but she's someone that you root for throughout the series nevertheless.The other characters besides Tomoko are more regular, but they're not bad. Yuu-chan, her friend, is fairly cute, and Tomoko's brother is likeable.Enjoyment: 7/10If you like stories in which the underdog rises to the top, this one is unfortunately not for you. It's enjoyable to watch in that it has a good plot and interesting scenarios, but it's horribly uncomfortable and at times a little disheartening. I would've liked to see Tomoko achieve some level of happiness, but she really doesn't go through much change throughout the series, which is disappointing to the viewer.Overall: 8/10While Watamote has a lot of flaws, it is overall a good, relatable show. It's short and sweet and unique. I would recommend watching it. the second Death Note OP. I don't know if it's meant to be ironic or not, but it's horrible either way.

Welcome to the same scenario as Watamote.~PLOT~Being that this is a slice of life show there is no real plot. Girl is unpopular, trys to do something to stand out, fails, repeat. I personally have no issues with this, It\'s just that you can see the problem or the fail before it even starts. I also like how the show makes parody scenes from diffrent anime such as death note, evalengelion, and others that I haven\'t seen yet because I\'m lazy.~Characters~Theres actually only 3 characters that...even play a part in this showTomoko - A very shy 1st year high school girl that is trying to make friends and be popular.Tomoki - Her younger brother and the complete opposite of tomoko.

This is both the best animation and the best track in the whole show. The animation only shines in the times they make parody refrences to diffrent shows, but thats it. The sound and animation any other time are basic. The dub isn\'t bad either but I have not watched the sub. The dub is satisfying enough to watch and leave it as is, but it\'s odd and Has it\'s moments.~FINAL~Watamote defiantly had potential in the first few episodes but slowly died down and got old later in the show.

I enjoyed that I could empathize with the main character a lot, even though we are of two different sexes. It has a really sad plot, and it will make you want to cry watching her fail at everything every episode. (It made me want to cry for her at least.) But it's not all bad. I really enjoyed the music throughout the anime, even the OP+ED songs. Not to mention it's really lewd and it has a lot of good humorous moments to give you a break from the sadness. The art's really good in my opinion, and...the sound was fantastic. I also love the voice actor, (she also sings the ending song, which is AWESOME.) and overall it's just a well made relateable-albeit a trivial one- story of a girls high school life. If you have some troubling social issues I wouldn't recommend watching it, because it might hurt a little bit, but if you can handle it then go for it. the sound was fantastic.

I found this anime an amazing piece of work due to how the feelings of the main protagonist backfires onto the viewer, leaving them embarrassed and pity not themselves, but about the protagonist. It's done a good job at doing that. Besides that, Watamote is extremely hilarious, being a comedy anime. I feel kind of rude since I don't laugh exactly with the main protagonist but 'at' her. I thought the art could have been better...since in my own opinion, the main protagonist should have been a tad more uglier. Though I found the appearance of her uniform worn really suits her character. Speaking of character, I believe each person especially the main protagonist played their character or personality very nicely. I love how the main protagonist is extremely serious on trying to become more attractive and popular but never succeeded. The way she tries to socialize with others besides her family makes me want fall off my chair and earn a 6 pack from laughing too hard.

Tomoko Kuroki is the protagonist of this series. Though she wants to make friends, and to even have a boyfriend, she is extremely bad at talking to people. She usually finds herself in very awkward situations. Her appearance and shyness gets her nowhere in developing good social skills, and also the fact that she usually ends up procrastinating. The only world world where Tomoko is successful is the Otome game world, where she can have as many ""boyfriends"" as she wants. Her only friend is Yuu Naruse, a preppy girl from her middle school, and she also has a younger brother named Tomoki Kuroki.I loved the opening theme to this anime, as well as the background music. Although the opening title sounds very misleading, the lyrics completely relate to the anime. I can\'t really say much about the voice acting, because to me the voice acting in anime all sounds the same, no matter if its Japanese dubbed or English dubbed.In the end, Watamote is, in my opinion, simply amazing because of how relatable I am to it.

The reason for this, is because this anime was so obnoxious and boring all together that I couldn't even finish it... I normally finish even the most appalling of anime, but this was just too much.The pathetic story of this sounds interesting, but it's played out so horribly bad that I found myself just falling asleep in the middle of each episode. 24 minutes per episode was just way too long to bare.The voice acting of the main character annoyed the crap out of me. Especially when...she was talking to herself in her head. If I were her brother, I don't think I would have lived through more than a week dealing with her.

Unfortunately, I was really disappointed by this show.Story: 3/10The premise of the show is one that I think actually had an insane amount of potential. Writing from the perspective of the main character Tomoko, who happens to be your stereotypical weeb, dealing with mental health issues and the growing emotional...pains of being an awkward teenager, is a refreshing change of pace from your usual anime series. Whereas most anime is, to varying degrees, escapism, WataMote is the exact opposite of that, and I think there is some merit to try and challenge that status quo by creating a story based around concepts that aren't explored too often, but are still greatly familiar to most viewers, as to not alienate them. In fact, there were moments in the show that I was able to relate to on an almost visceral level, things that I've experienced almost exactly like how they play out here, and that's coming from someone who's not particularly socially awkward, so I can imagine how uncomfortably close to home this show could hit for some people.And that's the key word. Uncomfortable. WataMote is hard to watch. Watching Tomoko get into some really awkward situations. and then making them 10 times worse by being completely socially inept is played out for laughs like 95% of the time. However, if you're anything like me, you'll exclusively be anxiously laughing from the unbearable secondhand embarrassment rather than be genuinely amused by Tomoko's shortcomings. I can't properly enjoy a story when it's such a painfully real one that's constantly being painted into a lighthearted, comedic tone, when, in reality, someone who actually goes through these types of situations, and handles them the way Tomoko does, would be devastated to know that they've fucked up another social interaction by just being incredibly bad at them, and they'd feel like shit about it for weeks, kinda like Tomoko, but again, the show plays these situations and her reactions to them as a comedy. Personally, laughing at someone's expense just really isn't my thing, though I guess there is a crowd for that, so if that's you, then maybe give WataMote a shot.Art: 6/10The art style's not a whole lot to write home about, though I do have to mention that I really love the fact that Tomoko is made to look like an absolute mess, all the time. Her eyebags are dark and massive, her posture's terrible, she's quite skinny and pale, her head looks gigantic and disproportionate, and she's significantly shorter than damn near everyone around her, especially her classmates. The fact that they didn't draw Tomoko as a well put-together, attractive girl with giant tits, and instead went out of their way to make her look like she hasn't willingly touched grass or let sunlight hit her skin in years, is an aspect that I think grounds this series even deeper into reality. She's also drawn in a slightly chibi art style, which thankfully doesn't clash with the rest of the characters, who are all drawn in a pretty typical style. I also like the little art style change that happens occasionally near the end of episodes, when Tomoko's talking with her brother, it's pretty cute. The sudden still shots of Tomoko drawn in a cubist or surrealist art style that occur throughout the show are also fun, though they're quite out of place and the first couple times it happened, it was really jarring. The visuals on the OP and ED are decent, if a bit excessively edgy on the former's part. The animation itself is also fairly standard, though there's a few clunky moments, most notably in one episode where Tomoko is walking away from the camera's perspective, but instead just dawdles in place for like 10 seconds during what's supposed to be an emotional moment in the show.Sound: 5/10I honestly can't remember any music or sound effects that played during the episodes, other than the edgily iconic OP, which I somewhat enjoy even if I skipped it after the first three episodes, and the ED, which is cute and kinda funny, but the shouty, childish vocals got annoying very quickly. I ended up skipping it on all but two episodes. There's also a beautiful song that makes for a great emotional moment during the only episode of the show I truly enjoyed, but I'll get to that in a bit.Character: 3/10Since there's not a lot of important recurring characters, I'll mostly focus on Tomoko herself. Like I mentioned previously, she's your stereotypical weeb: a total shut-in, has no friends, is in desperate need for a normal social interaction that she cannot for the life of her insert herself into because of how socially inept she is, spends all her time watching anime, porn or playing videogames, and is absolutely terrified at the thought of having to do anything else other than those things, occasionally even lashing out when being forced to do them. She spends her every waking moment imagining situations in which she's not a social reject, she imagines herself as the main character of a shoujo/shounen series, whether it's her being a quiet, mysterious girl all the students in her class are desperate to know more about, or a bubbly and voluptuous girl, it seems like she wants to be everyone but herself. Tomoko's self hatred runs so deep that she's constantly insulting and putting down (obviously not out loud since she can't even look at people in the eye without losing her mind) the very girls she wants to imitate, calling them whores and sluts, wishing for them to die violent deaths. She even refers to her only friend in the world, Yuu, as a slut and gets irrationally angry and envious when she notices Yuu's breasts had grown quite a bit since the last time they had seen each other. Tomoko's lonely as fuck, she's got a lot of internalized misogyny, an insane amount of insecurities, an absurd understanding of how the world works (since her only sources of entretainment, friendship and news is the internet and anime) and clearly a lot of serious mental health issues including depression (which, again, are almost always played out for laughs).Throughout the show, Tomoko tries various things to try and get out of her comfort zone, always with a goal in mind, whether it's getting the attention of or seducing some guy, being integrated into a friend group, joining a club, participating in class activities, being noticed by her classmates, etc. She always has a plan, though none of them make a whole lot of sense, they're not very well thought out and they never succeed, but hey, at least she's trying, right? Unfortunately, since none of her schemes work out nor does she learn anything from them, her character development is practically nonexistent. She never grows out of her horrible behaviors, she never learns to be true to herself, she doesn't think she's doing anything wrong and keeps blaming everybody but herself for her own problems (for reference, read the show's translated name), and she never gets better. In fact, I think by the final episode, she's even worse than she was initially, as she accidentally sees an upperclassmate's panties when a gust of wind lifts up her skirt, and Tomoko reacts by running away from the school all the way to her house without stopping, crying and screaming the whole way, even ignoring Yuu, who runs after her, calling out her name. Yeah. Sometimes, Tomoko makes the kids in school who'd Naruto run through the hallways and energy charge when they were mad seem well-adjusted.I mentioned earlier that Tomoko's depression and loneliness are ALMOST always played out for laughs. There is one exception to that constant array of comedy at our protagonist's expense. Episode 10 is the only time we get a good look at Tomoko's mental state, how she copes with her issues, her usual daydreaming from a more realistic point of view, how desperately she just needs someone she can rely on, how she grasps at whatever gives her a slight serotonin boost and hangs on to it for dear life, how quickly she gets discouraged by small things, and her genuine reaction when something that makes her happy is taken away. It's a beautiful and emotional episode with very few, but tasteful and well-timed comedic moments. It all climaxes into a gorgeous ending song. It almost made me cry from how genuine her feelings seemed and how good of a representation of depression this episode is. I thought that this would be the turning point for Tomoko, where she finally realizes that she needs to change and that there's no way she can do it unless she gets real help and accepts it, I thought the show was about to get serious near the end, but nah, the next episode begins with Tomoko aggressively wishing that her classmates, who are literally just standing there, are reincarnated as poop in their next life.Tomoko is a really interesting and unique character that, under serious writing, could become a very compelling protagonist with some fantastic character development, but unfortunately, WataMote treats her more like a laughingstock than anything else.As for other characters, her brother Tomoki, is one that gets no character development at all, but his relationship with Tomoko and their interactions are pretty realistic, and there's even some heartwarming moments that come from it. I wish we had seen more of the brother, as well as a better exploration of Tomoko's relationship with all her family, since it seems that both her dad and her mom are used to seeing her be an absolute freak.Enjoyment: 3/10I just couldn't get much enjoyment out of something that's constantly making me feel uncomfortable. And I don't mean uncomfortable in a challenging, question-everything-you-know type of way, but more in like a throwing-garbage-at-a-stray-puppy-that's-missing-a-leg-and-laughing-and-pointing-at-it type of way. It's not particularly fun for me. Though there were some elements I enjoyed and there's even some comedic moments I thought were funny, but most of them are interactions that Tomoko has with her family (like the vibrator scene or the voice acting scene), so again, I just wish her home life was explored more deeply, though I guess there's no need for that when all you want to do is make your main character suffer constantly by trying to interact with strangers in the outside world. I tried to sometimes imagine Tomoko through a neurodivergent perspective to try and understand her a bit more, but the constant bombarding of trying to make the audience laugh just completely ruined that for me, also I just know that that's not what the creators were going for at all, either, so whatever. I really only enjoyed two episodes, episode 10 and episode 13, the latter of which is a 27-minute monster, and it tells a cringy and childish situation from the perspective of Tomoko, as well as this other pretentious kid who probably watched Death Note once and then based his whole personality off Light Yagami. It's the only episode where I enjoy the comedic take on Tomoko's klutziness and inability to have a normal human interaction.Overall, WataMote is a show that I struggled to get through and only finished it because I hate dropping series. It had one good moment near the end, but it picked me up only to put me down almost inmediately after. The show just can't stand to take itself seriously, even though the topic that it chose to base its main character off of is quite serious. The comedy is only halfway decent at best, the show itself throws in a lot of moments that stick out like a sore thumb (episodes 10 and 13, multiple sexual assault scenarios, etc etc etc) for god knows what reason, considering that a majority of those don't serve much of a purpose or aren't particularly comedic, most of the aspects of the show that still resound in my head after finishing it are all pretty negative, it honestly just pissed me off and made me want to stop watching most of the times. I guess if you're fine with this type of comedy at the expense of someone else, you might find WataMote really entretaining, but for me, this was just torturous and I don't plan on watching it ever again.3/10 pains of being an awkward teenager, is a refreshing change of pace from your usual anime series. Whereas most anime is, to varying degrees, escapism, WataMote is the exact opposite of that, and I think there is some merit to try and challenge that status quo by creating a story based around concepts that aren't explored too often, but are still greatly familiar to most viewers, as to not alienate them.

She never grows out of her horrible behaviors, she never learns to be true to herself, she doesn't think she's doing anything wrong and keeps blaming everybody but herself for her own problems (for reference, read the show's translated name), and she never gets better. In fact, I think by the final episode, she's even worse than she was initially, as she accidentally sees an upperclassmate's panties when a gust of wind lifts up her skirt, and Tomoko reacts by running away from the school all the way to her house without stopping, crying and screaming the whole way, even ignoring Yuu, who runs after her, calling out her name. Yeah. Sometimes, Tomoko makes the kids in school who'd Naruto run through the hallways and energy charge when they were mad seem well-adjusted.I mentioned earlier that Tomoko's depression and loneliness are ALMOST always played out for laughs. There is one exception to that constant array of comedy at our protagonist's expense. Episode 10 is the only time we get a good look at Tomoko's mental state, how she copes with her issues, her usual daydreaming from a more realistic point of view, how desperately she just needs someone she can rely on, how she grasps at whatever gives her a slight serotonin boost and hangs on to it for dear life, how quickly she gets discouraged by small things, and her genuine reaction when something that makes her happy is taken away. It's a beautiful and emotional episode with very few, but tasteful and well-timed comedic moments. It all climaxes into a gorgeous ending song. It almost made me cry from how genuine her feelings seemed and how good of a representation of depression this episode is. I thought that this would be the turning point for Tomoko, where she finally realizes that she needs to change and that there's no way she can do it unless she gets real help and accepts it, I thought the show was about to get serious near the end, but nah, the next episode begins with Tomoko aggressively wishing that her classmates, who are literally just standing there, are reincarnated as poop in their next life.Tomoko is a really interesting and unique character that, under serious writing, could become a very compelling protagonist with some fantastic character development, but unfortunately, WataMote treats her more like a laughingstock than anything else.As for other characters, her brother Tomoki, is one that gets no character development at all, but his relationship with Tomoko and their interactions are pretty realistic, and there's even some heartwarming moments that come from it. I wish we had seen more of the brother, as well as a better exploration of Tomoko's relationship with all her family, since it seems that both her dad and her mom are used to seeing her be an absolute freak.Enjoyment: 3/10I just couldn't get much enjoyment out of something that's constantly making me feel uncomfortable. And I don't mean uncomfortable in a challenging, question-everything-you-know type of way, but more in like a throwing-garbage-at-a-stray-puppy-that's-missing-a-leg-and-laughing-and-pointing-at-it type of way. It's not particularly fun for me. Though there were some elements I enjoyed and there's even some comedic moments I thought were funny, but most of them are interactions that Tomoko has with her family (like the vibrator scene or the voice acting scene), so again, I just wish her home life was explored more deeply, though I guess there's no need for that when all you want to do is make your main character suffer constantly by trying to interact with strangers in the outside world. I tried to sometimes imagine Tomoko through a neurodivergent perspective to try and understand her a bit more, but the constant bombarding of trying to make the audience laugh just completely ruined that for me, also I just know that that's not what the creators were going for at all, either, so whatever. I really only enjoyed two episodes, episode 10 and episode 13, the latter of which is a 27-minute monster, and it tells a cringy and childish situation from the perspective of Tomoko, as well as this other pretentious kid who probably watched Death Note once and then based his whole personality off Light Yagami. It's the only episode where I enjoy the comedic take on Tomoko's klutziness and inability to have a normal human interaction.Overall, WataMote is a show that I struggled to get through and only finished it because I hate dropping series. It had one good moment near the end, but it picked me up only to put me down almost inmediately after. The show just can't stand to take itself seriously, even though the topic that it chose to base its main character off of is quite serious. The comedy is only halfway decent at best, the show itself throws in a lot of moments that stick out like a sore thumb (episodes 10 and 13, multiple sexual assault scenarios, etc etc etc) for god knows what reason, considering that a majority of those don't serve much of a purpose or aren't particularly comedic, most of the aspects of the show that still resound in my head after finishing it are all pretty negative, it honestly just pissed me off and made me want to stop watching most of the times. I guess if you're fine with this type of comedy at the expense of someone else, you might find WataMote really entretaining, but for me, this was just torturous and I don't plan on watching it ever again.3/10"", ""This review contains spoilers.Watamote could have been great but ultimately ended up being more of a miss than a hit. It's a comedy that's not funny enough and a drama that doesn't take itself seriously enough. It suffers from uncreative storytelling and a painfully slow pace that leads to little progression being made even for twelve episodes. I get why this has such a dedicated following but the execution was really off, especially when it came to the comedy.The comedy that does work and manages to be funny is generally situational. Tomoko trying (and failing) to seduce her brother, accidentally broadcasting porn to her mom,...and wanting to be an arms dealer are all quite funny and while a few of those bits last a tad too long, they all manage to work as humor. Most of the comedy here is cringe comedy, which only works when the subject deserves to be laughed at. Tomoko does a lot of dickish things, but I'm still rooting for her to get friends because the main reason why she acts this way is because her crippling anxiety prevents her from having meaningful relationships. This puts her in a position where she is extremely cynical about the people around her and ends up being really dismissive and toxic towards them internally. Her anxiety does not excuse that, but it does explain it. I want her to succeed. What is not explained by her anxiety is the fact that she cheats in a card game against young children.The biggest flaw this show has is its lack of progression. With the exception of having hindsight, she's very similar as a person at the end of the show as she is in the beginning. That's not to say that the show couldn't have pulled it off. If it was consistently funny or showed Tomoko's inner psyche beyond just explaining what she's thinking it could still work. Watamote doesn't and ends up being in an awkward place halfway between a dark comedy and a tragedy. Most episodes can be summed up as Tomoko trying something new, failing at said new thing, then repeating the same thing next episode like nothing happened. It's not that she needs to progress in a good way. This show is fairly realistic in terms of her experiences from what I've heard and it could have easily been about her spiraling downwards.This lack of a direction makes Watamote an unfulfilling watch, and while the show kind of needs to be an awkward watch in order to achieve what it sets out to do, that doesn't excuse the lack of an ending and the lack of progression. This is a shame because the ideas here are pretty inspired and could have been great if the writing was better. It's a deeply flawed show but there were some good points.While I'm giving this a 4/10, I respect it a lot more than most other shows I'd give a 4. Watamote has more than its fair share of good qualities. Tomoko's character design is actually pretty well thought out, she's designed to look like the way she views herself, complete with a flat chest, bony figure, and large bags under her eyes. There were more than a few good scenes as well, the scene in episode 11 where Tomoko loses her lunch spot is directed really well and shows what Watamote could have been if it had better writing. When the jokes actually manage to land they're also some of the better ones in comedy anime as well. This isn't enough to make Watamote good, and the majority of the show is just not well done. and wanting to be an arms dealer are all quite funny and while a few of those bits last a tad too long, they all manage to work as humor.

Not your typical slice-of-life anime. It\'s like taking those embarrassing teen moments, cranking the dial up to 11, and serving it with a side of dark humor. The show is basically a masterclass in second-hand embarrassment.Now, if you\'re hunting for rosy high school romances or fairy-tale endings, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you want a painfully honest (and hilarious) portrayal of teenage social anxiety, Tomoko\'s your girl. You\'ll laugh, you\'ll cringe, and sometimes, you\'ll want to give her a big ol\' hug.The animation style fits the mood...perfectly, with exaggerated expressions that capture Tomoko\'s wild imagination.

It is so not for everybody. There are moments in this anime that made me cringe out of my skin, and it's sometimes straight up uncomfortable to watch. But so much of the time in anime, obvious mental illness in a character is played up to be trope-ish or cute, and therefore, isn't seen as a real barrier the way it actually would be in real life.

Kuroki is real, and when you spend so much time completely isolated from people because of anxiety to that degree, you're GOING to be weird and say awkward things.

That of the treatment of the protagonist Tomoko.Tomoko Kuroki strikes me as a very excellent character in the hands of a poor author.She's a hopeless NEET and if you don't know what that term means then you wont be the kind of person who relates to Tomoko.But she's not really hopeless, a lot of the manga starts with Tomoko declaring her intent to achieve some small often meaningless goal to try and improve her social life. Then the author shoves...her back into her NEET box and punishes her for wanting to improve herself.Tomoko is a character cursed with self awareness, she knows everything she's doing is wrong and how its effecting her and strives to change. A change that is denied her by essentially God.About the only good thing in Watamote the anime is the animation which does the Hot Fuzz thing of styling every day interactions with lots of flashy edits and quick cuts to keep the pace up. And the intro theme is nice too.But just like the manga Watamote is a Sisyphean watch. her back into her NEET box and punishes her for wanting to improve herself.Tomoko is a character cursed with self awareness, she knows everything she's doing is wrong and how its effecting her and strives to change.

Assuming you read the synopsis. Let me conform:-The story has no ups. It is 12 episodes about the gloomy life of a gloomy person.-Every episode is about how she plans to become popular and the plans never work out.-The plans are stupid. And she...has no guts to start a conversation.-It is understandable to hesitate a few times but every episode is about her failing at conversing. The anime ends without her ever succeeding.-In the end the MC is a sad character who can only think of becoming popular (esp. with guys). But she can not go and talk to people upfront.-The only way you can like the anime is if you somehow find it funny instead of irritating.-The best thing about the anime is the OP song (not that it is great. more like it is interesting).-This anime does not come close to Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru or Welcome to the NHK. Don't watch this just because you liked any of these anime. And if you din't like them then definitely do not watch this.-This is also nothing like Kami Nomi. The gaming part is not an essential part of her character. And the MC's are very different.-Still, if you want to watch this anime you can. At least it will be a new experience. i.e. a new experience of pain. has no guts to start a conversation.-It is understandable to hesitate a few times but every episode is about her failing at conversing. The anime ends without her ever succeeding.-In the end the MC is a sad character who can only think of becoming popular (esp. with guys).

The show is filled with laughs, cringes, and sympathy towards the main character Tomoko Kuroki(Read Main Character Mindset if you want to know in more detail about her chracter).Quick Review: WataMote is a show that I believe shouldn't go unwatched. You're given a socially awkward girl just trying to become popular in her high school, y'know like in anime and her romantic video games, but as we all know, real life is completely different. You don't always get to retry and make that boy or girl fall for you,...you can't just sit next to a window in class and expect to become a protagonist of the world with a harem swarming around you.That type of stuff takes work but Tomoko doesn't know this. She's a quiet, awkward girl who shows a severe case of social anxiety, and you want to be with her every step of the way hoping she becomes a popular girl. With the laughs, cringes, and sympathy throughout this anime, you want to make sure this show gets those 12/12 episodes on your watchlist.Full Review (Maybe Spoilers)9/10 Main Character MindsetTomoko is a brand new character who I haven't really seen before in any cartoon really. To put it lightly she's a freak. But, I support this freak! Tomoko is a shy, quiet girl, dreaming of popularity and the harassment of a male harem. She's dark, scary, and oh-so-ever weird. I think everyone has a bit of Tomoko inside of them though. Tomoko, basically just doesn't want to be absolutely alone. Throughout the series she is only shown to have one friend, who goes to a different school, looks gorgeous, and has friends, leaving Tomoko to be by herself. She also works hard to reach her far away goals. She tries to talk to more people throughout the show, tries to get over her social anxiety,  buy the clothes that are in style during the time, and even go out to buy sexy underwear. So, when her hope is lost, she's failed miserably, or when she's crying (One scene specifically on episode 9), you have to feel for the girl who works so hard to reach her dreams and make them come true. She's an awesome character with the support of side characters making this show a blast to watch just to see Tomoko do what she does.8/10 HumorThis show is hilarious. Awkward moments run amok during the 12 episode run of the show, including Tomoko's dad walking in with Tomoko asleep holding a vibrator, Tomoko's mother walking in on her while playing an edited audio clip of some very...suggestive quotes, and of course the scene in the rain between her and two boys. You'll cringe, you'll OMG, above all you will laugh. Although there are moments where you will get caught in your feelings, some moments are just too much. Oh, and there are plenty of references to other shows, Kuroko no Basuke and Another(That's the title of the show) off the top of my head. I got super hype when they referenced Another though.7/10 PlotThe show is pretty straightforward. Unpopular, weird girl wants to be popular. You'll usually get two stories within an episode. The stories are good it's just that there's not much to do with the show except to put her in quirky scenarios.Memorable AnimeI think this show is gonna stick with me for awhile. There's a character who thinks like me in a lot of certain scenarios, something that I don't get in a lot of my anime. Tomoko is a great mc to have, with a good supportive cast, and cooky situations to put her in.

Go watch WataMote. 8/10"", 'Watamote’s main aim was producing a show that otakus like you and me could relate to and when watching it you’d be like""Holy Shit, that’s me! That is totally me, I swear this exact awkward thing happens to me. I never get the girl or boy- I never get invited to parties and no one likes talking to me. TOMOKO IS MEEEEEEEE!""*Nervously coughs*Watamote truly succeeds in making you feel of all of those things and also makes you feel as if you are watching a show based on your life. Well, that’s what I felt because I am in a sense a...lot like Kuroki. Just not as sexually frustrated or hungry for popularity that is.I mean, when you watch a anime you usually feel like projecting yourself onto the main character- especially when it’s a harem. However, in this show you don’t want to project yourself onto Tomoki- but you still can’t help but admit that you are just like her. Unless, you are popular and pretty then get the fuck out of here! *no not really though!*That is the thing about Watamote I personally liked the most- but sadly that just was not enough to make the show stand out. But, I will get to the major issues of this show later.The show hardly has any characters worth talking about except for our main female protagonist Tomoko Kuroki. Now, there are some things I loved about her and somethings I didn’t. But, don’t worry the positives outweigh the negatives. Tomoko is a very interesting character and the problems she faces are something that many people, especially girls go through in high school. She has trouble expressing herself to others- not to mention you feel bad for how lonely she is. That’s why you want to root for her to the end. But, the main thing that made me care for her was of course her personality and that she is painfully shy like muah over here. This girl is hilarious and basically every otaku’s spirit animal. She is a weird and crazy chick that is hands down epic. Reason why you don’t care that the show hardly has any memorable supporting characters.Now, the things I disliked about her character is her strong belief that she needs to be popular and also her lame attempts in becoming so. I know she is lonely and she does deserve close friends- but in the show’s twelve episode run she never realized that life in high school isn’t the end of the world. Not to mention, the actions she takes to get friends or become popular make me just nod my head left to right in disappointment. Cause, not even I was this desperate despite the fact I spent almost of my high school life in the corner of the class alone.  Heck, I still do in college!One thing that bugged me, is that no one came to Kuroki’s aid. Her parents nor her brother ever helped her come out of her shell and neither did her middle school friend. It isn’t hard to realize how shy this girl is and no one supported her at all. I swear, this show would have been a whole lot better if they introduced a character who helps out Kuroki. They were actually hinting at something like later on- however the show ended before it could happen.Watamote is a show that will disappoint many people- because it goes nowhere. Every episode is in the same pattern where you see Tomoko struggle and epically fail. That’s the show in a nutshell and it doesn’t try anything new than that. After a few episodes, it’s get repetitive and you really wish there was more to it than just that. One thing Watamote does well is executing its comedic moments and cause they knock those parts right out of the park. I remember, that there were certain moments where I just freaking lost itThe show tries so hard not to be like those clichéd shoujo and or school anime- and heck even pokes fun at them –not to mention they throw in a  shit tonne of anime references which is enjoyable. But, in the process of doing so- Watamote forgets to actually present a show in which the audience will find satisfying. Our main character hardly changes despite all that happens to her and hence the story suffers a lot from it. Not to mention, the lack of impactful characters is a huge flaw of its own.As for the animation it is pretty standard fair and something that suits this type of show very well. The main issue I have with it would the disappearing faces on the characters- not to mention all the silhouettes. But, some times they played a role at showing how lonely Tomoko really is. The character designs are nothing that original either- well except for Kuroki and her brother. I swear, they look like Moe anime characters after having a bad hangover. I loved their designs as from just looking at these two you are like ""Yep these are geeks who stay up late at night playing hentai games!""The soundtrack for Watamote was very average and it’s basically ‘Moe’ meets metal.  And to be honest I am not a big fan of the opening. The animation is cool- but the lyrics and beat really do not scream greatness for me. One track I really did love from Watamote was called ‘ Tear Breaker’ and that was honestly the only thing that stood out. That song however sounds like it belongs on Fate/Zero’s album though!Lastly, other than its realistic portrayal of a shy and introverted otaku- Watamote also has a good dub. Monica Rial gives an excellent performance as Tomoko Kuroki- and I must admit it’s probably one of my favorite performance of hers. Yes, sometimes I get annoyed how she uses the same voice for most of her characters- but that wasn’t the case Watamote. Yes, you still could tell it’s her- but you can also tell Monica was having fun voicing Tomoki and also did a great job of emoting the character perfectly. The supporting cast members did a great job too and so Emily Neves who was the ADR director did a brilliant job with this dub. The dialogue was entertaining as hell and the cast members really gave it their all.In a nutshell, Watamote is not the worst anime I have seen but it is really disappointing. It could have been something great- but it wasted all of its potential. Instead of developing Tomoko and making her story more interesting- they kept recycling the same gag in hopes that it would stand out and be better than any  other typical school anime. Not to mention- the ending of the show didn’t even feel like it helped conclude the story in any way possible.The show is by no means is boring- and it has some great moments. However, overall the show will make you feel as if you have gained nothing from watching it. And so, I am going to award Watamote with a 6 and that it was ‘Meh!’ If Watamote, does ever get another season I will definitely watch it- with hopes it will fix all the issues I recently addressed. But, I doubt it ever will ! lot like Kuroki. Just not as sexually frustrated or hungry for popularity that is.I mean, when you watch a anime you usually feel like projecting yourself onto the main character- especially when it’s a harem. However, in this show you don’t want to project yourself onto Tomoki- but you still can’t help but admit that you are just like her. Unless, you are popular and pretty then get the fuck out of here! *no not really though!*That is the thing about Watamote I personally liked the most- but sadly that just was not enough to make the show stand out. But, I will get to the major issues of this show later.The show hardly has any characters worth talking about except for our main female protagonist Tomoko Kuroki. Now, there are some things I loved about her and somethings I didn’t. But, don’t worry the positives outweigh the negatives. Tomoko is a very interesting character and the problems she faces are something that many people, especially girls go through in high school. She has trouble expressing herself to others- not to mention you feel bad for how lonely she is. That’s why you want to root for her to the end. But, the main thing that made me care for her was of course her personality and that she is painfully shy like muah over here. This girl is hilarious and basically every otaku’s spirit animal. She is a weird and crazy chick that is hands down epic. Reason why you don’t care that the show hardly has any memorable supporting characters.Now, the things I disliked about her character is her strong belief that she needs to be popular and also her lame attempts in becoming so. I know she is lonely and she does deserve close friends- but in the show’s twelve episode run she never realized that life in high school isn’t the end of the world. Not to mention, the actions she takes to get friends or become popular make me just nod my head left to right in disappointment. Cause, not even I was this desperate despite the fact I spent almost of my high school life in the corner of the class alone.  Heck, I still do in college!One thing that bugged me, is that no one came to Kuroki’s aid. Her parents nor her brother ever helped her come out of her shell and neither did her middle school friend. It isn’t hard to realize how shy this girl is and no one supported her at all. I swear, this show would have been a whole lot better if they introduced a character who helps out Kuroki. They were actually hinting at something like later on- however the show ended before it could happen.Watamote is a show that will disappoint many people- because it goes nowhere. Every episode is in the same pattern where you see Tomoko struggle and epically fail. That’s the show in a nutshell and it doesn’t try anything new than that. After a few episodes, it’s get repetitive and you really wish there was more to it than just that. One thing Watamote does well is executing its comedic moments and cause they knock those parts right out of the park. I remember, that there were certain moments where I just freaking lost itThe show tries so hard not to be like those clichéd shoujo and or school anime- and heck even pokes fun at them –not to mention they throw in a  shit tonne of anime references which is enjoyable. But, in the process of doing so- Watamote forgets to actually present a show in which the audience will find satisfying. Our main character hardly changes despite all that happens to her and hence the story suffers a lot from it. Not to mention, the lack of impactful characters is a huge flaw of its own.As for the animation it is pretty standard fair and something that suits this type of show very well. The main issue I have with it would the disappearing faces on the characters- not to mention all the silhouettes. But, some times they played a role at showing how lonely Tomoko really is. The character designs are nothing that original either- well except for Kuroki and her brother. I swear, they look like Moe anime characters after having a bad hangover. I loved their designs as from just looking at these two you are like ""Yep these are geeks who stay up late at night playing hentai games!""The soundtrack for Watamote was very average and it’s basically ‘Moe’ meets metal.  And to be honest I am not a big fan of the opening. The animation is cool- but the lyrics and beat really do not scream greatness for me. One track I really did love from Watamote was called ‘ Tear Breaker’ and that was honestly the only thing that stood out. That song however sounds like it belongs on Fate/Zero’s album though!Lastly, other than its realistic portrayal of a shy and introverted otaku- Watamote also has a good dub. Monica Rial gives an excellent performance as Tomoko Kuroki- and I must admit it’s probably one of my favorite performance of hers. Yes, sometimes I get annoyed how she uses the same voice for most of her characters- but that wasn’t the case Watamote. Yes, you still could tell it’s her- but you can also tell Monica was having fun voicing Tomoki and also did a great job of emoting the character perfectly. The supporting cast members did a great job too and so Emily Neves who was the ADR director did a brilliant job with this dub. The dialogue was entertaining as hell and the cast members really gave it their all.In a nutshell, Watamote is not the worst anime I have seen but it is really disappointing. It could have been something great- but it wasted all of its potential. Instead of developing Tomoko and making her story more interesting- they kept recycling the same gag in hopes that it would stand out and be better than any  other typical school anime. Not to mention- the ending of the show didn’t even feel like it helped conclude the story in any way possible.The show is by no means is boring- and it has some great moments. However, overall the show will make you feel as if you have gained nothing from watching it. And so, I am going to award Watamote with a 6 and that it was ‘Meh!’ If Watamote, does ever get another season I will definitely watch it- with hopes it will fix all the issues I recently addressed. But, I doubt it ever will !', ""(First review. Sorry for the formality, I'm too accustomed to churning out verbose bullshit for university essays.) Watamote is a strong and memorable anime because it offers an evocative and incisive insight into the nature of anxiety. Watamote maps the high school experiences of Tomoko, a chronically anxious, cynical, alienated and occasionally depressed protagonist. I generally judge anime according to its conceptual and emotional complexity. Watamote definitely delivers on the latter but not the former. The narrative doesn't show any particular thematic or character-related development, so it is ultimately limited in its meaningful quality. However, Tomoko's story succeeds in evoking the...ups-and-downs of high school on the smaller stage of an anxiety-ridden life. Watamote uses black humour to present the practical and emotional flux of Tomoko's undertakings in an unaffected, unmoderated way. Tomoko comes up with a lot of initiatives to become popular and secure her sense of identity amongst her peers. Yet each time she tries to implement a scheme, she receives contradictory feedback from her distorted perspective and from her variable real-world experiences. Diverging from the idealistic character empowerment within many different anime-verses, Watamote never attempts to rescue Tomoko from her humiliation through tropes or other convenient plot devices. This is what makes Watamote such an enduringly affective anime. Tomoko remains a complex and realistic protagonist who is both embittered and individualized. We are shown the full, largely static picture of Tomoko's life and personality, gory details included. It is left to the individual viewer to draw their own impressions and decisions.Tomoko's social world appears to be a fairly tolerant (albeit indifferent) one, particularly for high school. Tomoko also retains a loyal, caring friend from middle school and a slightly jaded younger brother. What really holds her back in every potential transformation is her extreme social anxiety and comorbid isolation.  Tomoko frequently visualizes her fundamental social alienation by perceiving surrounding people as grey, non-interactive silhouettes; at some points, she imagines herself as appearing bland or transparent to other people. Tomoko's dark and nondescript colours contrast with the brighter colours of perceived socially functional characters, particularly female ones. Interestingly, Tomoko's insecurity in this area is quite gendered. She worries about drawing too much (or too little) attention as a female, shows some signs of internal misogyny (such as spitefully calling other girls 'sluts') and fantasises about presenting an ideal feminine persona. I think this is an interesting and important insight, as it suggests how women may experience anxiety in particularized ways. Watamote's portrayal of Tomoko as a socially anxious girl may offers a valuable counterpart to other comparable depictions of anxiety (like Satou's in NHK). Overall, Watamote is an absorbing anime that evokes a range of visceral emotions and invites an empathetic understanding of social anxiety. ups-and-downs of high school on the smaller stage of an anxiety-ridden life.

As i like particularly everything that turn around from this thematic, I watched this anime without knowing what to expect, for finally be disappointed.Let\'s start with his main problem : His main character, Tomoko Kuroki.What bothers me with this character, this is the role that fits in this anime.Tomoko Kuroki is a shut-in who entered in high school and wants to be popular, but she is so antisocial that when she trying to speak with someone, she becomes very uncomfortable....She spends her days playing Visual Novels and make references to the Japanese pop culture.The problem is here, the anime is full of references to the shovel, like Kiseijuu or Death Note. But what is the use ? To make easy referenced humor and satisfy the brainless spectator, happy to see a reference to his favorite anime.Besides, let\'s talk about the humor of WataMote. Besides greasy sexual jokes, WataMote is what might be called a Cringe Comedy, which is a kind of comedy where the intention is to make the audience laugh but also make him uncomfortable and generally the main character is a victim of this humor, which is also the case for WataMote. But here, it doesn\'t work because : One, most of the scenes which are supposed to be funny because uncomfortable are not funny because, Two, the humor is focuses on Tomoko.The scenes of WataMote where I was supposed to laugh was when Tomoko was stressing to death because she was trying to talk to people, and then when she was acting weird because she is dumb (or so extremely awkward). But not only, it\'s not funny, but in addition, that becomes painful to watch, and I come to prefer Tomoko than the anime itself (which is paradoxical for a character that was created to be hateful and obnoxious).And it\'s even more unbearable when i see minor characters who completely don\'t care about Tomoko (except at certain moments). I take for example the beginning of episode 6, where Tomoko\'s mother said that she\'s fine than usual by his usual dark circles that have disappeared. So that means she knew her daughter wasn\'t well but she was doing nothing for help her, thanks Mom (because Dad appears only in ONE episode).And when it\'s not the characters, it\'s the story itself. Because WataMote repeat the same narrative scheme for 12 episodes (""Tomoko trying to accomplish something, but it fails"") and doesn\'t evolve the main character. The only time I expected to see Tomoko evolve are immediately defused by a joke like ""It was a dream lol"" and it\'s very frustrating.But I assure you, WataMote has qualities. The animation is not ugly even if she has her ups and downs. The OST is not very memorable but still nice to hear, special mention to the opening which in addition has a good music, shows us the true Tomoko (symbolically).As you may have read, I didn\'t really like WataMote and I don\'t recommend this. However, if you want a good anime with the theme of shut-ins, I can only recommend you to watch the very good ""NHK ni Yōkoso!""

I originally started watching this anime back in 2014ish and while I never got to finish it, I had my Nan make a cosplay of her costume of Tomoko. I finally got around to finishing it here in 2020.This anime makes me feel some hardcore feelings.Tomoko is ever so relatable, her awkward, weird, and downright seemingly creepy personality makes her feel like the most human anime character I have ever seen in my 8 years of...watching anime.No one I have spoken to has heard of this anime, and it sucks, because this anime is amazing. Each episode follows its own plot which overall contributes to the main goal: becoming popular. But this anime is more realist than any others, because Tomoko isn't popular, and she will never be.

I only give this rating when a show is not only perfect, but expands my horizons with regard to what I think is possible with the medium.I\'d never thought it was possible to relate to an anime so much as I did with WataMote.  The few characters that are featured are written with a brutally realistic depth, and the show is the only example of what I might call ""Slice of True Life"".  The realistic juxtaposition of narcissism and depression incarnated in Tomoko Kuroki belies a character...depth and understanding of humanity usually only displayed by therapists and other psychology professionals.  There was never a choice made with regard to the writing that I didn\'t find believable and, on a fundamental level, correct for the character.  Lying to people relentlessly, cheating, mentally insulting strangers, every bit of it was exactly who I was in middle school.  The way she is utterly alone in her pain is almost never expressed in anime, but this show treats loneliness like an old friend, joking with it, laughing as it dies inside.  This is so much closer to the reality of being a lonely but narcissistic kid.  The meta-commentary never ceases to be hilarious, which at first I thought might just be unintentional, but in the beginning of the OVA they pretty much spell out that they understand the metacritical implications of their storywriting.  Some people say this show is too cringey, but I usually hate schadenfreude comedy and I love this show.  It feels less to me like they\'re trying to get the audience to laugh at her than it feels like the audience is laughing at her despite the author\'s wish to engender sympathy, which of course is icing on the metacritical cake.I could write an essay on WataMote, so I\'ll stop here.  Suffice to say I think this is the best Slice of Life anime ever, and that I\'d recommend this anime to absolutely anyone. depth and understanding of humanity usually only displayed by therapists and other psychology professionals.

They can be oblivious, lonely, disconnected from the world or fixated with popularity. And, somehow, the protagonist of Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! is all of these things.Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (No Matter How I Look At It, It\'s You Guys\' Fault I\'m Unpopular!), often shortened as WataMote, is a 2013 comedy anime produced by the studio Silver Link. Its director is Shin Oonuma, who also was responsable for Kokoro Connect and Baka to Test.Kuroki Tomoko is an otaku that just began high school expecting to be popular. After...a couple of months, she realizes she is not popular in any way, actually, she hasn\'t talked to anyone at school yet. This realization makes her even more fixated with popularity, which makes her able to go to any lengths to accomplish her objective.WataMote is a comedy, but it does have a setting with a lot of potential to develop its characters. However, it is too focused on the comedy to make any kind of progress character or storywise. All of this results in a storyline that can simply be summarized in one sentence: Tomoko wants to be popular.Tomoko could have had a fairly strong development and multiple opportunities to do that arose during the course of the anime, sadly, they were completely wasted. Through the overwhelming part of the anime, she doesn\'t change or evolve in any way whatsoever, and when it finally does happen it is done in a post-credits scene with no real build up.WataMote boasts of a fairly big supporting the cast, but they are hardly more than caricatures. However, all of them are fairly accurate representations of teenagers, albeit very exaggerated, and this includes Tomoko. These teenagers are all basically looking for one thing: friends, which for Tomoko means popularity.As I already said, WataMote is a comedy, which means most of your attention should be directed to that aspect of the show.Differently from most other anime, WataMote is a comedy about failure. Most of the comedy comes from how far she goes to become popular, such as trying to make herself prettier or deciding to start to work with cakes. But all of these situations are also horribly awkward and a bit depressing (to me), which made it very hard for me to laugh.Another part of the comedy (the one I enjoyed more) comes from the metalinguistical references. Constantly, the protagonist speaks of other anime and their story in a more comical way. Also, it criticizes some genres of anime, for example: the anime made for the so-called ""moe pigs"".WataMote truly above average aspects are technical, however.It is insanely pretty and knows how to use colors to express motions. The use of color is masterful, as is the use of other effects. Most of the time Tomoko is at school, the setting becomes black-and-white to portrayal her disconnect to that world, which is a fairly interesting characteristic.The voice acting is also masterful. Tomoko\'s gruff and assured internal voice makes her sound like a complete badass, but, whenever she speaks up, we are reminded of her exterior: that of a lonely and small girl. This duality is only made possible because of the work of her voice actress, Izumi Kitta.WataMote\'s soundtrack and its usage is also top-notch. The tracks enhance the scenes in a fairly wonderful way and the usage of the OP is fairly interesting. The sound design as a whole is great, with some effects making the fails of Tomoko even more evident.WataMote was, to me, a mixed bag. With wonderful visual sense and great soundtrack, its ""literary"" aspects were severely lacking in comparison. Relatable and ""real-seeming"" characters were actually just one-sided empty shells. The comedy didn\'t work for me, I never laughed out loud during any of its 12 episodes.WataMote is a strange comedy that focuses on the awkwardness. My recommendation is that you give the first episode a try: if you find it funny, continue watching and, if you don\'t, stop with no regrets, the rest is more-or-less the same. a couple of months, she realizes she is not popular in any way, actually, she hasn\'t talked to anyone at school yet.

It does follow some clichés but doesn\'t rely on them to move the plot along.First off, the premise of this story isn\'t that much of an attention-grabber, compared to other anime. However, the simple fact of it revolving around a high schooler who has severe social anxiety, and spends most of her time playing dating sims, that was enough for me to be interested. After all, we all want to know: does she improve? Will she somehow be able to make friends who will coerce her to be more comfortable in her own skin?I\'ll only be...discussing three characters:♦ Tomoko Kuroki (main character)♦ Tomoki Kuroki (her younger brother)♦ Yu Naruse (Tomoko\'s closest friend from middle school)Tomoko\'s a very delusional, very lonely person. And for a good reason: she has no friends at her new high school and the only friend she\'s got goes to a completely different high school. She does her best to improve herself by trying to engage in conversations with her brother and by utilizing what she learns from dating sims, to apply irl. Needless to say, none of these really work. Whenever she observes her fellow classmates, namely her female peers, she curses them and claims that they\'re typical ""bimbos"" who are just boy-crazy. So... she\'s a bit hypocritical in that sense.At the end of the day, you can\'t help but feel sorry for Tomoko and the different shenanigans she comes up with to try and socialize. I feel that she\'s a bit lovable in the sense that she can be relatable. All she needs is a reliable friend and some good healthy lovin\'! They didn\'t have her immediately improve over time and she continued having difficulties befriending people. Nothing much actually changed. She\'s definitely a very flawed character, no doubt about that, which is what I really appreciated from this anime.Now for Tomoko\'s younger brother, Tomoki. He doesn\'t play much of a role in the story other than providing more comic relief. There\'s actually a handful of times where they share tsundere heartwarming moments between each other. The thing that I appreciated most about their siblingship was the fact that it wasn\'t cliché. They don\'t get along very well, nor are they that close. They squabble but not in a way where it gets annoying after a while. There were also a lot of heartwarming moments where you get a blast from the past and see how the two siblings got along when they were kids. Truly ""awww~"" material.Tomoko\'s only real friend, Yu, shows up a handful of times throughout the anime. She went from being average looking in middle school to transforming completely as soon as they started high school into your typical kawaii chick. I admit, I first thought that she was going to slowly start abandoning Tomoko but throughout the series, Yu was able to still hangout with her and be there for her as a friend even if they no longer go to the same school. And she isn\'t a horrible, fake person either. That again didn\'t follow normal clichés where the best friend does a complete 180 and turns into a full on b*tch and leaves the protagonist hanging. No, she stuck around. However, the thing I didn\'t quite understand about Tomoko was how she\'d think lowly of Yu, even going so far as to calling her a b*tch just because she wore short skirts and was in general... cute. I\'m sure it was just Tomoko\'s envious personality talking, but it did seem like she took Yu for granted more often than not.There\'s not much to say about the art style. I feel that it\'s your standard run-of-the-mill animation. Although there were plenty of parts where the artists got to play around with Cubism during parts where Tomoko was really losing it lol.Nothing much to say about the soundtrack either. The intro features a screamo song that emphasizes Tomoko\'s disdain of the world around her. The outro is a more light-hearted, cutesy type of song.Overall, even though I didn\'t thoroughly enjoy the anime, I did very much appreciate how it was out of the norm. They didn\'t have any character that was too perfect or too obnoxious. Even the ending itself was pretty meh with no real happy or sad ending. I feel it was a somewhat realistic take on what could happen to a person with severe social anxiety, trying to break out of their shell. discussing three characters:♦ Tomoko Kuroki (main character)♦ Tomoki Kuroki (her younger brother)♦ Yu Naruse (Tomoko\'s closest friend from middle school)Tomoko\'s a very delusional, very lonely person.

All she does is play games, read manga and watch anime. She suffers from a horrible case of social anxiety and although she wants to fit in and have friends, it's incredibly difficult for her. Each episode involves Kuroki trying to come up with ways for others to notice her and admire her but everything she tries to do comes from the games that she plays and the anime that she watches. Nothing goes right and she is alienated by her classmates.It's very weird but everything that Kuroki thinks, says and experiences is all...too similar to me. When I was in school, I didn't have any friends, and I barely talked to anyone. I suffered from social anxiety and never knew how to talk to others. The things I see Kuroki do to try and fit in all incredibly similar to the things I tried to do. Just like her, I would get social advice from TV and video games and try to use it in real life (which didn't work). Just like her, I'd lie to try and make myself seem cooler. Just like her, I'd try to develop a persona that everyone would admire. I'd embarrass myself and feel pretty terrible and lonely. While watching Kuroki live her life, all I could picture was myself in her shoes, because I've been there, that's how I lived my teenage years. It's really hard trying to fit in when you can't talk to people. But what I really loved is that Kuroki never gave up on trying to fit in. In each episode she would think of something new to try and get people to notice her.Although social anxiety is really sad and not exactly something you should get comedy out of, it was pretty funny to watch Kuroki live her sad depressing life. It is cringe comedy, so if you don't like seeing cringyness then you might not enjoy it. But one of the main reason I enjoyed it so much is because I know what it's like. Kuroki's personality towards others is so perfect and what she thinks of everyone is absolute gold. Kuroki's character is so perfect, it's amazing how well developed of a character she is.As for the sound, I did watch it dubbed and although Monica Rial is probably the English voice actress that I hate the most, I think she did an amazing job making Kuroki as cringy as possible. Dubs always have their flaws, but I think this one was pretty good. The music, I thought was amazing, the opening scared the crap out me the first time because I wasn't expecting it, but it's absolutely one my favorite openings.I thought this anime was amazing, it really projects social anxiety in a realistic and comedic way. I can say first hand that the Slice of Life nature of this anime is incredibly accurate. This anime will make you cringe a bit but it's still really fun to watch.Likes:-Kuroki, almost everything about her is exactly how I was when I was in high school and kinda still am today. It's actually pretty eerie how similar we are and I'd like to know how many others feel the same way. We are not alone.-The social anxiety aspect of the show is pretty cringe but it's absolutely accurate-The references to games/anime were pretty fun to watchDislikes:-I'm not a big fan of cringe comedy, so at times it was a bit hard to watch too similar to me.

It deals with a socially inept girl named Tomoko Kuroki going through school and growing up as an unpopular, ""cringe"" teenager.The anime, however, is a soulless cringe-fest with none of the charm of the manga. The characters are portrayed so flatly, and instead of being subtly effective at portraying awkward, clumsy, or inept social behavior, it relies on in-your-face...cringe that\'s difficult to watch.It\'s a shame that this anime shares the same name of the much, much superior manga counterpart. cringe that\'s difficult to watch.It\'s a shame that this anime shares the same name of the much, much superior manga counterpart.', ""Note: This is my first time making a review for an anime.To start with this review, I would like to say to those who haven't watched the series: Please be patient. This anime is not really for the weak hearted but doesn't mean you'll gonna cry a lot as it has it's comedic points. Like me, you might feel disappointed, not of the anime, but of the main character, Tomoki. Later on, you might also feel sympathy and would hate the writer. You don't have to be because that's how it should be. It gives us a subtle point-of-view of a person that could be...in real life. Which is kind of the vision of the writer so put away your hatred (if there is any).Looking at some parts, the fan service does come often. I mean with our heroine being portrayed as someone unattractive, it makes sense to make the other ladies alluring. Sometimes it's where the comedy comes to play. The real comedic parts that this production have really prepared are the vignettes from other anime series. Scenes that are exaggerated, fantasies of our heroine, and even comments concerning those series in parody.Speaking of comedy, as I've said, it's not for those who get traumatized by some depressing school life that they had but would be as an exaggeration on my side. When I watch our heroine failing, I would laugh a bit because like they say 'It's funny because it's true' and I would know by experience. Later on, I'd feel bad for our heroine and would like to help improve herself. She is suffering from social anxiety and her personality makes it difficult for her to develop her communication skills but she's getting there (if the writer would thinks so). Thinking of this made me realize of what I have to change more in my life. So I'm saying this series could be helpful also. That's why, I continued watching till the end.

But since she’s so socially awkward, she fails at every attempt of talking to people.First of: Great opening, less great ending sing, but still one of the best animes in my life. It’s so good that I couldn’t binge watch it, as I wanted to enjoy it as long as I could. It’s humour is on top, and I don’t really remember how many times my dad had to enter my room, wondering why I’m screaming in laughter....Oh father, it’s simple. I’m just watching Watamote.But Watamote has it’s more painfully awkward situations too; like the moment where Kuroki dropped her coffee at a café after pouring in way too much honey, cinnamon and chocolate syrup.But let's not forget the fact that the main character had a vibrator. Yes.Overall, I liked because it’s funny, but also because I sometimes can relate to her, as she:1. Calls the popular girls “bitches”.2.Too shy to make an order at McDonaldsI recommend this anime.

Examining how it feels to really be complete wallpaper in school social life is really interesting to me personally and something I can honestly relate to. Trying everything to fit in at all and just being too weird and badly adjusted for anything to take effect, how becoming pretentious and creating fantasy scenarios in your head can be an honest means of escape. Reminded me of high school which opened some old wounds but the jokes were hilarious. "", ""This anime hits way too close to home and makes me cringe for all the right reasons. It reminds me (and hopefully others like me) that we can/are/used to be self-absorbed and still be weirdoes. That cringe behavior isn't only a statistical eventuality but an unfortunate commonality. Especially in our formative years. We all want to be characters like in our favorite shows, movies, or video games. But in reality, we are all a lot more like Tomoko. And thats the brilliance of this series. It revels in being honest and human, especially the parts of that that we would rather not be (not in...a genocidal maniac kind of way, just in a 'jesus the s*** I did in High School...' sort of way).TL;DR: This one aint for those who are afraid to look too hard at themselves.

And I envy you.I understand that some people never have to live like Tomoko, and I do genuinely envy these people that the never have to see her life as something relatable.I, on the other hand, painstakingly saw how my life was animated in front of me:* Envying socially successful peers while being forced to overhear their plans that you will never achieve.* Coping with your unpopularity by being sanctimonious and hypocritically considering yourself holier-than-thou for being unlike them, while you actually envy them and their life.* Actively choosing a personality...for yourself, hoping it will change your life.* Spending all your free time in your room, wanting to do something else but know knowing what or how.* Facing inescapable virginity because you genuinely have no clue about how to change it, being so desperate as to long for sexual violence.* Enjoying abusive and self-degrading porn.* Having so few social interactions over time that they are countable, and therefore anxiously stuttering whenever someone unexpectedly talks to you.* Shivering at the slightest contact with the opposite gender and imagining movie scenes to come out of it.* Watching friends ace through life and achieve unimaginable success, while having to swallow your violent jealousy of their perfect lives.* Imagining a future of your life turning around into joyful mediocrity, and believing your fantasy to the point of becoming delusional.And also... if my life had a theme song, I’d scream my frustration to the sound of the world's loudest instruments. And the music video would be me throwing my body back and forth while shattering chains and smashing glass.I’m sorry it had to be like this, Tomoko. I’m sorry that this is the reality you were given. You really don’t deserve the life you were thrown into, nobody does.But please try to believe me when I say this: you are not alone. An entire world of people out there are crying with you.

The show gives back what you bring to the table emotionally, which is both painful and uplifting.  I would not go into Watamote expecting to leave satisfied and this is okay - it gives you as much as it can without compromising its identity.  Ultimately, since the show is about you, I would glean what wisdom you can from it and let your own life be its happy ending.Of course, Watamote is first and foremost a comedy!  It sets up simple but satisfying jokes and executes perfectly....This is not a rushed or humor; bits are allowed to breathe and the viewer can usually feel the resolution coming long beforehand.  One of the few animes I've seen that manages to be frequently laugh-out-loud funny, Watamote is very approachable from a western comedic perspective.The OP is close to being great, but unfortunately it's not.  Despite being visually perfect and starting off strong and rooted in metal, it quickly gets distracted, turning first to a more J-rock sound, giving us a 4-bar jazz interlude, flirting briefly with its darker roots, and eventually terminating in a truly cheesy melody and rhythm.  If it had committed fully to the aesthetic that it portrays visually and in the first few bars, it would have been a fantastic OP.  The ED holds up much better.  It's a fairly typical Japanized electro-house tune, but it thrives in its simplicity and in the overlay of our desperate protagonists voice with the choir behind.  This outro gets its message of acceptance across very well in an elegant juxtaposition with the theme of defiance given in the intro.

In the case of Watamote, I ended up watching it because a friend showed me the opening sequence, told me Tomoko Kuroki is me as a Japanese school girl, then got mad when I wouldn’t shut up about how fucking perfect Tomoko is.The show is like Welcome to the NHK lite. A girl, Tomoko Kuroki, is completely socially awkward, demented, in love with anime and nerd...culture, and doesn’t understand how the world works.  It follows her life as a freshman in high school, a world where everything sucks, no one is her friend, and she can barely do anything without failing. Most of the failure come out of normal, everyday social situations while the rest come from demented fantasies. It’s a show aimed at a demographic that rightly knows who they are and rightly understand the situations that Tomoko gets into. The show gets a lot of hate from some people who rightly know that they are just like Tomoko and reject the fact that someone made a show aimed at them, but to me, I’m not afraid to laugh at myself. Just like Welcome to the NHK, it’s there for people with social problems and total nerds who aren’t afraid to look at themselves in the mirror and laugh.The anime follows its respective manga pretty well, in fact it rarely deviates from the source material. Sometimes the anime puts a part from the manga before it happened in the manga, but that doesn’t matter. The problem the anime faces as opposed to the manga, which managed to stay pretty balanced, is that there is a slump in the middle of the series where a few of the scenarios and episodes fall into general comedy tropes. The most embarrassing offender is the panty episode. While chuckle-worthy at points, it deviates so far from the fairly original comedy of the previous few episodes. And then there’s a part where Tomoko wants to get raped on the train because she feels it would make her feel popular. While kind of funny and contributing to that skewed view of popularity that she has, it’s not as relatable or likable as her previous and later attempts at popularity.The show is excellent when it goes through real life scenarios rather than crazy ones. The episode where she goes to Starbucks, doesn’t know what the hell she’s ordering, and ends up screwing up royally after getting her coffee is funny, but also really cute and sad in a way. It’s when she’s doing very normal things that you feel so bad that she screws up so much or can’t manage to do it. Another example is the very first episode where she has to say goodbye to her teacher. Those moments of social awkwardness that can be related to are where the show shines. It’s a new kind of humor that is funny because it’s realistic and relatable for many people. Which is why some of the more outlandish attempts at humor fall flat; they just don’t seem to fit in. They fit Tomoko’s character, but they don’t fit the style of comedy.As far as supporting characters go Tomoki is Tomoko’s brother and a rather unattached and unlikable fellow. Her mom is just there to be a mom. Her best friend Yuu is a busty—as Tomoko would call her—“bitch” with very little personality. But that’s one of the main points of the show. That’s why I can understand the faceless background characters. Tomoko lives in a world where everyone has the same personality, everyone is looking for a girlfriend to bang. It’s seemingly one of the reasons she is the way she is, she sees the world as being totally faceless and everyone to be without a distinguishing personality.The style of the comedy combined with the style of animation and great directing really lead to a very unique show that has a few slip ups along the way, but manages to continue being funny and original for much of its run.

I hope you enjoy!)First thing I gotta say about this anime, it will make your cringe, it will make you laugh and honestly this anime is a little sad. Hey I rymed there! So when I finished this anime off I thought it would be a perfect anime to create a review about so here we are today. Just a warning though there are spoilers in this anime review to help with my points. If you haven't watched the anime you should leave and come back when you...have watched it.Like I said earlier this anime may make you cringe or laugh or both at the same time. Some of the things that our MC Kuroki Tomoki do are funny but also cringe-worthly like when in episode one she tried to look more attravtive but ended up looking... well i can't find a word to explain it other than ugly.Tomoki herself has really nothing special going for her other than she is a kinda cute anime girl. Tomoki however has a goal for high school, she wants to become popular! The only issue with that is she's a complete introvert who has troubles talking with her own teachers!Whenever someone talks to her other than he family and Yuu-chan she starts to freak out and talks in broken up and quiet sentances.Also a lot of the stuff she does just makes her come off as a bad person, an example is at the end of episode 11 she cheats in a Yu-Gi-Oh match against a bunch of kids or how she treats her brother poorly throughout the episode even when he stayed home from school sick.The Music perfectly fits the anime and the Opening is amazing! First off I thought the opening was kinda weird to be in a Slice of Life anime but after a while of watching it you kinda get used to it and now I even have it downloaded on my phone, which I am using to record this video!The Art and Animation was good, nothing special for me to talk about here so this section is short.Overall I really enjoyed WataMote, it made me cringe a few times but laugh alot at those cringe moments! have watched it.Like I said earlier this anime may make you cringe or laugh or both at the same time.

First off I thought the opening was kinda weird to be in a Slice of Life anime but after a while of watching it you kinda get used to it and now I even have it downloaded on my phone, which I am using to record this video!The Art and Animation was good, nothing special for me to talk about here so this section is short.Overall I really enjoyed WataMote, it made me cringe a few times but laugh alot at those cringe moments!"", ""WataMote. It's painful, no matter if you like it or hate it.To me, it was pretty funny at times, (and I think everyone agrees that the story with the massage-machine and the visual novel was hilarious) but at other times it was painful to watch Tomoko. To me, that pain made the comedy better, because as I imagined myself going through the same situations, I would feel extreme agony from the awkwardness, and if I was in that situation, I would pull out immediately and try to blend back into the norm. I can't imagine what lies at the end of the dark social paths...that Tomoko often treads, and that makes the ends of those paths more enjoyable and funny to me. But I can definitely see the flip-side. You hate this show because it tortures Tomoko, who is similar to people in real life. So, I can't in good conscious recommend this anime to anyone, since it's pretty much a coin toss whether you like it or don't. Watch with caution.But the art was beautiful. It used a pretty unique way to show lighting, using sharp contrasts rather than the usual soft blending. I thought that was pretty. And the opening song is agreed upon to be very good and representative of Tomoko's emotions. And Tomoko's voice is pretty well done. that Tomoko often treads, and that makes the ends of those paths more enjoyable and funny to me. But I can definitely see the flip-side.

Not that this show was bad, quite the opposite really. I myself have struggled with anxiety throughout my life. Not to the extent that Tomoko has with her intense social anxiety but had to deal with none the less. So many times I was cringing really hard mainly due the fact that I related on a very hard level with what was going on. The imagery used in any of Tomoko\'s ""dreams"" was easily the highlight charm of the show. Every time we see Tomoko fantasize about being popular or even her reaction to whatever scheme blew up in...her face is largely played up for comedy.But that\'s not to say that the show didn\'t have nuance to it. Every single one of these moments were very poignant in how they went wrong or highlighted one of Tomoko\'s many many flaws and I loved that. Speaking from personal experience through some of my worst anxious moments these scenes conveyed a clear message as to what was going through Tomoko\'s head through it\'s intense imagery that just resonated with me.Tomoko is not the world greatest person obviously, but the fact that she tries and tries to make her life a bit better (even though it\'s far fetched and sometimes insane the stuff she thinks of) just makes her really endearing as a character. If you\'re someone who has dealt with, or is currently dealing with anxiety or depression I would 100% give this one a watch. her face is largely played up for comedy.But that\'s not to say that the show didn\'t have nuance to it.

', 'Watamote or ""its ur guy\'s fault im not popular"" can sometimes be deemed as one of the most relatable series to have come out of the anime industry. Especially the particular character Tomoko. Shes nevertheless a complete mess when it comes to social interactions, deals badly with conflict and cant form proper relationships with people without messing up. Many criticize tomoko for doing the things she does. This is because they label her as an ""introvert"" and leave it as that. Its implied that introverts would never mess up with the situations tomoko are in because they would not get in them in the 1st...place. But people dont realize that Tomoko is far from being JUST an introvert. Through each episode we grasp bits of tomoko\'s personality and it can be safe to infer that she has serious social anxiety which is a disorder to be clear. She is even unable to properly speak to people without running away and puking it out later. This is not normal introvert behavior. Another misconception id liek to get out of the way is tomoko\'s lack of development. Clearly at the end of the series she hasn\'t changed at all. At least popularity wise. But she has changed ehr mindset about life in general, and this is a key point many dismiss. Tomoko through the end of the series states ""  it doesnt really matter"" which couldnt be more true. She realizes that highschool is just a temporary phase and the whole social status within are as irrelavant as highschool itself. She accepts the way she is, her hobbies and intrests and the way she lives in contrast to the beggining of the series, where she would constantly change her personality and perfrom silly antics to ahive her goals.Story 8/10The story is pretty basic itself, high school girl in high school, going on about life in a cringe yet hilarious fashionCharacters 10/10Tomoko in general interests me alot, not because i particular relate in her extent.

The ups and downs I went through, all over just twelve episodes.The story, basically goes nowhere. No huge plot development, no big grand scheme. But it\'s very relatable. This is one of the few shows where people can actually be like ""gosh, that\'s so much like me."" And they cringe at the thought of it. You feel sorry for her while laughing at her at the same time.

Everyday things in Tomoko\'s life are made interesting.The art is average. What can I say? Nothing remarkable. Nothing horrible. I did like Tomoko\'s different faces though, very entertaining.The opening was okay. The ending was cute. Again, nothing extraordinary  here. Hatsune Miku sung one ending which made me happy.

She is really quite the character, definitely not boring, I will say that. She is hilarious, perverted, depressing, and it\'s wonderful yet horrible. So many mixed feelings, but you can\'t help but love her.If enjoying means cringing every time Tomoko did something stupid (so all the time) and laughing my ass off while she does it, then yes I did. It was a good 12 episodes and kept me entertained. There isn\'t a very amazing ending, but really, what did we expect to happen?

But because it actively goes out of its way to never be that.Story 4/10:WataMote is a character study that follows Tomoko Kuroki, a caricature of otaku culture, that suffers from her crushing social anxiety, awkward demeanor, poor hygiene, and unfulfilled desires for affection. The series follows Tomoko in her various efforts to attract the attention of men while repeatedly progressing and regressing in both confidence and delusion.An issue:Cringe comedy is hard to get right, and when...it's over you're supposed to be able to laugh.Chuunibyou is a series that does this very thing really well and delivers its comedy while making it easy to understand the inherent social ineptitude of its protagonists.WataMote, on the other hand, is funny at first but continues to regress its humor until the joke is no longer funny and you can only cringe and feel pity for the protagonist.Art 5/10:The animation is fairly fine and the art style works. The protagonist isn't supposed to be seen as a cute shut in. Tomoko's character isn't an idealized Konata or meant to be likable, so her character design really tells you most of what you need to know about her before you've even seen an episode.There are several on the nose anime references you'll see along the way.Sound 6/10:The OP for WataMote is heavy and aggressive, like the inner thoughts of the protagonist. The visuals combined with the track provide a depiction of Tomoko trying to break out of these chains of social retardation and it's interesting. The VAs all do their parts fine, and the ED is clever but not notable.Character 7/10:WataMote does realism for every character but Tomoko well. The supporting cast are all surprisingly realistic depictions of high school students and the conversations they would have. These closer to life depictions of students and their lives further emphasizes Tomoko's character.Tomoko is terrifying in how relatable she can be.Her awkward nature and social anxiety are easy to relate to and are a huge part of her flaw as a character. Her lack of hygiene and inability to communicate even to the most minimal degree drive people further away from her. Tomoko has delusional fits as a result of her introversion, but she isn't introspective enough to realize these delusions. She often looks down on others to maintain her superiority complex, even so far as to look down on the only friend she had in middle school reaching out to her, and in moments when even that fails her all of the the mental barriers collapse and you're allowed to see the reality of her character. A lonely, socially inept girl lacking in nearly every aspect of her basic human needs. Her family is either oblivious or neglectful of this fact as shown by her parents inaction and her brother's calous treatment of her.Enjoyment: 3/10Overall: 5/10I didn't enjoy WataMote, but it felt as if I was intended to.We've all been in situations where we've felt an uncomfortable sense of unbelonging. High school can be a rough time for just about anyone, but the support of those close to us mitigates and often outweighs any negative effects traumatic events would otherwise cause on our hormonal psyches at that time. Without that support and those basic human needs being met social regression is inevitable.Everyone knows someone that shares traits with Tomoko, and that's unsettling. it's over you're supposed to be able to laugh.Chuunibyou is a series that does this very thing really well and delivers its comedy while making it easy to understand the inherent social ineptitude of its protagonists.WataMote, on the other hand, is funny at first but continues to regress its humor until the joke is no longer funny and you can only cringe and feel pity for the protagonist.Art 5/10:The animation is fairly fine and the art style works.

It goes on much longer than is comfortable and it\'s very funny.The humour in WataMote is overwhelmingly of the cringey variety and how you deal with that will likely effect your enjoyment of this show. How do you deal with The Office, particularly the British original version? That might get you some of the way to appreciating just how much cringe this show will...put you through.For my part I mostly don\'t deal with cringe-comedy all that well, perhaps because I myself - especially in my teen years - was so painfully cringey and can relate a little too fiercely. Yet despite the above moment being executed in such a way as to elicit a genuine laugh from me, for the most part I didn\'t find WataMote particularly funny, at least not laugh out loud funny. Unlike, say, KonoSuba, this provided me with just a few good laughs, and less than one an episode.So why have I given it such a high rating, you might ask? Especially since I a) don\'t like cringe comedy in general; and b) didn\'t find this particular example to be mould-breaking in terms of how funny it was? Well, it goes back to that aforementioned relatability I mentioned.Now, this is a somewhat controversial point. Writing over at Kotaku (in 2013 - yes, I am late to the party), Richard Eisenbeis described this as the ""most mean-spirited anime [he] has ever watched."" Well on this count, I think it may have flown over his head. Or perhaps it flew over mine. Perhaps the very fact I didn\'t find it supremely funny meant I didn\'t perceive it as poking fun at its protagonist. Certainly the show mainly consists of terrible things happening to our protagonist, Tomoko. Certainly she\'s not much excused from this parade of nightmares, with at least half of it being brought on herself by her own actions. Certainly, the show isn\'t much interested in helping Tomoko out of her predicament. So yeah, I can see how Eisenbeis comes to his conclusion. But I still think he\'s wrong.I mainly think that, because I think this show offers a surprisingly, unusually realistic portrayal of extreme social anxiety.Characters, especially female ones, who are socially isolated and awkward for one reason or another have been done plenty in anime and manga. From Komi-san, to Shouko Nishimiya, to Rikka Takanashi, to Yui Hirasawa, this is a pretty established anime archetype at this point. But Tomoko is wildly different to those examples. This aspect of her character is not meant to make her some moe object of our protective instincts, she is not designed to be an object of our sympathies (though she may well become that), and this isn\'t a story about how some life-changing event or person can magically \'fix\' her.Let me explain who Tomoko Kuroki is. She\'s someone suffering from very pronounced social anxiety who has arguably half a friend - if that - and who wonders why the only people she can speak somewhat normally to are her rather stand-offish brother and her oblivious mother. She deals with her inability to make friends, to be popular, or to find a boyfriend by placing the blame squarely on others. She fantasises about terrible things happening to the \'popular\' kids (pretty much everyone capable of normal human interaction) - like, for example when she imagines the teacher announcing their class is now in a \'Battle Royale\' scenario. In her internal monologue she employs a wide range of insults for everyone around her. She always assumes the worst of people - more a reflection of her own outlook than reality. The English translation of the full Japanese title of the show sums this all up: ""No Matter How I Look At It, It\'s You Guys Fault I\'m Not Popular.""So, right about now you may be thinking that mean-spirited sounds like a pretty accurate description of this show. This is not a character made to be sympathetic and yet she\'s not some privileged and powerful target worthy of mockery. No, the show by targeting her is very much kicking downwards.The problem is, this only works if you run with the assumption that the show really is targeting Tomoko. I don\'t think it is. Because, in truth, Tomoko is -unlike many of these other characters - very, very real. We\'ve all known people like this, even if back in high school we may not have given them much thought. Some of us, to one extent or another, have been this character. I know I\'ve more than once fallen into the trap of blaming others for my flaws, of assuming if I don\'t fit in, it\'s because the group is not deserving of having me. Hell, half the time when people rail against \'normies\', I think this phenomenon is at least partially at work. It\'s easier to assume we\'re part of a special, enlightened elite that the sheep-like masses can\'t understand. This phenomenon is certainly behind \'nice guys\' and incels. It\'s a re-assurance we give ourselves when the world seems to be against us, and it\'s easier than accepting our flaws, much less working on them.But that\'s the thing - Tomoko does work on her flaws. Relentlessly. Whilst her anxiety is chronic and heightened she never actually tumbles into full-blown depression over it, with each episode seeing her renewing her will to go on with a new hair-brained scheme to break through. Her optimism is actually quite astounding in light of the constant obstacles she is thrown. The tragedy is that the one thing truly holding her back - her anxiety disorder - is never the thing she\'s trying to change. And, realistically, for that she probably needs real outside help, but she never really seeks or gets it.And make no mistake - this is a tragedy first and foremost. It is only framed as a comedy to lighten what might otherwise be an unbearably grim tale. And it presents a troubled teen that feels far more real than what we normally see, who just needs that special someone to appear, the whirlwind, eye-opening romance to occur and then - puff! - the anxiety disorder is gone. Reality doesn\'t work that way and that\'s what WataMote shows us and it cuts pretty close to the bone at times, making us uncomfortable in the process.There\'s a tendency in the stories we see across most cultures to assume that there is a nobility in being downtrodden, a tendency to romanticise suffering. WataMote is here to tell us that actually, it\'s just kinda shit. That\'s not an inspiring, or an uplifting thought, but it\'s a true one. And sometimes, just sometimes, a dose of reality and accepting that reality, is, in it\'s own way, what we really need. Perhaps if Tomoko understood this and more readily accepted her situation things would be better. Or maybe they\'d be much worse. It\'s hard to say. After all - there\'s no silver bullet, no magic elixir, no panacaea. There\'s just whatever works best for each person.The narrator in WataMote says Tomoko\'s story doesn\'t matter. It\'s true she isn\'t going to change the world, or save it. But I think we do need brutally honest stories like this sometimes, so in its own way WataMote is important. It\'s not the greatest anime of all time, by any measure, but it is a pretty good one, all things considered.Plus, by the end, you might have built up a much stronger resistance to cringe by sheer exposure.Go watch it is my recommendation. put you through.For my part I mostly don\'t deal with cringe-comedy all that well, perhaps because I myself - especially in my teen years - was so painfully cringey and can relate a little too fiercely. Yet despite the above moment being executed in such a way as to elicit a genuine laugh from me, for the most part I didn\'t find WataMote particularly funny, at least not laugh out loud funny. Unlike, say, KonoSuba, this provided me with just a few good laughs, and less than one an episode.So why have I given it such a high rating, you might ask? Especially since I a) don\'t like cringe comedy in general; and b) didn\'t find this particular example to be mould-breaking in terms of how funny it was? Well, it goes back to that aforementioned relatability I mentioned.Now, this is a somewhat controversial point. Writing over at Kotaku (in 2013 - yes, I am late to the party), Richard Eisenbeis described this as the ""most mean-spirited anime [he] has ever watched."" Well on this count, I think it may have flown over his head. Or perhaps it flew over mine. Perhaps the very fact I didn\'t find it supremely funny meant I didn\'t perceive it as poking fun at its protagonist. Certainly the show mainly consists of terrible things happening to our protagonist, Tomoko. Certainly she\'s not much excused from this parade of nightmares, with at least half of it being brought on herself by her own actions. Certainly, the show isn\'t much interested in helping Tomoko out of her predicament. So yeah, I can see how Eisenbeis comes to his conclusion. But I still think he\'s wrong.I mainly think that, because I think this show offers a surprisingly, unusually realistic portrayal of extreme social anxiety.Characters, especially female ones, who are socially isolated and awkward for one reason or another have been done plenty in anime and manga. From Komi-san, to Shouko Nishimiya, to Rikka Takanashi, to Yui Hirasawa, this is a pretty established anime archetype at this point. But Tomoko is wildly different to those examples. This aspect of her character is not meant to make her some moe object of our protective instincts, she is not designed to be an object of our sympathies (though she may well become that), and this isn\'t a story about how some life-changing event or person can magically \'fix\' her.Let me explain who Tomoko Kuroki is. She\'s someone suffering from very pronounced social anxiety who has arguably half a friend - if that - and who wonders why the only people she can speak somewhat normally to are her rather stand-offish brother and her oblivious mother. She deals with her inability to make friends, to be popular, or to find a boyfriend by placing the blame squarely on others. She fantasises about terrible things happening to the \'popular\' kids (pretty much everyone capable of normal human interaction) - like, for example when she imagines the teacher announcing their class is now in a \'Battle Royale\' scenario. In her internal monologue she employs a wide range of insults for everyone around her. She always assumes the worst of people - more a reflection of her own outlook than reality. The English translation of the full Japanese title of the show sums this all up: ""No Matter How I Look At It, It\'s You Guys Fault I\'m Not Popular.""So, right about now you may be thinking that mean-spirited sounds like a pretty accurate description of this show. This is not a character made to be sympathetic and yet she\'s not some privileged and powerful target worthy of mockery. No, the show by targeting her is very much kicking downwards.The problem is, this only works if you run with the assumption that the show really is targeting Tomoko. I don\'t think it is. Because, in truth, Tomoko is -unlike many of these other characters - very, very real. We\'ve all known people like this, even if back in high school we may not have given them much thought. Some of us, to one extent or another, have been this character. I know I\'ve more than once fallen into the trap of blaming others for my flaws, of assuming if I don\'t fit in, it\'s because the group is not deserving of having me. Hell, half the time when people rail against \'normies\', I think this phenomenon is at least partially at work. It\'s easier to assume we\'re part of a special, enlightened elite that the sheep-like masses can\'t understand. This phenomenon is certainly behind \'nice guys\' and incels. It\'s a re-assurance we give ourselves when the world seems to be against us, and it\'s easier than accepting our flaws, much less working on them.But that\'s the thing - Tomoko does work on her flaws. Relentlessly. Whilst her anxiety is chronic and heightened she never actually tumbles into full-blown depression over it, with each episode seeing her renewing her will to go on with a new hair-brained scheme to break through. Her optimism is actually quite astounding in light of the constant obstacles she is thrown. The tragedy is that the one thing truly holding her back - her anxiety disorder - is never the thing she\'s trying to change. And, realistically, for that she probably needs real outside help, but she never really seeks or gets it.And make no mistake - this is a tragedy first and foremost. It is only framed as a comedy to lighten what might otherwise be an unbearably grim tale. And it presents a troubled teen that feels far more real than what we normally see, who just needs that special someone to appear, the whirlwind, eye-opening romance to occur and then - puff! - the anxiety disorder is gone. Reality doesn\'t work that way and that\'s what WataMote shows us and it cuts pretty close to the bone at times, making us uncomfortable in the process.There\'s a tendency in the stories we see across most cultures to assume that there is a nobility in being downtrodden, a tendency to romanticise suffering. WataMote is here to tell us that actually, it\'s just kinda shit. That\'s not an inspiring, or an uplifting thought, but it\'s a true one. And sometimes, just sometimes, a dose of reality and accepting that reality, is, in it\'s own way, what we really need. Perhaps if Tomoko understood this and more readily accepted her situation things would be better. Or maybe they\'d be much worse. It\'s hard to say. After all - there\'s no silver bullet, no magic elixir, no panacaea. There\'s just whatever works best for each person.The narrator in WataMote says Tomoko\'s story doesn\'t matter. It\'s true she isn\'t going to change the world, or save it. But I think we do need brutally honest stories like this sometimes, so in its own way WataMote is important.

The character is certainly not portrayed as a stunning beauty queen but nevertheless above average looking; a silent, cute student that isn\'t bullied, whom no one has any ill will towards that is just...ignored simply because he doesn\'t say a word in class. Somehow they managed to create an entire show about a character who rarely ever speaks to anyone and is morbidly afraid of doing so by just playing the character\'s internal monologue which offers a resemblance of conversation.Some say it\'s a comedy but I haven\'t laughed once watching it and it\'s not like I thought it was a poor attempt at humour either; I didn\'t really see the attempt at humour. Pretty much every episode repeats a similar formula of Tomoko coming with a far-fetched plan to be noticed and popular only for it to fail because it\'s absolutely absurd and Tomoko can\'t seem to graps the basic thing that all he need do is go out and talk to people to probably be noticed and make friends due to being far too afraid of that.So what would the appeal be? Some described the show as ""anti-moe""; we\'re dealing with a character that many would consider to be terribly cute in its own deranged way; it\'s a moe slice of life show that does everything differently — instead of the cute, exuberant successful secondary school student we get a cute shut-in that lacks even the most basic of social skills and suffers from crippling social anxiety. I\'m fairly certain that the only way one would possibly enjoy this show is if one think the main character is terribly cute for without it there\'s not much left to it.

How can we portray the life of a NEET introvert to be so unattractive that it forces people to want to live their high school lives better? Watamote depicts most of the cringiest moments of people's high school lives in such an obvious fashion that it makes the viewer look back at their own lives.This show is a slice of life comedy following Tomoko Kuroki, a socially awkward first year in high school who has big plans to finally become popular in...high school. The only problem is that her only knowledge about how to become popular comes from video games, manga, online forums and TV. Most of the things she tries are very hollow, superficial things that any cute, normal-ditzy girl could pull off in a cinch. However, they just make Tomoko seem creepy and give her more social anxiety and push her further away from her goal of becoming popular. If you love to see people fail and want to revel in awkward embarrassment, this show is for you.Like I said earlier, this show really accomplished what it wanted to, so well in fact, that it gets really hard to watch at times. Most shows have characters that do awkward or stupid things that don't work out, but those characters typically feign embarrassment and actually are self aware of what they're doing and it turns into irony. This is not the case in Watamote and every situation that Tomoko gets herself in is completely her fault and she bares the consequences in the worst ways imaginable. For me, this comedy became overbearing over time and I had to put the show down for a while. I don't think it helped that I binged 7 episodes in a day, but I think the point is still valid. I really liked the VA for Tomoko as she truly captured what I imagine a NEET introverted Japanese girl to sound like, which is not cute at all. The OP and ED are also very catchy in their own, very different ways. Another great thing thing show does is their references to other anime. They reference K-On, Haruhi Suzumiya, Evangelion among others and they all seem pretty on point in timing and comedic value. That being said, this show feels like it isn't for the new-comers in the anime community. I feel that having a larger knowledge of anime/Japanese culture helps appreciate the show for the viewer. I would only recommend this show to friends who have seen quite a bit of SoL anime and anime in general.Overall, Watamote was pretty entertaining until I got burnt out on the premise which it achieves whole-heartedly. The middle felt like a chore to get through but it picks up in comedy towards the end. It's a cringefest and even though I feel like I was the intended audience (albeit not Japanese), I enjoyed it thoroughly but couldn't bear cringing anymore. 6/10 high school.

That is good. But, it doesn\'t really take things anywhere. Less good.This show has its moments. Its protagonist is definitely a character. But, hmm... for most of the show, I was only barely entertained for some reason! All episodes ranged from ""mild like"" to ""neutral."" Which is odd, because... the main character is highly melodramatic (a good thing in my book). The show itself felt like it went nowhere, though; it\'s highly episodic. If the main character wasn\'t the way she was, this would have been immensely difficult to finish.I think that\'s my problem...with Watamote: I was felt neutral while watching it, with occasional enjoyment. It wasn\'t offensively bad nor very good, it just floated along, despite its harebrained main character. I laughed, but not often; I cringed, but not often (I\'m looking to cringe, in a show like this). There\'s also little character development, so if you weren\'t laughing or cringing, there\'s just not much chew on.But it\'s easy to become hyper-critical. There were reasons why I gave this show a 5 and not a 1. The intro and outro songs are quality. I enjoyed the creative artistic direction. The voice acting for the main character is excellent! (subbed, can\'t speak for dubbed) Fits the character perfectly, brings even more life to her, and its goofy delivery was responsible for most of my enjoyment. I chuckle just thinking about it sometimes. And while many of the comedic or potentially cringeworthy moments didn\'t get a laugh/cringe out of me for reasons I can\'t explain, there were a few here and there that did. I think the average viewer would find the show funnier and more cringeworthy than my experience.I have harsher tastes than the average viewer, so the odds are that you will like this show more than I did. While I enjoyed parts of it, I feel the MC deserved a better vehicle for character development than a mildly funny gag anime. I might give Watamote a rewatch down the road because I like its style, but I gotta say I\'m disappointed I didn\'t like it as much as I expected to. It\'s not all bad and has its perks, and thing is, you\'ll know if the show\'s for you after 4 or 5 episodes, so despite my criticisms, it may be worth a try. with Watamote: I was felt neutral while watching it, with occasional enjoyment.

Let’s just say…dating simulators aren’t the most accurate way to learn how to make friends!Be prepared to cringe, but also to laugh your heads off! To cope with her...extreme loneliness, Tomoko envisions that the happy friends around her are actually miserable, superficial and attention seeking. Though she says this, whenever an opportunity to talk to these 'unworthy' people comes up, her voice gets all frail, whimpery and quiet and she makes very awkward jerky motions with her body. If the anime left it at that, it may not be so cringe inducing, but the unique lifestyle of filling her spare time with playing dating simulators has made Tomoko very strange.She is desperate to have a romance like the ones in her video games, yet her social awkwardness has the opposite effect. She tends to sexualise random scenarios to set herself up for some very weird situations e.g. when a guy tried to swat away an ant from her arm, she freaked out and believed that it was due to her undeniable allure.There are only a few characters in Watamote, since the spotlight is on Tomoko. We have her best friend turned trendy and popular ‘Yuu chan’ whom Tomoko both despises, wants to be…and wants to be in a relationship with!? She feels some really weird attraction to either be like her and transform into a social butterfly and cling to the only friend she really has. Yuu is a bit dense though as she doesn’t really realise that Tomoko is still so socially awkward and exactly how dependent she is on their childhood friendship. The fact that she still continues to be Tomoko’s friend after she did some VERY strange and inappropriate things is heartwarming though!We also have ‘Ki chan,’ a little girl that idolises Tomoko based on the cool stories she tells her about her fake social prowess. The lengths that Tomoko goes to keep up the facade that she is popular and trendy are insane, especially when she tries to give herself hickeys with a vacuum cleaner. One of the absolute highlights of the show. We have a cute helpful umbrella guy who appears later in the story and gets entangled in one of Tomoko's awkward situations. I wished that he had actually become a closer friend of hers, but he only featured briefly.Tomoki, her brother doesn’t really pay attention to her and stays away from her so that her weird doesn’t rub off on him. The inability of Tomoko's mother to realise that her daughter was so lonely and that this was feeding her strange personality felt quite unrealistic. Though most of the reactions of Tomoko's class towards her weirdness felt pretty accurate, some of them seemed unrealistic also. Like they ignored her weirdness to an unbelievable degree! Imae is really the only one who shows up towards the end of the show who really shows any promise of actually becoming her friend. I was happy that they put some hopefulness amongst the social anxiety that is central to this show.Though there aren't many characters, Tomoko herself is such an entertaining protagonist, we don't really need them! From her weird fantasies where she envisions herself as some heroic desirable protagonist that everyone fawns over to her necessity to compensate for her lack of human interactions via interactions with cats, plushies and of course her hilarious dating games. Her fantasies and over exaggerations about the way that people are treating her are both hilarious and depressing at the same time.Watamote shows how your mind can either make your world appear like heaven or hell. Usually the things that seem like huge a social faux pas in reality are not that big of a deal. Our mind just tends to amplify the embarrassment. Tomoko’s mind did this very thing to a huge degree that lead her to acting really strangely in public and then grieving about her loneliness after the cringeworthy encounter was over. When you have an unusual personality, I don’t think Watamote is that far off in terms of the thoughts that run through your head and the crazy things you can do. Tomoko’s ability to make everyone else responsible for her being lonely and out of place is something that’s really easy to do and was captured really accurately in the show. Sometimes, when you can’t deal with your own weirdness, you must project your frustration onto others. This anime does a phenomenal job at showing the whole strange and unrelenting nature of social anxiety and the consequences of not fitting normal societal expectations. Though some may be disappointed by the lack of progress in the ending, I feel like it did service to what the show was trying to portray…resisting or changing your weirdness is much harder than embracing it and accepting that we are who we are. extreme loneliness, Tomoko envisions that the happy friends around her are actually miserable, superficial and attention seeking.

Socially awkward, shut-in, Otaku,only one friend (who lives in another country),not able to...relate with other girls or anyone in general, Uncharismatic, clumsy, unlucky and plain looking. I doubt anyone with a social life will be able to understand this anime. But one of the great things I love about this is how I can actually relate to Tomoko and have actually said and thought (and even done) most of the things seen in the series. This anime is also very refreshing because of the realism of a sort. (i can't give examples or I'll spoil it). I like to think of this as Himouto Umaru-Chan! but more realistic with a more relatable protagonist. If you aren't sure whether to start this anime or not, I suggest you just watch the first episode and are able to relate to Tomoko. if it gets stale, then don't watch the whole series and complain it was a waste of time. relate with other girls or anyone in general, Uncharismatic, clumsy, unlucky and plain looking.

In the anime, she attempted various ways to make herself more popular at her school. However, she failed all the time.Tomoko struggled to accept who she is.[Audience's self acceptance]...It's common to hear that anime fans experienced second hand embarrassment while watching Watamote. Some of them found it based; some found it cringe.People who found Watamote cringe struggled to accept their present/past-self.[Acceptance]Tomoko doesn't need to become popular. It is ok to be misfit, it is ok to be unpopular. What Tomoko truly needs is friends who accept her for who she is. One of the reasons why Tomoko kept failing in the anime was she tried too hard to become someone else. It's always best to just accept herself and be herself.[Reach out]After acceptance, the next step is to step out of comfort zone and reach out . Although Tomoko seems to be hopeless in the anime, various episodes imply that there is always people who care for her: she has a friend that she could hangout with; stranger who bought her an umbrella; senpai who looked out for her etc. I see all these as signs of hope for Tomoko.  An unnoticeable detail in the anime would be Tomoko's improvement in the anime. In the beginning of the anime, she struggled to greet her teacher due to her anxiety. In the end of the anime,she tried and said goodbye to her teacher. This was her first step to reach out to other people as her true self, Tomoko Kuroki. I believed she would keep on improving after this. (And indeed,Tomoko did improved a lot later in the manga and made some really good friends. No spoiler here but I recommend the manga if you would like to see Tomoko's character development.)Other than the strong message Watamote delivers, the show itself is very entertaining to watch.The comedy in the anime is great and I can't remember a single episode I didn't laugh at. There are many anime references used in the anime. As a K-ON fan, I was so excited when I saw the K-ON references. This anime is full of surprises.In terms of music, this show have great op, ed and inserts throughout the anime. It's amazing how they have 5 endings for a 12 episode anime. One of my favourite is Natsu Matsuri covered by Hatsune Miku.Character in Watamote is 10/10 since I just adore Tomoko that much! There are also fun support characters such as Yuu, Kiko and Tomoki. Unfortunately, we don't get to see the 2nd best girl (Yuri-chan) in the anime.To me, Tomoko is very relatable character. She reminds me of my past-self in secondary school. I was socially awkward and didn't have many friends. Unlike Tomoko, I didn't want to be popular. I never want to change who I am in order to fit in. I continued to be an introvert and immersed myself in the world of anime.This lasted until I went to uni and joined the anime society there. I found a group of friends who shared the same interests. We are comfortable within our own little community as we don't need to care about what the others think. Inevitably, I became an active and sociable person within the community. Even though I still struggle a bit socially outside the society, having group of great friends certainly helped me to develop. Weebs can be seen as weird and we certainly don't fit in well in a society full of normies. But we are all happy to be weird together.If you consider yourself as Tomoko right now, you should be yourself and reach out. It is always helpful to find friends with same interests.

I could very much relate to Tomoko and her struggles with social anxiety, acceptance, and popularity, this is what initially drew me into the series.I find the characters to be quite charming, Tomoko, Tomoki and Yu. All have stand out designs that match the characters’ personalities perfectly. I enjoy Tomoki and Tomoko’s realistic sibling relationship, it shows how you can be at each other's throats, but still care for each other. There are some really sweet family moments.The intro song is a banger, the outro song is pretty good. The...intro I feel shows in musical form Tomoko’s pent up emotion and frustration about not being able to connect and express herself due to her issues. It’s a really genius way to use an intro.I have heard some people have found the anime/series to be “cringey,” which yes, there are some moments that can be awkward. But I find that people who describe the show as cringe resemble Tomoko more than they would like to believe, and due to that they can’t watch it. Now that I have a better time with my own issues I can look at the situations Tomoko finds herself in, and my own past situations and laugh about the absurdity of them.It’s refreshing to see social anxiety to be portrayed in such an accurate way, albeit sometimes exaggerated for comedic effect. As most anime/manga have a girl/guy who is just shy around their crush, but fine around everyone else and has no trouble fitting in, they will slap the “social anxiety” label on them without even knowing what it is. As someone who has struggled my entire life with social anxiety, and who has been diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder it was very meaningful at that time in my life to see things that I had struggled with be presented in such a relatable and realistic way.I have only read a few volumes of the Watamote manga, but I plan to continue, as I hear Tomoko begins to grow as a person and come out of her shell more, so that’ll be exciting to see! intro I feel shows in musical form Tomoko’s pent up emotion and frustration about not being able to connect and express herself due to her issues.

I watched a Mumkey Jones Anime Review (which was joking and ironic) about the show, and it struck a chord with me. It seemed to be very ""real"" and had a unique premise. It\'s a story about an incredibly socially awkward girl beginning high school, trying to live the ideal High School life (particularly in the social, romantic and sexual departments). Tomoko Kuroki is her name, and she\'s my favourite anime character.She\'s adorable, in a creepy kind of way. I\'m not sure if people in real life can pull off this look, but large anime eyes can...help bring this aesthetic to success. She is quite short and has a small build too. She wears her uniform in a way none of the other girls too, it seems a little too traditional and perhaps out of touch (shocking for Tomoko to be out of touch of course, no way that would happen).I can relate to Tomoko to a degree, but the extremities it reaches in this show are way too much. It\'s cringe comedy that\'s difficult to watch at times. I\'m not exactly sure if it\'s comedy though. Sometimes it just seems like sad/cringe fuel. Tomoko\'s perverted nature is sick and twisted. Playing eroge games alone in her room has shifted her sexuality into a sad and pathetic direction. I mean at least it seems vanilla in terms of kinks lmao. There are some classic cringe moments that come from this part of her that I won\'t spoil.I\'m not sure if girls/women like Tomoko exist in real life. I wouldn\'t wish her hell onto anyone, particularly for women, who are usually more socially adjusted than their male counterparts. The gender swap perhaps makes the story more interesting, albeit less believable. But perhaps I\'m just not aware and women like her actually do exist.You may be wondering why I\'ve fixated only upon Tomoko so much, but that\'s because that\'s the character the show is all about. You don\'t really learn much about others. Her one friend has some depth and is chill, but that\'s about it. It\'s a very self focused world, a reflection of one of Tomoko\'s key issues - focusing too much on herself.Her problems are a few things. She has a very distorted view of reality, she is deathly afraid of social interaction, she resents and thinks down on others as a result of her lack of social success, yet desires their approval badly too. It\'s an extreme form of social anxiety I believe, alongside some unbridled lust. This whirlwind leads to cringe moments in the show obviously. I honestly expected to find it harder to watch than I did, I was always preparing for the worst and was able to handle it most of the time. But the uncomfortable moments, when they actually hit hard, are atrocious. You would assume I\'m more hardened against these cringe kind of moments given my resistance to the lighter ones, but honestly when watching shows with cringe (in the classic sense not the newer sense) I\'m usually the first to turn away from the screen.The opening song is badass, it works well. It\'s pretty iconic and people tend to say it\'s better than the show lol. I think the overall sound animation etc. is done very well. From the manga source material its exactly what you\'d want, it doesn\'t do anything wrong in these departments. It\'s well animated and has good sound is what I\'m trying to get at.A key focus critics/YouTubers will often focus on with this show is the lack of progress. Tomoko doesn\'t really make much in the way of progress the entire time. It\'s a little unsatisfying, and it would have been good to see later seasons explore that. Speaking of which, I recommend reading the manga after watching this. You\'ll breeze through the adapted chapters quickly and find yourself in a story of actual character development. I\'m all caught up on it and it\'s worth it emotionally to get to where Tomoko is now. It\'s a much happier place than before.I haven\'t touched much on plot points because I\'d rather not spoil them, but you know what to expect given how I\'ve written this, if you haven\'t seen the show already. I don\'t know why but I have a certain feeling of nostalgia towards this show. It\'s the good old Mumkey review I think, I used to enjoy that YouTube channel a lot. But despite the nostalgia Watamote still holds up. It isn\'t excellent or anything, but it\'s worth a watch in my opinion, even if it can be difficult at times It\'s a 7/10 for me. help bring this aesthetic to success. She is quite short and has a small build too. She wears her uniform in a way none of the other girls too, it seems a little too traditional and perhaps out of touch (shocking for Tomoko to be out of touch of course, no way that would happen).I can relate to Tomoko to a degree, but the extremities it reaches in this show are way too much. It\'s cringe comedy that\'s difficult to watch at times. I\'m not exactly sure if it\'s comedy though. Sometimes it just seems like sad/cringe fuel. Tomoko\'s perverted nature is sick and twisted. Playing eroge games alone in her room has shifted her sexuality into a sad and pathetic direction. I mean at least it seems vanilla in terms of kinks lmao. There are some classic cringe moments that come from this part of her that I won\'t spoil.I\'m not sure if girls/women like Tomoko exist in real life. I wouldn\'t wish her hell onto anyone, particularly for women, who are usually more socially adjusted than their male counterparts. The gender swap perhaps makes the story more interesting, albeit less believable. But perhaps I\'m just not aware and women like her actually do exist.You may be wondering why I\'ve fixated only upon Tomoko so much, but that\'s because that\'s the character the show is all about. You don\'t really learn much about others. Her one friend has some depth and is chill, but that\'s about it. It\'s a very self focused world, a reflection of one of Tomoko\'s key issues - focusing too much on herself.Her problems are a few things. She has a very distorted view of reality, she is deathly afraid of social interaction, she resents and thinks down on others as a result of her lack of social success, yet desires their approval badly too. It\'s an extreme form of social anxiety I believe, alongside some unbridled lust. This whirlwind leads to cringe moments in the show obviously. I honestly expected to find it harder to watch than I did, I was always preparing for the worst and was able to handle it most of the time. But the uncomfortable moments, when they actually hit hard, are atrocious. You would assume I\'m more hardened against these cringe kind of moments given my resistance to the lighter ones, but honestly when watching shows with cringe (in the classic sense not the newer sense) I\'m usually the first to turn away from the screen.The opening song is badass, it works well. It\'s pretty iconic and people tend to say it\'s better than the show lol. I think the overall sound animation etc. is done very well. From the manga source material its exactly what you\'d want, it doesn\'t do anything wrong in these departments. It\'s well animated and has good sound is what I\'m trying to get at.A key focus critics/YouTubers will often focus on with this show is the lack of progress. Tomoko doesn\'t really make much in the way of progress the entire time. It\'s a little unsatisfying, and it would have been good to see later seasons explore that. Speaking of which, I recommend reading the manga after watching this. You\'ll breeze through the adapted chapters quickly and find yourself in a story of actual character development. I\'m all caught up on it and it\'s worth it emotionally to get to where Tomoko is now. It\'s a much happier place than before.I haven\'t touched much on plot points because I\'d rather not spoil them, but you know what to expect given how I\'ve written this, if you haven\'t seen the show already. I don\'t know why but I have a certain feeling of nostalgia towards this show. It\'s the good old Mumkey review I think, I used to enjoy that YouTube channel a lot. But despite the nostalgia Watamote still holds up. It isn\'t excellent or anything, but it\'s worth a watch in my opinion, even if it can be difficult at times It\'s a 7/10 for me.', 'While the pacing can be slow at times The show does a great adaptation of the manga and the great choice of Kitta, Izu as well as Rial, Monica both give Tomoko a fitting voice The anime has a great art  design and amazing opening that just screams what the anime is about. The enjoyment I got from the story Is watching Tomoko and her unique way of dealing with seemingly normal events that she completely fucks one way or the other.While watching this anime I felt myself relating to the main character because if I was a woman I would definitely be like...her because of that every time Tomoko does something stupid It hurts me because I probably have done something equally or worst, Like the time she struggled to say goodbye to the teacher in the School gate or reading porn and getting caught by her mom..The only way I can describe it is like looking in a mirror except in the reflection I had tits (small ones at that). her because of that every time Tomoko does something stupid It hurts me because I probably have done something equally or worst, Like the time she struggled to say goodbye to the teacher in the School gate or reading porn and getting caught by her mom..The only way I can describe it is like looking in a mirror except in the reflection I had tits (small ones at that).', 'I passed this one because I saw a lot of negative reviews about it.

I\'ve seen a lot of people calling this boring, or even a 11 episode filler. But it\'s not like that, yes it gets a bit boring at certain moments but generally it is very relatable and that makes it watchable in my case. If you experienced what Tomoko...experienced, you\'ll immediately laugh, feel bad for her, and then start crying because unlike hers, your experiences are not fictional.Yes, Tomoko is lazy, weak and ""retarded"". This might come as a surprise but some people are actually born or grew up like that, It might feel easy for someone who didn\'t have any problems socializing to overcome the obstacles Tomoko has in her way but, as someone who has gone through what she has, I can say that it\'s not that simple.The show basically explains its plot in the very beginning quite simply and truthfully, ""A totally trivial story"" experienced, you\'ll immediately laugh, feel bad for her, and then start crying because unlike hers, your experiences are not fictional.Yes, Tomoko is lazy, weak and ""retarded"".

She is just too damned adorable.In many ways she was like me back then, though not everything. She is a lot more determined to my feeling fine being in the corner, for one thing.Funny enough, she might ware the pants in the relationship, until she has one of her internal feakout moments.This show gets the ""Life is both Tragic and Hilarious"" down to a T. For instance, her losing her marbles over her missing umbrella was nothingbut gold, because I\'ve been there.I have a feeling I am repeating the samething other reviewers have said. Which is obvious. Tomoko is us, for all the good and bad that entails.So yeah, on my favorites list, definatly going to rewatch it, get the BluRay/4k, and the Manga.Season Two will be a long time coming.

What Watamote brings to the table that no other work I've seen has is that it portrays the lifestyle of a loser, NEET, hikkikomori, or however else you'd phrase it, in a light that is both stark and realistic and also sympathetic and comedic. From what I can tell, most of the criticism the show receives is from folks for whom the character's struggles hit too close to home. Watamote doesn't have the tone though of a show that picks...on the viewer; rather, it shows us the insider prospective of someone awkward and immature in both a way we can analyze and laugh at.The show is brilliant in that it is what I'd call an 'un-moé.' Tomoko, being less than confident in her own merits, frequently uses the kinds of 'get-popular-quick' schemes that, in moé animes, would work. She'll try adopting a persona of an 'anime hungry girl,' trying and failing to drink coffee in a trendy manner, or seducing her brother to predictably disastrous effects. When we are privy to Tomoko being a pervert, it is not presented with the kind of acceptance we'd see in an ecchi, instead either leaning into how bizarre it makes Tomoko. The interplay of the character with the show's refreshing, albeit perhaps gimmicky, tentpole makes for laughter and oof's in abundance.The show isn't bursting with production value, however the artistic decisions are novel and amusing, with moody filters, use of kinetic typography and graphics, and even cubist renderings of Tomoko. Music and sound design are similarly on the quirky side, which really helps in establishing the mood, whether it be the naïve optimism of one of Tomoko's plans being lain or the wasteland of cringe when the ugly duckling finally hatches.At least in the realm of comedy, nothing has come close to Watamote for me in terms of enjoyment. That's perhaps what makes its lack of a second season such a bitter pill; it seems anime fans, many of whom could probably benefit from the kind of cultural and personal introspection Watamote can offer them, had their fill with one season. It's a cruel irony that Watamote, which offered a chance for moé slobs to take a look at themselves and what they're doing with their lives, have ditched it by the wayside in favor of the newest season's oppai lolis and brutish male characters lifting skirts at will to no discernable consternation. Further, while the show and manga series are not 100% congruent, I highly urge anyone who likes the one to try the other. This is practically mandatory viewing in my opinion to anyone who either suffers from the kind of personal anxiety Tomoko does or anyone mired in the muck of moé shows. on the viewer; rather, it shows us the insider prospective of someone awkward and immature in both a way we can analyze and laugh at.The show is brilliant in that it is what I'd call an 'un-moé.'

This was the anime that got me back into the whole world of it after a years-long hiatus. The story here is that after disconnecting from the medium some time in middle school for some ridiculous social reasons, I stumbled upon a clip from Watamote while I was scrolling aimlessly on my phone. I thought it was pretty funny, so I found an anime site and just started watching. I was pulled in, and before I knew it I had watched the whole thing, sun rising outside, and I thought to myself ""Ok, so I love anime. I\'m never going...back."" which kicked off the extent and intensity of my current passion for anime. In a way, Watamote itself motivated me to return, since so many of Tomoko\'s problems come from the fact she\'s so worried about being liked, about what other people think about her. Watamote is hard to watch for some people, and life-changing for others, because it holds a mirror up to your insecurities. The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung talked about coming to terms with and ultimately incorporating all the aspects of our personality into a cohesive whole in order to become a full person, even those parts we\'d rather ignore, and I believe Watamote reminds the viewer of just what exactly that is for each of us. The story is a very simple, slice-of-life setup. It talks about an awkward girl with few friends and no romantic experience who is desperate to break out of her shell while also being terrified of what lies beyond it. This results in her constantly failing simple social interactions in a spectacular fashion, resulting in a fair dose of sympathy, comedy, and secondhand cringe. The art and sound are very on-par with what one should expect from an anime, no more no less, though I will say it is very reminiscent of the 2010s in a warm and nostalgic kind of way. Tomoko\'s design is a stroke of genius, perfectly embodying her personality and conveying emotions and body language flawlessly, to the point that reaction images and profile pictures from the anime abound to this day. It is her character that really gives this show its power, and that\'s because she is the most relatable character I have yet come across in an anime. That isn\'t to say that I think i\'m completely like her, but rather that all her insecurities, all her shortcomings, all her fears and worries, are familiar in some way, and I completely understand her position because they are a part of everybody to some extent. That makes something special and beautiful out of this anime. Not a single one of us will fail to recognize at least one of her many anxieties, and as a result we all want to protect her, to guide her and tell her it\'s going to be OK, because we\'re telling ourselves through her. She\'s a spectacular character. I definitely recommend this anime, especially if you\'re feeling down about yourself, anxious about society or unsure of the future. Overall a fun, cute, sometimes hard to watch slice-of-life anime that captures the spirit of how a slice-of-life is supposed to interact with its audience, and an anime which is colossally important to me personally. back."" which kicked off the extent and intensity of my current passion for anime.

She's to scared to find a boyfriend, so instead she makes up lies and tells her friends and family about a guy she met in the rain one day. She also wanted a job at a romantic bakery, but instead she got one at a cake factory. She just always seems to screw up. I...know that's kind of the point and that it's a comedy.

He\'s a normal high school student, average amount of friends, average looks, and average amount of girls who like him. He has the same bags underneath his eyes as Tomoko has and they seem pretty close to talk back to each other all the time. The feuds between them are pretty funny at times. He gets my stamp of approval for being so goddamn normal.Yu Narase--- An old best friend of Tomoko. It seems she was very quiet and reserved when she was in middle school and they split for high school. They meet to hang out one day and shes become very kawaii^^. I really enjoyed this character because I loved how she clashed with Tomoko\'s character. Yu is cute, out going, and everything that Tomoko wants to be.There probably was more development in the series but I did watch from episode 1 to 6. From what I saw, it wasn\'t going anywhere.

If you want to pass time, go on ahead but if your looking for an anime to cherish... This Watamote isn\'t your anime. Overall I give it a solid 6.5, for being funny, dark, boring, and entertaining... All at the same goddamn time.-ChunsaChan', ""Social anxiety and awkwardness are something we can all pretty much relate to. Don’t lie. You know you’ve had your fair share of embarrassing moments, but, here, Tomoko takes social awkwardness to a whole different level – forcing us to relive those tragic, bleak moments of our lives, while allowing us to laugh at ourselves too.Watamote, short for “Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!,” which roughly translates to 'No Matter How I Look at It, It’s You Guys Fault I’m Not Popular,' is a rather self-explained title about a teenage girl just getting into high school, with deep social anxiety...issues, and her delusional expectations of what a high school life should be like.Obviously, the extremity of her awkwardness was mainly input for the sake of comedy and jokes. It’s hard to say whether there are people like Tomoko because, unlike most people, Tomoko seems to lack the ability to read, or gauge, the feeling or mood of a social situation. Maybe her ignorance is due to her long-time isolation. Maybe instead of spending all that time watching anime and playing video games, she should have spent it on extra-curricular activities. Or MAYBE, she’s just fine the way she is.I don’t know about you guys, but I always thought high school kids were pretty weird to begin with. Or, it’s not that they’re weird, they just don’t have a firm grasp of who they are yet (plus, we are more easily influenced at that age). It’s just a part of growing up. We can either embrace our loneliness and awkwardness, or we can work to be a part of other people’s lives. It all depends on the person and how they see it, I guess. However, the story doesn’t go out of its way to romanticize the idea that it gets better for Tomoko. If anything, her situation gets worse. But that’s what makes it funny . . . and also very dull. It works for Watamote if you can accept that dark reality, but repetition gets boring. In my opinion, the comedy relieves its shortcomings a bit. Some jokes were gold, others didn’t fully nail them, yet, her inner struggles were so sad I couldn’t help but giggle, though I was mainly laughing at myself.Also, her relationship with her family was probably my favorite aspect of the show and a subject that I would like to touch upon. A lot of viewers seemed to have a problem with Tomoko’s parents’ “ignorance” and “insensitivity” towards her social anxiety. I, on the other hand, found it pretty hilarious. Because if they’re anything like my parents, they would have just brushed her off as crazy and made her do chores (which they do at some point) – the answer to everything, apparently. And, in a way, it’s true how small accomplishments can go a long way to change our moods and minor depressions, similar to the way that exercise releases endorphins, which causes us to feel good, or happy. Unfortunately, being an otaku gets along with physical inactivity. However, I wouldn’t take it personally if family members were to ever show that sort of “carelessness.” It just means they have a different view on what they consider problematic and significant. When you think about it, social awkwardness is actually very insignificant compared to larger world problems and something that can be easily cured with constant human interaction. Plus, Tomoko is still a freshman. Her journey of self-discovery has only just begun, and it’s a journey no one can take for her. Although, I doubt the author plans to stray away from the line of dark comedy anytime soon.To sum up, Watamote is a “dark” comedy about a teenage girl, with very poor social skills, who is still struggling to find herself. The concept is really good, and I would recommend this series to anyone, though, I personally wasn’t overly enthusiastic to watch it every week. issues, and her delusional expectations of what a high school life should be like.Obviously, the extremity of her awkwardness was mainly input for the sake of comedy and jokes.

Kuroki is your average teenaged girl, but she has a lot of social anxiety, and no matter how much she works at trying to find friends or fulfill her perverted dreams, she tends to fall short of her goals.As someone who suffers from social anxiety, this whole anime is like second-hand embarrassment to me. I had to cover my face with my blanket or turn away and close my eyes from certain situations, just because I either had a similar experience or I know what Kuroki's going through....Not a binge-able show.It is really funny and has some heartfelt moments, but at the end of the day, it's a comedy about trying to find friends.

Her vast experience in fantasizing situations up have a tendency to give Tomoko surreal expectations of how real life works and her disappointment is depressing to watch. You have to keep remembering that at least she has a decent family and at least one friend, Yuu-san, who really deserves all merits for putting up with Tomoko. I'm really glad that she does....Tomoko wants to be popular, but as the show progresses, she just want her existence to be acknowledged. Her best shot at that is obliterating a cockroach during class, causing an adverse impression on her classmates.

Can't argue with that. The writers get the small details. Although I'd say it still could be better. When we're talking about social anxiety there's a lot of things that can be poked fun at, which brings me to the next point...For a comedy/slice of life watamote is good enough, I did get enjoyment from the humor... at the first half. Then it gradually becomes more repetitive and annoying. And that's not...to say episodic format sucks, I enjoy nichijou even though it's just the same pointless slice of life comedy. There are LOTS of potential in watamote, but yet the more I watch it the more I get disappointed. The story sometimes tricks you to think there's a plot when there isn't, and there's nothing wrong with that if just the writers can fully utilize the humor potential of the premise. Which watamote just... doesn't. Instead it opts for repetitive jokes and cringy moments. I mean come on, you can get to youtube and find a lot of short animations by amateur animators poking fun at social anxiety and they still feel rich in content compared to whatever this is.The characters. Oh dear lord the characters. Let's forget everyone else for now since no one (besides the mc) in this series seems to matter that much. Let's talk about the star of the series itself, Kuroki Tomoko. As I said earlier, she's a very relatable character if you have social anxiety but holy crap is she delusional af. At the first half she's funny and relatable, as you get to the second half of the series she becomes insufferable. For someone who desperately wants to become popular she sure doesn't learn at all from her experiences. Character development is nonexistent in this series so yeah, don't expect that.Tomoko actually has access to someone who can help her (Yuu) but instead she's just there to, what exactly? Absolutely nothing but to portray the difference between her and the mc, in other words, absolutely useless. Imae-san... the one character that has the potential to drive an actual development, but she was at the very end of the series and cut short before we know anything about the relationship dynamic between tomoko and her. I'm particularly interested in Imae because she reminds me of my friend back in college, she would talk with anyone, even the weird ones, and she indirectly helped me improve my social skills and made me become more confident. Shame they decide to end it there.The art and sound I think are the only ones that redeem this series. I really like the animations and the portrayal of the characters' expressions and feelings. The sound is solid too, the effects help make the humor in this series by a lot.

You laugh at it in the same way you laugh at a video of a toddler riding down the stairs with a tricycle and falling off; laughter at the action, ridicule at the one doing it, realization that it\'s a bit sad, and then sympathy.We look inside the life of Tomoko, a NEET/hikikomori high school girl who spends her time playing video games and watching anime instead of doing whatever normal...anime high schoolers do. She can barely speak to anyone, and is constantly ridiculed by everyone in her life. Her awkwardness and social anxiety land her in many awkward situations, ones which, like the example given in the last paragraph, are more wincing than laughter.It\'s painful to watch at some points, in fact even most points, but I believe that this kind of comedy is one that only works at its full effect when you relate to the main character. Not exactly proud, but I related. When I was younger I was pretty bad at socializing too, and did things that were pretty stupid. It was refreshing seeing that I wasn\'t alone, and that I had the opportunity to laugh at myself (In case you\'re wondering I\'m a lot better now).Even if you don\'t share my experiences (you\'re looking at reviews of an anime from 2013 that is something only people who call themselves weebs would watch, so you most likely do), Tomoko is one of my favorite characters ever. You can root for her. She is a loser. idiot, reject, and overall a very sad protoplasmic mass of an anime schoolgirl. But you just can\'t help but want to see her win. You feel sorry for her, but it doesn\'t feel forced. The situations presented all feel very natural, and so do Tomoko\'s awkward responses. It\'s legitimately heartbreaking to see how others treat her, and how she treats herself over it. Despite her lack of results, you know that she\'s trying her hardest.The biggest critique most have is the lack of change within the show, Tomoko is essentially the exact same at the start and at the end. Each episode doesn\'t feel very different from each other, and it blends together. It is a bit upsetting to never see Tomoko grow, but social anxiety is hard to beat. You don\'t just get over it instantly or ""stop being awkward"". It takes years sometimes, and some people never do ""stop being awkward"". It\'s the greatest triumph of this show, and one which is far better than most portrayals of severe social anxiety in most other shows. The repetition creates sort of a mental fog that I feel would perfectly represent how Tomoko feels about her life and how boring she thinks it is.

As for Tomoko not developing, she supposedly does in the manga, but I\'ll get around to reading that later.Overall: Episodic and bland story, but still passable, unchanging but well-done main character, excellent presentation of themes, painful but effective humor, production is okay despite the show\'s non-existent budget, absolute classic ending theme.Either you love it or hate it, and no matter what people say, I love it.

If you never struggled with social skills and making friendships you will not like this anime.

One of the most mean spirited things I\'ve ever seen at points, actively seeking out to torture the viewer through second hand embarrassment. This, however, does not stop Watamote from being such an absolute delight of a show. Willing to bully a character so ruthlessly and harshly that it teeters on cartoonish. However, the show actually does manage to take more serious moments with a level of maturity that is unexpected from a series that also shows a dad walking in on a teenage girl with a vibrator near her crotch as she plays visual novels with shirtless men.While some absolute...mouth breathers on MyAnimeList believe this to be too mean and unjustified, I find this to be laughable, and very telling of the person writing their review. Tomoko is not a wholly awful person, she has moments of sympathy, dashes of relatability and even points in which empathy is the strongest tie you have to the character. However, every time she gets punished, she is not relaying her sheer depression, or trying to improve her core character in any way. She is acting like a narcissistic smug piece of shit who thinks she\'s so much better than any person around her, constantly calls people ret*rded fatties, and believes she is OWED or entitled to any form of attention from anyone around her despite giving none out. She is the definition of a bad person, despite the fact that, especially in the later episodes, you do feel genuinely sorry for her at points. However in those moments, she is not displaying any of her terrible selfish behavior. It\'s more so when she thinks that the ""fatty"" is in love with her because he could never get any girl, and she is just gracing him with her presence, or when she refuses to shower and covers herself with ants. That is the behavior that gets punished, not her lamenting.Anyone who claims to have Tomoko as their literally me character is very much a self report, in the same way of people who unironically think that Billy from Buffalo 66 is literally them, or Travis Bickle. Oh, you\'re just like Tomoko? So you\'re a terrible human being that I\'d never want to be around in any way? Thanks for the heads up. It\'s these people who cannot fathom their own social anxiety, delusions of grandeur, or refusal of any form of giving out attention or affection to be the cause of their problems that are the reason this show is rated so lowly. The femcels being made fun of cannot take the joke against them, and cannot take the ribbing against them either. They are so deluded, almost like Tomoko, go figure. mouth breathers on MyAnimeList believe this to be too mean and unjustified, I find this to be laughable, and very telling of the person writing their review. Tomoko is not a wholly awful person, she has moments of sympathy, dashes of relatability and even points in which empathy is the strongest tie you have to the character. However, every time she gets punished, she is not relaying her sheer depression, or trying to improve her core character in any way. She is acting like a narcissistic smug piece of shit who thinks she\'s so much better than any person around her, constantly calls people ret*rded fatties, and believes she is OWED or entitled to any form of attention from anyone around her despite giving none out. She is the definition of a bad person, despite the fact that, especially in the later episodes, you do feel genuinely sorry for her at points. However in those moments, she is not displaying any of her terrible selfish behavior. It\'s more so when she thinks that the ""fatty"" is in love with her because he could never get any girl, and she is just gracing him with her presence, or when she refuses to shower and covers herself with ants. That is the behavior that gets punished, not her lamenting.Anyone who claims to have Tomoko as their literally me character is very much a self report, in the same way of people who unironically think that Billy from Buffalo 66 is literally them, or Travis Bickle.

Like a punch of reality on the stomach for you to see how its really you life (if...you are relatable) and make you learn what you need to change to get better things! you are relatable) and make you learn what you need to change to get better things!', 'It\'s complicated to review this anime, the first episodes set the story straight, its about this unpopular girl with social anxiety that wants to be popular and fails at it in funny ways. It makes us believe that we will see tomoko developing as a character, that she\'ll learn from her mistakes and eventually be popular, or at least that she\'ll get one or two friends, but that never happens. Not once in the 12 episodes. We watch this girl fail again and again to a point where it feels sad to watch, in the last chapters i was just watching because i still had...a bit of hope that she would gain a friend but that never happened. It feels cruel and its painful to watch...But on the other hand...The first chapters are great, they very accurately represent the mindset of a ""femcel"" and the concept is quite interesting! i believe it could be a great anime if Tomoko got some character development at the end of the series, or if the girl in the bear suit and her became friends.As for the humour, its a mixed bag. Most of it comes from the stupidly embarassing situations Tomoko causes, so depending on the person you can die laughing or cringe the entire series, personally even if i related to tomoko i still cringed most of the time, i stopped watching for a while because the humour became quite stale and it honestly made me depressed to watch this high school girl be tortured every episode, the show is very mean-spirited for some reason.I would recommend watching the first episodes because they show an interesting character that i haven\'t seen in many other animes, Tomoko is for the most part a realistic depiction of how a mentally ill and socially awkward girl sees and interacts with the world and that\'s the most interesting part of the series, the thing that kept me watching personally, for the rest its all just awkward and repetitive stuff that i would rather ignore. a bit of hope that she would gain a friend but that never happened.

I understand you..."". I\'m not going to lie that there were some very painful moments watching this anime,...I\'m sure almost everyone here has felt excluded at school, I wanted Tomoko to have a happy ending, I don\'t know, it would have been cool if she had at least managed to have at least one friend at school, or for her brother Tomoki to stop being a complete asshole!This is another interesting point too, your brother is an idiot who has no empathy for his own sister, look, I\'ll tell you, I felt so bad about that scene where Tomoko was crying at dawn because she felt bad about not having any friend and not enjoying her vacation at all and instead of her brother helping her with a few words or something, he just treated it as a ""tantrum"" from his sister and told her to shut up, how angry!But I don\'t hate Watamote because it has idiotic characters, in fact, that\'s what makes this anime good, the situations were really very surgical...Well, talking about good things now! I love the scenes where Tomoko is just being an otaku gamer without worrying about anything, if she lived in today\'s times, she would definitely have a lot of friends! Seeing her playing Dating Sim reminded me of the times when I played too, so good!The opening isn\'t my favorite, but the ending, ahh, I love the way she says ""Aho ga!"".A detail that I found very interesting about this anime is also how Tomoko is almost a bisexual icon, she is clearly attracted to her friend, I\'m not going to lie that I was rooting for Tomoko in her plans of wanting to be with her friend hahahaWell, I have nothing more to say, this anime is interesting, funny and sad at the same time, nostalgic and VERY IDENTIFIABLE, watch it and be happy! 💫....[Pt-Br]Watamote é um anime que me deixa bem nostálgica, me lembra a época da escola, tanto pq esse anime era bem famoso naquela época, quanto porque eu imagino que eu e todos que assistiram se identificaram nem que seja um pouco com a Tomoko.Mas algo é interessante nesse anime, ao mesmo tempo que ele é engraçado, é meio mórbido também pois a forma que ele representa a realidade chega a ser real demais, fazendo a gente até parar de rir no momento e pensar: ""Poxa, que dó da Tomoko, eu te entendo..."". Não vou mentir que teve momentos bem dolorosos em assistir esse anime, certeza que quase todos aqui já sentiram na pele ser excluído na escola, queria que Tomoko tivesse um final feliz, não sei, seria legal se ela ao menos tivesse conseguido ter pelo menos uma amiga na escola, ou que seu irmão Tomoki parasse de ser um babaca completo! Esse é outro ponto interessante também, seu irmão é um idiota que não tem empatia por sua própria irmã, olha, eu vou falar pra vocês, eu me senti tão mal com aquela cena onde Tomoko estava chorando de madrugada por estar mal de não ter nenhum amigo e não estar aproveitando nada de suas férias e ao invés de seu irmão ir ajudá-la com algumas palavras ou algo do tipo, ele só tratou aquilo como uma ""birra"" de sua irmã e mandou ela se calar, que raiva!Mas não odeio Watamote por ter personagens babacas, na verdade, isso é o que faz esse anime bom, as situações foram realmente muito cirúrgicas...Bem, falando de coisas boas agora!

So when the anime in question presents to us a very socially inept girl who clearly suffers from high levels of stress in her everyday life (hence the L core eyebags) with a family that as of now can't tell what her real problem is, I ask myself: Is this supposed to be funny?Realistically, the show is delivered as a comedy but with the sheer amount of...second hand embarrassment and humiliation that we was an audience go through with each social failure that Tomoko has to suffer as well it becomes much clearer that there might be more than is given credit towards.Social anxiety is a terrible thing, and unlike the popular Komi-san, a character with a similar communication disorder, Tomoko has no one to support her. She is limited to her own delusions; what she thinks is wrong with her, why she thinks no one talks to her, and as a safety blanket the easiest thing for her to do is blame others. This in no way shape or form is healthy for her and its obvious in the way that even muttering one word to a male figure is a huge win for her in her mind. Eventually you stop laughing and can't help but pity the poor girl.I think this is a possibility to explore this character more, and discover how exactly she could grow out of this or like Hachi from SNAFU finally open up to someone and ask for help, but where the anime fell flat was in its lack of any other characters to care about and poor set-up for any following season. While I think that Tomoko has an interesting character to add depth to, the anime simply failed to do so, leaving her a shut in incel for all 12 ep, almost as if they knew there would be no second season.In conclusion, while I enjoyed the show and the character, there was too little to really be more invested in, leaving me to read the manga instead to hopefully see the larger character development that the anime as lacking. second hand embarrassment and humiliation that we was an audience go through with each social failure that Tomoko has to suffer as well it becomes much clearer that there might be more than is given credit towards.Social anxiety is a terrible thing, and unlike the popular Komi-san, a character with a similar communication disorder, Tomoko has no one to support her.

The show focuses on Tomoko Kuroki, a freshman in high-school who suffers from a bad case of social anxiety. The show's story revolves around this aspect of her, her social anxiety putting her in embarrassing situations and Tomoko's thoughts on the matter afterwards.I really do like the concept on-paper, but executed as a show leaves some things to be desired. My main complaint is that it's all just very repetitive, even more so than your standard slice-of-life show. Each episode can be accurately described as a process...of watching Tomoko go to school, embarrass herself, and run home and cry about it afterwards. While it's mainly comedic in it's execution of these, the show does at least put some focus on just how Tomoko's crippling social anxiety affects her mentally in a semi-serious way. Personally, I would have preferred if the show focused more on the serious nature but I can't really complain about the comedic focus, some laughs are to be had.The show's art and soundtrack are different than what you normally see in slice-of-life. I dig the geometric lighting style and you don't see many slice-of-life shows that feature some actually killer guitar riffs.The show's character-cast is almost entirely composed of Tomoko for most of the show. She's a loner after all, so there aren't many times where she's interacting with background characters. Of the few supporting characters, Yuu-chan was cool and I liked the dynamic between her and Tomoko.Overall, my perception of the show is pretty average. I think the show really suffers from being too repetitive, and I feel like they could have backed up from making everything so care-free and comedic at times to focus on what Tomoko must be feeling emotionally. I think that would have really helped out the show. It's not bad overall, just repetitive in my opinion. 6/10 from me. of watching Tomoko go to school, embarrass herself, and run home and cry about it afterwards.

Its similar to anime such as Blend S or K-on because Watamote is meant to be a light hearted slice of life. Sometimes it hits the goal of being a light heated slice of life and other times its just painful to watch. The protagonist of this show is a 15 year old girl called Tomoko, a total introvert who can't even speak to people in the real world. And she wants to become hot and popular. This is the general plot/driving force of this show. And just as expected, she fails everytime. This...can sometimes be quite funny or really fucking painful and annoying. I did say earlier in this review that this is a light hearted comedy similar to anime such as Blend S or K-on and they succeed in there goals and so they don't have much charecter devoplment if none at all becuse its not needed. However with an anime like Watamote I did expect some character development because the plot. There is no charecter devoplement what so ever in Watamote, infact I would go so far to say the only that changes in the time. The Most charecter development tomoko has is in episode 2 after she makes a kinda says a word at the teacher before going home. which caused a magic rainbow of happiness moment. Watamote also tries to show some deep themes at times. They often work, other times they don't. The Show tries be to a light hearted comedy and a deep wholesome overcomming show at the same time and it just doesn't work at all.Dispite all this Tomoko is one of the most relatable protagonists out there for the average anime fan and this often makes the show funnier. The opening is also pretty cool. In summary if you want a realtable show about an intovert failing at life, then you will enjoy it.

The main character is unique which allows the series to stand out but at the same time the setting is similar to plenty of other anime so there is definitely a sense of familiarity to the series.

The truth is I liked seeing a character like her fumble around and mess up because to a certain extend I related to her and it was like poking fun at myself and at the same time laughing at other's mistakes is simply fun for a bit, but past a certain extent there is a large sense of guilt that seeped up to me in which I could no longer find myself to enjoy the series as it was almost akin to laughing at a caged up tormented animal and it almost seemed sadistic of me to try to find ways to continue watching and trying to find enjoyment out of this series. take away from the likability of the character and it becomes somewhat painful to endure.

Tomoko Kuroki is entangled in her own thoughts and chained by her lack of social skills. Most of her endeavours could literally be described as romanticizing your melancholic solitude. Time and time again without progressing, she tries to fit in by applying patterns she learned from watching anime or playing otome-games.While it is frustrating to watch Tomoko being embarrassed and failing to socialize, I like about her character that she still lingers onto her youthful hope, that people will like her without her needing to act or change. Without being forced, Tomoko will...rely on escaping into the anonymity of the internet and on substituting simulations and fake scenarios for real affection, love and attention of her peers. She only so manages her pathetic life because her parents care for her, and fulfil her basic needs. Other than that Tomoko stagnates and only wanders astray, days passing by.Her entire character is of ambivalent nature and portrays the uncertainty of life as a misfit. In one instant she wants to be like everyone else, in the following, she condemns them for their “immodest” practices or deems those a waste of time. She finds comfort in looking down on others, while at the same time wanting to be like them. What will dominate her feelings? The peaceful bliss of being alone or the existential dread of being lonely?The depressing atmosphere of this anime, evoked by the pitiable attempts of Tomoko to somehow ameliorate her social life without stepping out of her comfort zone renders this anime so real, and more or less relatable. This is furthermore emphasized by the many satirically employed references to more idealistic anime for example. 6/10ART: Watamote has decent artwork, and I haven’t noticed any flaws. I have always liked studio Silver Link’s playful and vivid approach to animation, as this really adds much to feeling what the characters experience. E.g., Tomoko being drawn gray, while everyone is drawn colorful in school symbolizing her being excluded while everyone is amusing themselves. Another thing I noticed is that the studio uses different art styles to fit different situations, and to support the storytelling. 8/10MUSIC: The ending with its “yami kawaii” sound slaps. The lyrics are an internal cry for help masked by the catchy upbeat music. The opening and OST are forgettable, although I liked how the soundtrack made situations in which Tomoko couldn’t read social cues more awkward. 7/10ENJOYMENT: Is everyone else stupid, or am I just retarded? I may have related to Tomoko more in the past, as I now have matured and have become more self-conscious, but just like her back then I couldn’t understand why people would have fun in activities I thought of as mundane. Like playing ball games during recreation. Or spending time with each other after school. Nonetheless, I wanted to attain that bond the others in school had: Friendship. This was during my elementary years; I had a hard time finding friends and I fled to my very own means of escapism. I would have hoped that Tomoko somehow comes to terms with the concept of the individuality of the group and each of its members, and tried harder to overcome her social anxiety, reflecting upon the root of her struggles: her negative expectation. As much as I like the slice of life genre, the lack of a take-away message, real development, and some comedic elements consisting of Tomoko being mocked in vulnerable moments are cruel.  5,5/10 rely on escaping into the anonymity of the internet and on substituting simulations and fake scenarios for real affection, love and attention of her peers. She only so manages her pathetic life because her parents care for her, and fulfil her basic needs. Other than that Tomoko stagnates and only wanders astray, days passing by.Her entire character is of ambivalent nature and portrays the uncertainty of life as a misfit. In one instant she wants to be like everyone else, in the following, she condemns them for their “immodest” practices or deems those a waste of time. She finds comfort in looking down on others, while at the same time wanting to be like them. What will dominate her feelings? The peaceful bliss of being alone or the existential dread of being lonely?The depressing atmosphere of this anime, evoked by the pitiable attempts of Tomoko to somehow ameliorate her social life without stepping out of her comfort zone renders this anime so real, and more or less relatable. This is furthermore emphasized by the many satirically employed references to more idealistic anime for example. 6/10ART: Watamote has decent artwork, and I haven’t noticed any flaws. I have always liked studio Silver Link’s playful and vivid approach to animation, as this really adds much to feeling what the characters experience. E.g., Tomoko being drawn gray, while everyone is drawn colorful in school symbolizing her being excluded while everyone is amusing themselves. Another thing I noticed is that the studio uses different art styles to fit different situations, and to support the storytelling. 8/10MUSIC: The ending with its “yami kawaii” sound slaps. The lyrics are an internal cry for help masked by the catchy upbeat music. The opening and OST are forgettable, although I liked how the soundtrack made situations in which Tomoko couldn’t read social cues more awkward. 7/10ENJOYMENT: Is everyone else stupid, or am I just retarded?

No one seems to notice her, except her one friend, who hardly shows...up, because she goes to a different school.Tomoko has no idea how to be social and when she tries, she seems terrified, but she does try. Like many of us, she wants to be accepted and noticed. But she has no idea how to do that, and no one is helping her. She tries to find answers online but usually gets either no answer, or weird ones.She struggles to find ways to be accepted/noticed and usually gets it wrong. And when she is not noticed, sometimes she has rather violent thoughts. Sometimes she lives in her head daydreaming about how she would like things to go, and then comes back to reality.There is little hope for her, and many times she just resigns herself to the situation, only to come back later and try again to speak to someone.Minor spoilers here: Near the end there is one episode that has some overt lesbianism, which was unnecessary and out of place (what were those writers thinking?!) And also near the end there is one person who reaches out to her.Watching this was painful and I don't know how I made it through the entire series.

The premise was appealing, but it also delivered on it right off the bat and exceeded expectations. In short, it\'s fun. But it does have feeling and depth without ever dropping overall comedic tone. The visual techniques are quite clever and effective. Voice acting was just right (I would be afraid to even approach the dub for something that extremely expressive). The bar might be low, but rarely I enjoyed something so unapologetically. You might just have to relate to the main character to get the same effect.

The main character, Tomoko might be the most socially awkward anime character of all time. She is very over the top and occasionally relatable. She is not likable at all, but I think that is the charm of the show, to watch her mess up which sounds very mean spirited to people with social anxiety. The story is fairly episodic, so you can watch most episodes out of...order. The show moves at a good pace and no moments feel like they drag on for more than that need to.

But do not be surprised as this show might not be very appealing to some.', 'It\'s quite rare that my feelings will change so dramatically after a single re-watch, but it\'s fair to say that this anime truly is...something interesting. I decided to rewatch it simply out of curiosity, due to how harsh I was with it the first time I watched it. I regarded it as a ""cringe-fest"" with a hollow main character, who has no real character development. While some of that is true, it\'s definitely a bit clearer what is not.The name of this anime suggests one thing right off the bat, & it\'s that Tomoko likes to put the blame on everyone else, before looking at...herself. I noticed that she tends to go through a ""cycle"" of emotions throughout the show, going from a viewpoint that everyone else around her is ""below her,"" to saying: ""I want all of their attention, right now."" Essentially going back & forth on hating her classmates, but also wanting to be popular in their eyes. What\'s kinda sad, is that she always tries so hard to do the latter, but then it almost always backfires & destroys any possibility that she\'ll be able to be seen as ""popular"" to her peers.Getting to the part that IS most definitely true, is the cringe. Yes, this is a very cringe-worthy anime. It\'s probably up there with the most cringe-worthy anime I\'ve seen. But, the main reason I find it to be less of a problem, & more of something to laugh at, is because of how silly most of the cringe tends to be. She is the sole cause of her misfortunes, & her misfortunes are always the cause of the cringe. She\'s so completely absorbed into her own world, that she fails to see how things could go wrong; even if the outcome will almost always be worse if you...just think about it for a second.This is where people would agree that she doesn\'t have much character development, but I\'d have to disagree. It\'s true that she takes a while to start showing any amount of development, but over the course of the anime, you can see her slowly building up the courage to talk to people around her. Going from someone who can barely make any amount of eye contact with someone, to approaching someone herself toward the end (albeit, she fails still, but I consider that development). Not to mention that she slowly eases up on the whole ""I hate my classmates"" idea, & tries to lean into thinking of ways to improve her High School life.Though, in the end, I have mixed feelings about recommending this anime. If you\'re not used to a lot of cringe, or just can\'t handle it, you should stay away. It\'s not easy to watch, & if you take it too seriously it just becomes a chore to watch.

It's about an antisocial girl who has no friends at her high school and each episode is usually about her doing dumb things to get friends or being in dumb situations.I was expecting much depth for a gag comedy series but there really is no overarching story sadly which is kinda disappointing. Additionally, her attempts at getting friends or her dumb situations are just really painful to watch. I have social anxiety but the way the main character Kuruki approaches these situations are just painful and not what I would really expect from a normal person...with social anxiety.

Michael Scott on The Office doing a Chris Rock routine he really shouldn\'t be is funny because he\'s surrounded by people who realize that it\'s inappropriate but does it infront of them with gusto. Most of Kuroki\'s fantasies stay in her head, and it\'s kind of a point of the show that she\'s so isolated nobody notices her, but the funniest bits are when somebody does notice she\'s doing something weird, and those moments are fairly rare. There\'s a bit where she makes herself out to be her idea of ""pretty"" and a couple kids are horrified and a couple bits where her mom walks in at the worst time and those tend to be the funniest, but otherwise it\'s mostly her weird thought and they are amusing, and she is a great character but there\'s never quite those moments that completely catch you off guard.That said, it is still a fun watch. I watched the dub version which I tend to do with comedy and I thought the voices were great and fit the character. I loved her weird little noises she makes and the broader sound design was pretty good. I think the funniest recurring gag was actually some of the music tracks they play when certain things happen, there this one sort of mystical Indian chanting that sounds like something from Akira and it\'s really funny when it kicks in and she\'s having a moment.Visually the show is somewhat average. Tomoko has an expressive and memorable design, but most of the background NPC\'s are your stock anime character template designs. There are some good cutaways that play with style and one really awesome shot in the finale, but I think it\'s more the weird design of the protagonist and her strange expressions that carry the show visually.I think they could have pushed the concept more, but it was still a good time for me. I\'d be interested in watching another season to see how it goes or picking up the manga but I feel like I wanted just a bit more from the show. is it really needs an audience.

Chou Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3432/Chou_Mashin_Eiyuuden_Wataru,"[""What happens when you adapt a late 80's action-comedy robot anime inspired by Bikkuriman, NES roleplaying games and 80's pop culture references (with the early 90's sequel) into the late 90's? You get a one with 90's pop culture references, much more serious shonen action and a rather clever social commentary on how the advancement of society has influenced people losing its kind heart to them and the others.The story starts with a slightly older Wataru losing its 'kind heart' due to Ankokudar and starting to act like a junior high delinquent. Shibaraku and Himiko takes Wataru back to Sokaizan, stating that he need to...save Sokaizan once again with the rainbow going monochrome again and save the civilliian and his kind heart.Kurama, the former-bad anthro bird guy is absent from this entry (although he was mentioned once) and was replaced by Suzume, a 90's glamorous tomboy girl which rides a different bird Mashin, with a evangelion cockpit. In addtion, an androgenous wooden toy Shoryushi (Toraou)  came alive as Seiju also joins the cast to find his master.New evil characters has been introduced, the Donarukami family, who overthrowned Soukaizan. comprising of a Fire demon king, ice-cold queen, Doran the sly drag queen, Dolk the mysterious swordsman voiced by Chisa Yokoyama of Sakura wars fame and Dode, the evil kid which later befriends Toraou. Out of the recurring villains seen in the Wataru series, the Donarukami family breaks the mold of the archetypal villians of the original series and depicted as a serious, empathetic and humane characters with its own development arc and proper explaination on what lead them to team with Ankokudar and steal the 'kind heart'.The animation has been significantly improved from the previous series, and possibly the most visually appealing one within the series. The transformation bank scene always looked great throughout this series, but this one is top-notch.Also, it is noted that in comparison to the original (and 2), which utilised a 'world boss' scheme, Chou introduces a 'stage boss' scheme. To accommodate this, the world building is more dense in Chou,  with every location having more variety. Each stages looks established and more 'realistic' and 'believable' in contrary to the absolute wacky, yet linear nature of the original series .In the original series, the bosses did not revert back to good civillians until the world has been cleared. Meanwhle in Chou, the bosses and the 'stage' reverts back to good, after each stage bosses has been defeated.One of the issues which this entry suffers from, is the inability to decide whether it wants to be a sequel, 90's reboot or a remake of the 1st series (although this was purposely done to avoid sequel fatigue) This entry is seemingly a remake with the focus on reverting Soukaizan back to its coloursed state like the original, but is a sequel in the sense that Wataru has already had the previous adventures with Shibaraku, Himiko and Toraou.However, nothing becomes more problematic with the overpowered nature of Sword-King Ryujinmaru, introduced in the MIDWAY of the series, with the ability to cut ANY objects and also allow to CUT DIMENSIONS (the only thing it can't cut is the kind heart). The mere existence of this breaks the latter half of the anime into a repetitive mess, nullifying the essential struggling required in most robot animes to make the battles thrilling. What makes it worse is that the later Ryujinmaru form has been underutilised, despite the anime including a very emotional development arc with Tama, a initially comic relief cat character which joins Wataru and his friends.From the 2020 sequel 'The Seven Spirits Of Ryujinmaru', fan states that it kinda retconned that this entry might not be fully canon and wasn't the entry which the fans of the original series wanted.Still, this is a great robot anime which worth a check, with its emotional themes.

D4DJ Petit Mix,https://myanimelist.net/anime/45782/D4DJ_Petit_Mix,"['Now I’m saying this as a D4DJ fan and as someone who was really looking forward to Petit Mix… but yeah we were robbed. With D4DJ: First Mix being as fun and as polished animation-wise as it was, watching the first few episodes of Petit Mix was pretty disappointing.When all we had to base our expectations on was the anime’s official poster/illustration, it was very easy to expect the same kind of quality as Garupa Pico, another chibi-style mini anime based on a big Bushiroad anime media series (Also made by one of the same animation studios as Petit Mix). But Garupa Pico uses...2D models for their characters, keeping quality consistent- and once I watched the first Petit Mix episode and saw that it used hand-drawn animation, I immediately got a little skeptical.And I was kinda right in thinking that way, because as the series went on, there were more animation quality drops. Sometimes the lineart was too thick or pixelated, sometimes the eyes or mouth were too high or low, and sometimes there were pretty iffy body proportions. And even looking past the animation quality, the animation style sometimes isn’t very nice to look at either- the highlights on the eyes and hair can be TOO shiny and bright, and it was very noticeable for me, because the episodes were released on YouTube at night in my timezone, and I often watched them while they were being Premiered.Outside the animation, the writing isn’t very strong either. It’s a mini anime after all, so I don’t expect it to have strong plot, but what I did expect was some good comedy. I know that Japanese humour is very different to the humour most English-speaking countries are used to, but at the very least, I do remember laughing at some of the jokes that Garupa Pico made. But despite the fact that Petit Mix had 26 episodes, I don’t remember laughing once. What I do remember were whole episodes where I wondered ‘…What’s going on? Is this supposed to make me laugh, or…?’ Episode 2 was the first episode that made me feel that way, and the fact that it was only the second episode… yeah.Overall, Petit Mix was overhyped by the official accounts, and because of that it was a pretty big disappointment for me and many other D4DJ fans. Some of the character interactions and episode premises are fun or entertaining to watch, but the animation holds it back and the comedy doesn’t land.

In some ways, this may be the most unusual Doraemon movie of all, given that it largely consists of a series of vignettes with the main characters mostly observing (and occasionally interfering with) what happens. Although I probably wouldn\'t want every Doraemon movie to follow this format, I like what they did here, and as a paleontologist,...the ""history of the world"" theme appeals to me.Although Nobita\'s friends aren\'t the focal characters here, it\'s funny to think about how they each became involved in Nobita\'s school project. Whereas Gian and Suneo had their own reasons to mooch off Nobita\'s work, Shizuka essentially ends up doing extra homework! (To be fair, if my friends had asked me to help with a school project for which I got to observe Earth history, I probably would have, too.) Other humorous details are included alongside the end credits, during which we get to see the school report that Nobita and his friends put together. the ""history of the world"" theme appeals to me.Although Nobita\'s friends aren\'t the focal characters here, it\'s funny to think about how they each became involved in Nobita\'s school project.

Elf wo Karu Mono-tachi II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1046/Elf_wo_Karu_Mono-tachi_II,"[""Sometimes after watching a serious anime you need to watch something a little lighter and less intense. Like in my case, after watching Blood+ this is just what I needed to make me laugh and feel optimistic about the world again. There's never really been a lot of talk about this show and I only stumbled across it myself because I wanted to see what other shows had Shelly Calene-Black as part of the cast. This review will be about both “Those Who Hunt Elves” 1 & 2 since I'm a marathon watcher and the show might as well have been one complete anime....like Saiyuki...[why give a series a different title, if it's just a continuation of the first series?]~artBoth part 1 & 2 are only a few years apart, like 3 – 4 years so the art barely changes. Part 1 was made in the 90s and therefore has that 90's anime look and the second part was 90's inspired so the shapes and coloring are very similar....but you can tell that the second part was slightly newer because the coloring was a little smoother and edges aren't as sharp.~soundI watched this show in English dub, and the biggest perceptible difference between Those Who Hunt Elves 1 & 2 is the dialogue. Just like with the first part of Saiyuki the language is seriously hardcore, people were calling each other bitches and even f-bombs were being dropped every now and then. And frankly, I like anime shows that talk dirty like that, maybe because that's how I speak and it just seems more genuine that way or it just seems funnier to me. I just don't find many people who speak in a squeaky clean fashion anymore....not since grammar school anyway.But I guess as compensation for cleaning up the language in the second part we get Shelley Calene-Black as Celcia which is cool because she has this incredible knack for conveying a lot of sarcasm and is way funny....although the first actress who played Celcia wasn't bad either.~storyThe story concept is pretty original: 3 individuals from the world as we know it get transported to a fantasy land that has elves and a bunch of other strange creatures. Due to a botched ritual to send these 3 individuals home, Elf High-Priestess Celcia scatters the elvish spell symbols all over this new world and now they have to go around stripping female elves to recover the spell symbols. But even though the concept sounds original...it's really sorta like Inuyasha in a way with the collection of the Shikon shards.Also the narration is rather simplistic...not that I'm saying anything is wrong with that. Actually I think keeping it simple really worked for this anime, it allowed us to really enjoy the humor without having to look for hidden meanings or interpret any subtext, there weren't any complicated plot twists or surprise character appearances. Just a new and funny adventure that gets resolved each episode.~charactersI really love small casts. It seems more intimate that way and it makes the viewer feel like they are part of the gang. With a cast as small as this [4 main characters] you get the opportunity to become familiarized with each character and although this is not a hard-hitting dramatic anime with overly complex characters you still get a little insight on how each character thinks as they develop along with the show.I had no favorite character for this series, I liked all four characters equally. Junpei, being the only guy in the crew, was very funny he's very blunt and eventho he doesn't admit it...deep down we know he loves stripping those elf-women naked. Celcia is by far the most sarcastic, her comedic timing and one-liners keep me laughing non-stop. Airi I like because she puts out this refined Meryl Streep Oscar-winning vibe on the surface, but deep down she's pretty sadistic and likes toying with people. I also liked how nobody can fool her, she's really more of a psychologist than an actress. And then there's Ritsuko this teeny-bopper girl with a severe military fetish who likes to play with landmines and grenades and has a pet tank that's possessed by a cat-demon and a teddy bear that shits toilet-paper. They are all so very original.~verdictdon't pick this title and expect the reinvention of the wheel...that's not what this show is about. It is a funny, simplistic show that makes fun of itself and the fantasy genre of anime. This show has a decent amount of slapstick which is always good however if you are a quick-witted person who likes a lot of fast-paced witty banter and verbal exchange then you will truly appreciate this show more.

I\'m not sure whether this is because the second season is better executed, or whether I just became more tolerant of anime humour by the time I got around to watching it. Maybe a bit of both.Whatever the reason is, it\'s safe to say that I found ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" considerably funnier, in particular the abuse-filled exchanges between Celcia and Junpei. The...stories seem better too - even though it\'s essentially same thing as the first season, the episodics seem more imaginative and interesting. It also feels like there\'s even less serious content than the first season, which is good because the first season fell flat on its face on the occasions when it tried to be more serious. This isn\'t to say the plot doesn\'t have its problems, a glaring one being the lack of urgency on the part of the protagonists, which totally contradicts the events that led up to the second season. The ending was also poor, and was in fact so meaningless that I\'d struggled to remember what happened within a couple of weeks of watching it.

Oh, and they\'ve added a new combination of open/ending themes. The new opening is nothing to write home about, but the new ending theme is great.""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" may satisfy the conventional goals of a good sequel - building and improving upon its predecessor - but the first season was so far from being good that this second season needed to improve a lot to be considered good itself. Unsurprisingly, it falls short. It\'s funny at times, but not consistently so; it\'s better, but still suffers from too many of the original\'s problems.

It really looks bad, seriously.The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show.

Dance in the Vampire Bund,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6747/Dance_in_the_Vampire_Bund,"['In one of SHAFT\'s latests, Dance in the Vampire Bund, there is actually very little to dance about. SHAFT usually has a knack for finding strange source materials and then adapting them in interesting new ways that break the troupes of their genres. Usually is the key word in that last sentence. I\'m trying to write a non-bias review, but it\'s inevitable to say Dance in the Vampire Bund is not a good anime. But! At the same time it isn\'t a terrible anime. But what Bund is, is absolutely average. There\'s nothing this anime does to set it apart from other second-rate anime about...vampires or political conquest. At first, everything that happens you\'ll feel like ""Hey well I kind of thought that was coming"" and by the end you\'ll be like ""Wait? Was that a plot twist?"" Note that is a review on the anime only and from what I\'ve seen of the manga, this is a poor adaption of what could have been a much better experience.Story: 4/10Mina Tepes, the vampire princess has decided to establish a safehaven for all vampires. Through various means she gains political ground for the establishment of ""the Bund."" Of course, exposing to the world that vampires exist and that they will be Japan\'s next door neighbor is troublesome and the events told in this story are about them. I think. Mina also happens to own some fancy Japanese High School where our protagonist attends and our protagonist also happens to be a werewolf whose dad works directly under Mina who also happens to attend her own school. Huh? I\'m confused too. The story becomes derailed whenever Akira, the protagonist, is focused on, because to be frank, the anime isn\'t about him. It\'s about Mina Tepes, but SHAFT decided to make the back plot some nonsensical love story (which only resolves with loli-rape - I\'m dead serious). Oh, and be warned, there\'s most likely a sequel coming.Art: 5/10Oho. SHAFT is one of my favorite animation companies because they always do interesting things with their anime and try and tread new grounds by playing with color or 3D elements or optical illusions. SHAFT is also one of the most underpaid and overworked studios in the current anime market and thus they have an incredibly low budget. The only reason I can make sense of why Bund\'s animation quality was so low was because at the same time SHAFT had been working on the eye-candy ""Hidamari Skecth Hoshimittsu."" Almost everything about Bund in comparison animation-wise fails. The character movement is repulsive and over-dramatic. Every time a character does something they have a strange angle placed on them, then a zoom onto a random body part, followed by a slowed sentence that it wouldn\'t matter if it was even said or not. The only time you really see SHAFT\'s personal touch is when they zoom in on the eyes of the characters talking, which by the end of the anime was more of a nuisance than a pleasure. The clarity was also a huge problem. I started watching this anime in low quality TV rips, and then moved up to bigger and better looking files. There was no difference. The entire first episode had this weird green tint to it that made it unpleasing even to look at. The clarity fluctuates too (how fun!), so it\'s hard to enjoy when you have to up the brightness of your media player to view the episode normally. Oh, and other than Mina, every character looks boring. The main character looks like every other cliche male protagonist, and there\'s nothing even to set him apart from the other characters visually. Yuki, one of the female characters, is almost as interesting as Yuki from 11eyes (Note: Yuki from 11eyes sucks and she looks generic). I still like SHAFT\'s animation style, which is a plus for this anime, but the moments of camera genius that often appear in other SHAFT works are definitely missing here.Sound: 7/10Nothing to complain about. The opening and ending are both nice but nothing memorable. Character voices are fitting (I enjoyed Mina\'s) but once again aren\'t anything to flaunt. BGM was quiet and rather uninteresting most of the time, but nothing bad.Character: 4/10Vampires, werewolves, tigresses, oh my! DERP. Mina Tepes is the one interesting character in this entire anime and every other character exists solely to support her. She\'s the under-estimated soon-to-be queen of vampires who tries and fights the old traditions of vampires to finally reveal her people to the world so they will not longer be persecuted. Kind of like a Martin Luther King Jr. of vampires, except in the form of a ten-year-old girl and not black. Hey, strong lolita leads are cool in all (Pani Poni Dash! I\'m looking at you) but SHAFT needed to realize that there were other characters in this anime. The list includes a Chinese Tigress, a blood-sucking ""older sister,"" a vampire with massive eyebrows, a priestess, and about thirty five thousand big breasted women. There\'s actually very little to say about any of them except that they\'re bland. As soon as they\'re introduced you know exactly what their personality is. Mina is the only dynamic developed character, and thank god she is, because more than half of the anime is spent following her around. Akira on the other hand manages to grab as much time as Mina and ends up wasting it all. He\'s inctredibly undeveloped and the only point of appeal (kind of) is that he is a werewolf. COOL (BUT NOT REALLY). Even when he\'s a werewolf he most of the time gets the crapped knocked out of him and that\'s when a Deus ex Machina comes into play. Yuki is also an undeveloped annoying ""for some reason it\'s a harem"" bitch who gets in the way of the main ""relationship"" between Akira and Mina. She has absolutely nothing that separates her from other female characters in any anime ever and could easily be a background character that accidentally wandered onto the foreground.Enjoyment: 5/10SHAFT tries to do the impossible and fails when they tried to make a show about political warfare with a touch of ""romance"" and then ended with a harem and fighting with plot twists as original as ""I AM YOUR FATHER"". It\'s frustrating seeing how much potential this show had. I can safely say that after such a thrilling experience I wiped the anime off my hard-drive and will have probably forgotten most of it by tomorrow morning.Overall: 5/10That isn\'t to say that there aren\'t worse anime, because hot damn there are. I thoroughly enjoyed when Mina was on camera and thoroughly disliked whenever she wasn\'t. The annoying ""wait for season two where we explain what the final episode was even about card"" is pulled too. The only thing I can say is that for an anime about vampires, this show falls right into the pit with the other ones already out there, and unlike Hellsing, does not bring massive guns or blood. It brings one thing and one thing only - Mina Tepes - and if you don\'t like it, then this anime is definitely not for you. vampires or political conquest.

For me, it was absolutely the best vampire anime I've ever seen. I can't really say that I'm obsessed with vampires, but it's certainly an interesting genre. Unfortunately there isn't really a lot of animes which use this theme to its fullest. In that sense, Vampire Bund has managed to utilize all the glory of the vampire legend and myth.Story: 10As it goes with most vampire stories, Vampire Bund's plot revolves around the vampire princess, or vampire queen. However, it's really the subtle things that impresses me...the most. I suppose most people would just pass them off as whims, but SHAFT has a knack at making an impression of the subtlest things which brings the plot together. Most vampire stories seem to forget that time moves, and are always trapped in one time-frame but Vampire Bund is nothing like that. Vampire Bund's story spans centuries of vampire history and glory, and the darkness within. It shows that vampires are not just creatures sleeping in coffins locked away in the middle ages, but also advance in technology and culture as humans do. It's an enormous theme and it's certainly not an easy task to depict it, but SHAFT does a great job. I suppose most people expect there would be a 2nd season because there's still another last boss and because of the manga, but if I'm not wrong, SHAFT doesn't intend on making a sequel. It's a lot better leaving the ending as it is and letting the audience imagine the story after, or just read the manga.Art: 8It doesn't get any better in abstract animation than with SHAFT. They make the simplest scenes look cinematic and grand. It seems they have been slacking a lot since ef, though. Basically, there's very little movement and lots of shadows. Vampire Bund seems to be lacking in the shadow effect SHAFT loves so much, however. In a sense, it could have been a lot better. However, it's still very impressive nonetheless.Sound: 7The OP and ED are not the best you can get from anime songs, but it's complimentary. On the contrary, the sound effects are excellent, as expected from SHAFT. Many scenes would have been very empty and felt meaningless without the sound effects, but SHAFT always makes it worthwhile with the perfect timing and tone.Character: 8As it is, the story revolves around one person, the vampire queen. But this doesn't mean everyone else are just pawns. Yes, the side characters may seem to have very little screen time, but they make a powerful impression every time they come onto the chess board. Unorthodox as it may be, Vampire Bund never depicts the mains as powerful and unbeatable. Instead it shows that they bleed and feel the pain, and don't live on their own but are supported by various characters.Enjoyment: 10Vampire Bund is one of the few animes I've managed to finish in just a day. It's so enjoyable and interesting that I couldn't take my eyes of it. The conversations, culture, history, philosophy, and action makes every minute worthwhile. I haven't read the manga, and I probably would in a while, but I doubt I would enjoy it as much as the anime.

So much that I finished it all in one day.I decided to give a summery of the anime because I dont believe the synopsis is fair to it.Story:A 17 yr old boy has had all his memories erased due to an incident that happened a year and a half ago.  What he does remember is a promise he made to this girl seven years ago, to always be together.  That girl turns...out to be the Queen of the Vampires, who he meets again, and shares a special bond with her.  And so the story begins.The art is beautiful.  So much detail, and colors.The sound is ok. I didn\'t really pay any attention to it, to be honest.Characters:  Really well developed considering there was only 12 episodes to work with.  If you put attention, you\'re not left lost or confused.Enjoyment:  I don\'t know why everyone gave it such low ratings.  I really liked Dancing in the Vampire Bund.  Though, the first episode made me dubious.  It\'s said that the audience bases their opinions of what they\'re watching within the first 10 seconds of their program.  Well, I\'m glad I gave it till the second episode.Overall:  8.5Dance in the Vampire Bund was everything I was looking for.  Supernatural with romance and some action (the blood was a bonus).Anyone looking for a action-packed romance anime, should definitely give this a chance.Sorry if it\'s not the best review, I\'m still an amateur at this:PTo all you ""Not Helpful"" and ""Helpful"" people too, feedback is appreciated.

[;', 'Okay, so Dance in the Vampire Bund. Or Bland, as I call it. First off, I had to look up what a bund was, because I thought I was missing something. Turns out I wasn\'t. It\'s just bad. I won\'t just stop there though, I will explain in detail why I think it\'s bad.Story: 3Imagine if you will, the most painfully generic and dreadful story you can think of. Take what\'s chic. Vampires, right? Yeah, I mean, everybody loved Twilight, right? They\'ll like it even more now! Since you know, vampire shows haven\'t been beaten to death since the 1931 film version of Dracula. The...vampire, in this story, is Mina Tepes, the descendant of Vlad the Impaler we can only presume. Since you know, he was definitely a vampire, because that\'s what Dracula says. This time around though, the poor little vampires just want to be peacefully accepted into society. Two things come to mind when I hear this, the first being Mary Shelley\'s ""Frankenstein"" (1818), where a ""monster"" tries to integrate itself into society, and is nonetheless feared and shunned by everybody. The second is the anime Vampire Knight, where vampires and humans already co-exist to a small degree in a school setting, where the \'Day class\' is occupied by humans and the \'Night class\' by vampires.It goes further to hit every cliche in the arsenal, where the vampire chooses to attend school with her servant, who also happens to be a werewolf, the very school she of course has rule over, and the defiant student council wants to fight back for the school they most certainly love. Perhaps this wasn\'t meant to be an original story. For the rest of the review therefore, I will look at it as a re-telling of all the old legends of vampires and stuff like that. Story itself though, gets a 3 for lack of original content.Art: 5Shaft has always had a unique style of animation. That\'s what makes me a fan. Being a fan I\'ve seen many of their other works. Having seen many of their other works, I recognize re-used animations and stills, re-colored to fit the characters in the current show. Clearly not their best effort. The animation itself however, is fairly decent, smooth, and with consistent characters and interesting angles. On the contrary, it\'s not as stylized as other Shaft works, such as Bakemonogatari or Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, which means it does tend to just look a little generic compared to their other works. Also, there is no actual animation in the ending theme. Knowing Shaft, they will change that soon, but for now, 5\'d.Sound: 4The opening and ending themes are good. Everything else is generic, or even inappropriate. Comical sound effects mixed in with serious conversations set you off, and in my opinion, all the important voice actors have done better work in other shows.Character: 2Here\'s one of the biggest disappointments of this show. Where they could have gone with creative, decent characters, there\'s just an eyesore lackluster display of crashing waves of mediocrity. The main character (at least, I think she is?) Mina Tepes,  is basically some sick combination of Remilia and Flandre Scarlet, as well as Nagi Sanzenin but without the nerdy side. An oppressive, static loli vampire queen. She shows two sides - the dominating, quick-witted personality you would expect from any major boss in a shonen show, and the slightly irritable yet teasing-playful unavoidable Tsundere archetype. Not exactly something to go in the record book.Then there\'s the other ""main"" character - Akira Kaburagi Regendorf. He made a promise as a child. Creative. He\'s a werewolf. Creative. He\'s a bullheaded protagonist that will go to unnecessary lengths to help the one he loves, even if he ends up just getting in the way. Creative. That, and if I were to describe him physically (short and somewhat spiky brown hair, school uniform, ..........) I\'d run out of things to say about that fast. Complains a lot, same old, same old.Enjoyment: 2Unless this anime is just a satire on anime or attempt to kill the industry, it\'s not worth watching. At all. I found myself checking the timer to see how much longer until each episode finished, so that I could be done with it and go on to bigger and better things, like staring at my computer\'s wallpaper.Overall: 3Unless you\'re an undefeated vampire champion striving to peck up every last piece of lore you can relating to vampires, I would avoid watching Dance in the Vampire Bland.

If you\'re looking for a vampire show with lots of action, there are many, many other, better choices.', 'I did not read the manga so the review is based entirely upon the anime. I don\'t really describe what happens in the series and spoils are from none to very little. Look at the description if you wish to know what the anime is fully about.Story-7: Wow, vampires that have been hiding among us for centuries! I\'ve never heard of anything like that before! That was sarcasm, if it wasn\'t obvious enough. Honestly though, yes it is overused and this anime doesn\'t pull it off as well as many other books or movies. But it doesn\'t have to. What I find very well done...is how they justify their ability to hide and survive in the time they have been oblivious to common humans. In the beginning the story is very poorly developed but everything starts adding up around the latter half of the series. Don\'t give it up too fast.Art-8: Everyone loves a naked 10 year old right? But seriously, it\'s not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Although there are times when where they directly focus on her sexuality as a child, these are usually short and aren\'t that bad. So people should just take a chill pill. The animation moves in a way that Bakemonogatari does (yes I\'m using it as an example, but in a good way) in that random motions and images are presented and there is a lot of emphasis on speech. Overall, expect fight scenes to have a dark undertone and blood is apparent when bodies are being cut in half. But that\'s just being realistic isn\'t it?Sound-6: The background music doesn\'t stand out. The voice actors also don\'t really make themselves apparent. I do, however, enjoy the sounds that represent pain. They are far more realistic than many other animes and have almost a surreal quality.Character-8: The characters are bland and some come in and out of existence way too suddenly. You\'re left with a ""Who the hell was that guy?"" kind of feeling a lot of the time. Despite this the Vampire princess is actually a very complex person and it stands to reason that  most of the character development revolves around her. The rest of the characters are basically just there although some things do get explained during the last couple of episodes. I don\'t see enough character development based off of Akira but i still like his interactions with the rest of the characters.Enjoyment-9: I actually enjoyed this series very much. Although the whole series wasn\'t ""excellent,"" it was still a good watch. There are some very unpredictable moments which surprised me when I first read the reviews, stating that it is completely unoriginal.

I\'ll probably get lots of haters for this who try to only see the things wrong the with the anime and people who just can\'t sit back and enjoy.

In the beginning the story is very poorly developed but everything starts adding up around the latter half of the series. Don\'t give it up too fast.Art-8: Everyone loves a naked 10 year old right? But seriously, it\'s not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Although there are times when where they directly focus on her sexuality as a child, these are usually short and aren\'t that bad. So people should just take a chill pill. The animation moves in a way that Bakemonogatari does (yes I\'m using it as an example, but in a good way) in that random motions and images are presented and there is a lot of emphasis on speech. Overall, expect fight scenes to have a dark undertone and blood is apparent when bodies are being cut in half. But that\'s just being realistic isn\'t it?Sound-6: The background music doesn\'t stand out. The voice actors also don\'t really make themselves apparent. I do, however, enjoy the sounds that represent pain. They are far more realistic than many other animes and have almost a surreal quality.Character-8: The characters are bland and some come in and out of existence way too suddenly.

Dance in the Vampire Bund is an anime that is sticking to the manga in the big picture sense. However, it lacks the details, both in the characters and the plot, that make this manga about vampires insightful and clever.The anime has a lot of fillers which may have been intended to be creative, but turned out to be ridiculous. I really wasn\'t expecting much of a 13 episode anime in terms of the development of the story, but the amount of fillers will probably result in the abrupt truncation of...the story  (as opposed to anime where the story is cut short with respect to the manga but have well rounded endings)The art is very ""meh""... They use different cinematic techniques to emphasize scenes but it gets repetitive, which together with the insane amounts of censoring, make the storyline of some episodes difficult to follow. The music just sounds like a cut and pasta from a random anime--I was expecting Dance in the Vampire Bund  to have some good music as in Bakemonogatari)I will admit that when I published the first draft of this review around episode 3, I was biased biased by the fact that I am a big fan of the manga.

But, now I guess that I must say, you should spend those 24 minutes reading the manga =).', ""Before I begin this review, I would like to make it very clear that I have not read the Dance In The Vampire Bund manga, nor do I have any immediate plans to do so, and this review is based entirely on the animated adaptation Thus, don't complain about how the manga was good, because that is completely irrelevant to how much I fucking hated the Vampire Bund anime.The series starts off with an interesting premise, namely a TV gameshow discussing all the increasing amounts of signs that vampires walk among us. Although Vampires are hardly an original premise... actually, they're one of the least...original and overused premises in modern media, but I digress... introducing their existence to the unsuspecting public via the media is certainly a new one. On paper, this reads like a fantastic deconstruction of the vampire genre, but horribly executed and turns into a rather large clusterfuck. Amidst the TV show, Mina Tepes, a small blonde loli girl who looks distinctly similar to Evangeline A.K. McDowell, announces the existence of Vampires, and declares herself to be their ruler.The above becomes largely forgettable, though, as something of an Episode 0 sort of thing, and the following episode picks up with the actual plot, introducing our protagonist Akira. I call him our protagonist in the very lightest sense of the word, since from the very beginning it was painfully obvious that the staff behind the show care about one character, and one character only, and that is Mina. Despite being our supposed protagonist, Akira shows next to no personality in the series, being a bland plot vehicle instead. As it turns out, he and Mina go quite a way back, but Akira has amnesia. Apparently, he is a member of the Earth Clan of Werewolves, and is bound to protect Mina.Yes, you read that right. This features both Vampires and Werewolves. Where have I heard that one before?What follows is a rather poorly-paced plot that takes several episodes to truly commence, and when it does, falls flat on its face. Whilst i'd rather not spoil too much, Mina takes a rather drastic choice within the series when the shit hits the fan, and starts to take a turn for the worst as a character. What doesn't help is that said decision seriously clashes with how she is portrayed in the previous episode, making her out to be a rather inconsistent character. At the same time, the plot that ensues is very generic, bland, and completely fails to ignite any sense of interest, with the exception being towards the end when the show begins to pick up.All of this, however, is only so much detraction, and could still make for a passable show if it wasn't for my one and only massive complaint about this show: The directing. Put simply, Akiyuki Shinbo needs a good, hard kick in the 'nads for the horrible, horrible job he has done directing this show. For a start, the art style is extremely bland, and the colouring feels very undersaturated, making a very weak atmosphere for the series. But more importantly, the animation is horrific. Not since Evangelion have I seen such blatant corner-cutting, and at the very least Evangelion put it to good artistic use. Here, they repeat animation wholesale, and constantly use longshots, along with some very blatant and annoying censors. And just to put the cherry on the top, when the animation hits its low, can you guess what they did? They mixed in live action shots to save animation, if you believe they would honestly sink so low. But worst of all, the eye closeups. Oh dear lord the eye closeups. There's an extreme close up of an eyeball around every few seconds, or at least once every two minutes. In one episode, I actually counted how many, and guess what? 54. In a single episode. I am not making this up.In essence, this show is garbage. It's hard to find more than a handful of redeeming features to it, aside from the fact that the manga might be something passable.Final Words: Don't waste your time on it.Animation/Graphics: 1/10Story/Plot: 4/10Music/Background: 7/10Voice Acting: N/AOverall: 3/10For Fans Of: Bakemonogatari, Trinity Blood original and overused premises in modern media, but I digress... introducing their existence to the unsuspecting public via the media is certainly a new one.

However, the show did not amount to all the hype. D in Disorder is a befitting name for this show. Be wary of Spoilers.Story-The story begins with Mina Tepes (The Queen of vampires) unveiling the existence of the vampire on a game show. What happens afterwards came as a surprise..At first you thought the show was about protecting the existence of vampires and somehow requisitioning a school as a corporate asset will stifle all insurrection.Right. Only opaque flashbacks are shown between...the Kaburagi and the heroine. Why did he a werewolf willingly protect the Queen of vampires? We shall never know. Before this show seemed to have that allure of becoming a political thriller in combination with a supernatural series. Instead we get a disjointed story about a guy who has little reason to have feelings towards his so-called master and then an arcane human enemy that we don't know about. I beg the question why didn't a person of the Japanese goverment become an enemy of Mina Tepes in her plans to create a utopian environment for vampires?Then we have the school setting. Do you really think kids will be a monumental threat to the Queen of vampires designs? These supernatural stories always base themselves upon using the high school setting as their background setting. The main character rebels against Mina tepe's hegemonic rule over his classmates, even though supposedly they have a master to servant relationship. Oh wait, there's more. Yes, if you thought this story was dysfunctional think again. A couple of episodes later.There's a planned coup to usurp the Queen of vampires position. This segment comes after the fighting between her former servant and the vampires. One of the nobles tried to seize power.The servant comes to the aid of his master again even though he tried to extirpate her from top to bottom not to long ago. This show ends with the abortive coup and the consolidating of her power. Let's seize more high schools, so I Mina Tepes have another excuse to show off the litany of flowers on my lavish dresses and bras. If you have a small tit fetish then enroll in Mina Tepes's district now. Overall a lacklustre piece of work, riddled with questions more than answers.Art-The art is similar to shafts prototypical art pieces. The animation tries to augment the characters with appealing surroundings, but lets face it the animation generally occurs only in a few separate settings. There's nothing remotely beguiling about the art, except in the ending song scenes.Sound-Typical J-pop nothing new to see here at all. The music tries to acclimate to the dramatic points in the plot. However the serious taste in music is not warranted by a less than surpising or predictable outcome. Then we have the gothic music interposed with the vampiric theme, trying to effectually portray the story as a creepy vampire story.Characters-First we have the blonde bomb shell herself Mina tepes, who exudes the pretentious little brat role that's quite abound in anime these days. Maybe it's her status of queen of the vampires that is used to justify this bombastic behaviour..Kaburagi is the typical reckless idiot that would make any level-headed question his existence in the show. He also is very naive and  cannot figure anything out regardless if it's placed right in front of his face. Do we need more facile morons in anime, that are pervayers of naivety?The rest of the cast I couldn't care less about.Just a tasteless supporting cast. Nothing needed to be said.Enjoyment- My enjoyment is poorer than the other categories because I had some remedial expectations for this show. Instead of an enthralling piece of politics with some semblance of realism, we get a inane piece of garbage is poorly executed.Overall- Some may think I thought of this as an abject failure due to my denunciations. However it's more disappointing experience than an exasperating one.

Vampires are awesome but here, they are lame. Really lame. Seriously, the story doesn\'t even make sense. I mean it\'s okay if the queen of vampires is rich, like the richest in the world, but being able to pay off the ""entire debt of Japan"", this is BULLSHIT!! Besides, nobody knew about the existence of vampires because they were ""hiding"" for millennia. That\'s okay, I think it\'s...great that they keep their existence a secret. But collecting money for thousands of years without ANYBODY noticing their wealth, it\'s like taking humans for retards.Basically, it\'s like vampires were running the world economy but nobody knew it was them because nobody knew they exist and that is bullshit.The art is good, nothing else to say here. It gets a 7.I didn\'t pay attention to the sound, so can\'t say it\'s good or bad. Neutral so 5.The characters suck. I hate fake lolis. Mina\'s been living for ages yet she tries to impress high school students with the statement of a math formula. I can do it even without living for millennia. It\'s like: ""Look how awesome I am, I know basic math formulas even though I\'m a loli who lived for so long I crap fossils"". There\'s nothing impressive here. And why stay a loli when you can be hot, with a mature ladylike body (the body gets +2)? Just for that, the characters gets a 0 and a +2 for the hot body.Enjoyment... The first episode was bitter because it was too slow on development. Watching the second one was like shoving food up your ass till it comes out from your mouth.

I don\'t enjoy that.', ""CURRENTLY ON EP 5.Alright. First off, let's get out of the way, the reason why I'm having trouble with this anime.FOR THE LOVE OF PISS, SHAFT, LEARN HOW TO ANIMATE.If it's one thing I love about the evolution of anime, is how natural animation is becoming. It began early with KyotoAni, who despite being money whores, animate like gods. Clannad was an animation masterpiece, where even the comedy felt natural, everything flowed. This was 2006, mind you. Later on they follwed with The Melancholy, which was a genius mix of character and animation flow. ToraDora was the next piece I loved the animation for. No...weird angles, small movements that just added to the over all picture. And most recently, Kimi ni Todoke, which took it's original style (from the manga) and added wonderful animation to make it a light hearted, lovely anime.SHAFT JUST TOOK THIS AND MURDERED IT.The constant zooming in and about the place as if it were a shitty matrix remake. The crappy mouth animation that dosn't fit the faces at all. The random hair blowing in the NON EXISTANT wind, for no apparently reason. SHAFT isn't being daringly artistic, no, they're just being stupid.PLEASE, FIX THIS.Onto the story. I don't hate it, I don't like it. I was looking foward to an intense political drama, from what I've heard of the manga. Instead, I was given a vauge remake (with shitty animation /shot) the seems to more be focused on a romance. So ok, I like romance stories. So I will hold my judgement on this until later episodes.Character. Heck, I could watch this show blind and still know what was going on, the characters are so freaking bland and obvious. I know, I know, anime is not without cliche, but please. PLEASE. Do they have to be /this/ bad? I see little room for developtment/major growth. What I do see, is how this is going to end. However, I will hold out for suprises.Art. Well, animation aside, the art annoyes me to. It seems rather messy, blotchy, and overly shiney, like a new comer to photoshop who hasn't ever been tutored, or heck, bothered to learn how to use color properly. Mina's hair is about the only thing in the anime I like, in terms of art. This, combined with the animation from hell, means I would probably enjoy watching this blind. However, I don't understand enough japanese to do so.Overall, this anime has potentional, which it currently will probably never achieve. But y'know what? I'll see it through to the end. Damn it. weird angles, small movements that just added to the over all picture.

This anime is for you"", 'This is a spectacular piece of shit and I can\'t recommend it to anyone, no matter how vampire anime deprived they might be.My #1 criticism is the colossal shitshow that is the art style. It\'s difficult describe with words, but it\'s that kind of ""art"" where someone throws a whole lot of motifs around that *should* be artistic but the way it\'s all put together just produces a cringy mess. Art in general is highly subjective, but in this anime it\'s comparable to showing up at a high-class show in Paris and instead of seeing masterful works through the centuries you actually see what happens...when a methhead eats twenty tacos then goes potty on some canvas. (I\'ll leave further art comparisons alone since getting into the whole ""inflated art prices are actually thinly-veiled attempts at money laundering"" isn\'t anime related.) The nail in the coffin (HA) for me was the poorly Photoshopped photographs that are spliced in generously; in the final episode, there\'s an obvious picture of New York City with the Empire State Building right in the middle...despite the series taking place in Tokyo. Lmao.My second major complaint is the loli crap. Fetishes are one thing, and DanceBund certainly does the whole ""my body may LOOK like a nine year old, but I\'m ACTUALLY a seventy-four thousand year old vampire queen"" meme to justify showing prepubescent T&A, but it\'s the literal child molesting during a later arc that really pissed me off. There\'s a boy and he\'s shown making out (complete with pornographic spit exchanges and sound effects) with a grown woman before they fondle and so on. I get that Shaft were trying to be edgy--and again, I don\'t care at all about personal fetishes--but this was just fucking gross.My third primary complaint is the shitty storytelling. As the series progresses it becomes constructed more like a crappy Youtuber shouting at a camera about whatever hot topic is in the news: jump cuts, jump cuts, jump cuts, random pictures, random Photoshopped images, random colors, jump cuts, cump juts, tuj mumps............it all just melts together with the terrible art direction to cement my opinion that this was directed by an idiot. And it didn\'t HAVE to be! The actual narrative is pretty good even in spite of the dumb central plot (vampire-werewolf forbidden love). There are ever-so-brief glimpses of what could have been, like political scheming, vampires revealing themselves to the world, artificial blood, power struggles, and more, but it\'s all lost in jump cuts and shitty Photoshopped images.I don\'t recommend anyone watch this. There are zero redeeming qualities at the end of the series, and I honestly regret wasting any amount of time on this steaming turd. when a methhead eats twenty tacos then goes potty on some canvas. (I\'ll leave further art comparisons alone since getting into the whole ""inflated art prices are actually thinly-veiled attempts at money laundering"" isn\'t anime related.) The nail in the coffin (HA) for me was the poorly Photoshopped photographs that are spliced in generously; in the final episode, there\'s an obvious picture of New York City with the Empire State Building right in the middle...despite the series taking place in Tokyo. Lmao.My second major complaint is the loli crap. Fetishes are one thing, and DanceBund certainly does the whole ""my body may LOOK like a nine year old, but I\'m ACTUALLY a seventy-four thousand year old vampire queen"" meme to justify showing prepubescent T&A, but it\'s the literal child molesting during a later arc that really pissed me off. There\'s a boy and he\'s shown making out (complete with pornographic spit exchanges and sound effects) with a grown woman before they fondle and so on. I get that Shaft were trying to be edgy--and again, I don\'t care at all about personal fetishes--but this was just fucking gross.My third primary complaint is the shitty storytelling.

I can\'t say ""characters with large breasts"" because absolutely every female character (besides the princess in her normal form, ironically) has such abhorrently large ones that they dominate the screen.I supposed some viewers don\'t like the fact that SHAFT messes with the chronology and creates scenes that aren\'t in the manga, but I enjoy this. I don\'t want to to simply see a manga in motion;...I want a different artistic experience. For example, the first episode of Dance was a parody of Japanese variety shows and was completely original--and so far it\'s still the best episode in my opinion.Anyway, if you like action and ""hot babes,"" you\'ll probably enjoy this show much more than I do. For now, I\'m going to d/l the eps every week and hope they stray from the fanservice and delve deeper into the political aspect. I want a different artistic experience.

No, but seriously now. This was phenomenal!I knew this show existed via cover art that I\'ve seen in various places.

It's been heavily criticised for having sexualised content involving a character who looks like a child and when it was released outside of Japan there was a big fuss about censorship as various companies grappled with whether or not to cut some of the more controversial content. It's a series I've avoided because it looked crass in the same vein as Strike Witches or Upotte but I was asked to review it in spite of it being, according to the requester “a not very good show” due to it being a  prototype in the...way it's directed for a lot of studio Shafts later works. For those of you unfamiliar with shaft, they're the ones behind the Rec OVA, which was terrible. They also did Ef: A Tale of Memories, which was sub-par. They also did Natsu no Arashi which was decent enough and Madoka which was actually really good. Thus  far, my experiences with their work has been pretty mixed. But I did just review a masterpiece so I may as well take up the request and look at this anime to see where it falls  on the spectrum of Shaft productions and to decide for ourselves if it really isn't very good.Story:After several attacks where young ladies are left with marks on their necks, a television program has a panel to discuss the possibility of vampires existing. The program includes a special guest, a woman claiming to be the vampire queen. She presents the preserved arm of the vampire who has, supposedly been attacking people. This prompts him to reveal himself and the existence of vampires is revealed to the public as is the face of the true vampire queen. She announces her plan to take a patch of land she owns within Japan and create a bund for vampires. Things take a turn when the vampire queen, Mina Tepes, begins showing interest in amnesiac High school student Kaburagi Akira. What's the connection betwixt them and can she successfully establish her bund?There are several narrative issues to the series. The first is that it lacks narrative cohesion. There are factors of vampire society that get established early on and then retconned later in the series. It can't even keep whether Mina is the queen or the princess consistent. These are not interchangeable terms. They also switch between her as a student and as the school's chairman.  Her physical abilities also fluctuate. There are times when she can fight well and others where she's completely helpless because the plot needs her to be rescued. It's like she's silver age Jimmy Olsen and just constantly has different abilities. The romance is pretty dreadful in this as well. The 'development' is really stilted and comes across as contrived. But that isn't the worst part of it. You find out that she's been basically obsessed with him since he was a small child. That's the plot line with the paedophile werewolf from Twilight levels of just wrong. They try to balance it by making her look prepubescent but that just makes it worse. Or maybe it's less about balance and more that the writer has a fetish for children and should probably be institutionalised. Even the major side romance is utterly horrendous garbage involving one character who's way too old for the other, but with a less extreme age difference. The narrative isn't particularly compelling either. While it has some concepts that could be interesting if they were expanded on, it's more interested in showcasing its terrible romance and in providing fan-service. Because the only class that this writer is aware of is the variety you attend.That being said, the whole idea of vampire society revealing itself and integrating into human society could have been really interesting if the writing hadn't been complete schlock. The whole Dance With the Vampire Maids segment can be kind of funny at times too.Characters:For the most part, the characters aren't all that bad. They're mostly just dull. There are two issues that really demote them from mediocrity. The first is the incessantly obnoxious way that a bunch of the female characters pursue our boring hero. The second is that the character dynamics are weak and they suffer from the same lack of cohesion as the narrative, undergoing changes without any reason beyond the plot demands it.Art:Dance in the Vampire  Bund may very well be worse than Strike Witches when it comes to ridiculous, excess levels of fan-service. The big reason being that most of it centres around Mina, a character who looks to be eight or nine. She looks younger than Lucchini Here's the thing about Mina. You could potentially make me believe that our bland hero could fall for her, in spite of her appearance, since she doesn't act like a child, for the most part. It would require considerably better writing, but you could manage that. However, you aren't going to convince me that you're showing 'sexy' scenes of her starkers for any reason beyond you being a total sleazy scum bag. We don't need to see her in the nude for the narrative it's just distracting and unpleasant. Because she looks to be eight or nine. The action sequences are pretty bad too. Most of them consist of seeing our protagonist take a couple hits and then end things with one attack. Good thing  his opponents have no durability. If they were evenly matched on that front he'd have been killed pretty much right away and the series would be somewhat better because it wouldn't have its lousy romance taking up a bunch of time.Sound:The series got some good actors. Saito Chiwa, Yuuki Aoi & Itou Shizuka to name a few. Their performances in this, however, are pretty weak. You can tell they're trying but the writing just doesn't give them much in terms of character complexity. The music isn't bad, but it is pretty weak.Ho-yay:The series doesn't have any. Which is fine by me given that its romance is at the Twilight level.Final Thoughts:So, that's Dance in the Vampire Bund. How ungood is “not very good?” Well, the premise had potential and there are some funny bits in the ending segments but its held back by an awful romance, a story that doesn't hold together well, absurd levels of fan-service (a lot of which involves a character who looks like she's eight), weak performances and bland characters.

Next week I'll look at Natsume Yuujinchou."", ""Due to the overwhelming amount of negativity in this anime i decided to write this review.Dance in the Vampire Bund was an anime that caught my attention completely by accident stumbling on a video while exploring the internet. I was immediately immersed within the story. While yes the main plot behind the anime, (boy loses memory, cant remember girl/ promise with girl, goes through adventure to regain memory) is a bit cliche and the whole amnesia thing is truly overused but the story and presentation of this is truly magnificent.Akira the main character  initially has a cases of memory loss when Mina The...Queen of the Vampires, rediscovers him after a long absence. At the same time Mina is making the existence of Vampires public. What ensues is a mixture of the occult, graphic violence, political entanglement, struggling with oneself, and romance.Now Dance in the Vampire Bund is not without its own faults, the story seems to be choppy, and not entirely planned out as well as the complete open ended way that the final episode ends, begging for a second season. Despite this, the story will always have you asking questions all the way to the end with very dramatic and interesting ways to answer each and every one of them. The art of the anime was beautifully done, many panoramic scenes, and stunning visuals.. this is a dark anime, somehow though they don't overuse this aspect so the anime still seems light and in some areas cheery.Changing the subject a bit,while i dissagree with many other people on this anime one thing t i can agree with other reviewers is why? It seems there are no reasons in the beginning as to why Akira does anything at all, changing from ignoring her, to helping her, to ignoring her again, then fighting against her, to once again being at her side. I believe this has to do with how he is gaining his memories back, but this wasn't truly evident in the anime.All in all though this anime does a wonderful job at what anime should do which is entertain. Queen of the Vampires, rediscovers him after a long absence. At the same time Mina is making the existence of Vampires public.

In my opinion, it\'s better than Bakemonogatari, another SHAFT production directed by Akiyuki Shinbo. You should know that Shinbo is quite an auteur. His shows are positively smeared with his unique timbre. If you don\'t like other works from Shinbo, you won\'t like this one either. This show is directed intelligently schizophrenic: zoom, cut, still frame, cut, blur, cut, shot of seemingly unrelated object/scene, cut, dialogue, cut, wide-screen, inverted colors, etc. Despite all this, it\'s not confusing. Instead, it\'s exhilarating. Staccato. Fast. MTV on speed. Never boring.""Intelligently"" schizophrenic, because none of the cuts are actually random. Every movement has...a purpose, not a wasted note is to be found. Sometimes, just when the dissonant camerawork and cut scenes seem about to overpower, it resolves into a beautifully harmonic scene. Sometimes the artwork is truly beautiful, like the shock-waves through flowers (cleomes, which only bloom at night)in the opening, and sometimes it\'s twisted, like a few of the vampires\' true forms.It may be avant garde, but it is by no means pretentious. Rather, it is a drunken romp flavored with gore, eroticism, dry humor, and pulp. It starts off sober enough, as most drunken romps do, but, well, you know how those Friday nights go… By the end, it sobers up into a pretty love ballad, and finishes quite touchingly with an epic and emotional finale.It\'s often hard to tell if the story\'s continuous or not. Just as distortion allows a punk rocker to hide wrong notes and sloppy technique, the mania of this show obscures its sanity. When the show hits a sober note, it is ofter startling. One particularly delightful moment in the story was the parable of the butterfly and the flower who looked like a butterfly. The butterfly tries desperately to court the still flower, who never responds to him. As one of my favorite characters says, ""no matter how strongly the butterfly feels, he will never be together with a flower."" The music this series dances to is the weakest link. Even so, it is delightfully gothic during the episode, pretty and energized before, and raunchy after.I thought this would be a controversial review considering the negativity this show has gotten here, so I checked the ratings distribution over at animenewsnetwork. This show is considered ""very good"" by a strong mode, though the average is drawn lower by a minority who find the show to be ""worst ever"". This means the people who dislike it are the most vociferous, not the most representative. What I\'m getting at is that you, dear reader, shouldn\'t be scared away by the negative reviews.Here\'s a guide to see if you like it: 1. Did you like the manga if you read it? As far as I know, everyone who was a fan of the manga hated the show. You might be the exception, but not likely. 2. Do you like SHAFT? If so, then you have a greater chance of liking this release. 3. Do you pick up on dry humor? Almost every anime I\'ve seen that\'s not a comedy or pretentious ""art"" (such as haibanme renmei) has some level of dry humor. If you don\'t really pick up on that stuff, a lot of this will seem boring to you. 4. Can you tolerate inappropriate fan service? Our 100 year old protagonist has the body of a ten year old, but definitely has tendencies belonging to much older females. 5. Watch the first episode. If you are one of the few who liked the first episode, then you are most likely going to enjoy the rest of the series.

The author is Tamaki Nozomu,well known for his ecchi and hentai mangas, so we didn\'t expect too much from him either way.In this anime we have a blonde moe prepubescent girl (most likely twelve years old) that never ages. We also have the bishōnen Akira Kaburagi Regendorf (the first two names are japanese ,but the etymology of the last name is a little complex,""Rege"" means  in romanian ""king"", but I\'m not sure if the...mangaka named him knowing this detail). As for Mina Ţepeş\'s name,her family name is derived from the Vlad Ţepeş (meaning Vlad The Impaler) also known by the surname Dracul or later ""Dracula"". Vlad was referred to in several documents as ""Dracul"", which  means ""Son of the dragon"" and points to his fatherl, who received that moniker from his subjects because he had joined the Order of the Dragon. Dracul, derived from the Latin word Draco meant ""dragon"", though in modern Romanian it means ""devil"".Now, returning to the story... The anime introduces the viewer to the main characters, Mina ( the above mentionated loli vampire ), and the  bishōnen Akira , which is later revealed to be  a werewolf ( love between a vampire,how original ). Akira-kun is the knight in shiney armor that wants to protect his lady ( Mina ) and rescue her. The intial story line shouldn\'t be taken so serious,since it is more of satire/parody of what modern japanese people about vampires, attributing many distorted concepts. Therefore,alternating the mythology in order to appeal to the modern audience.  Per total the story wasn\'t meant to be a deep,complex and emotional story full of unexpected story twits, but more of a parody. Therefore  the story seems constrained  to take a serious turn,and even when it finally does it feels out of place and clumsy. This anime achieves more being a comedy/satire than it achieves being dramatic.Story: 3•    I\'ve always liked and admired SHAFT for the excelent animation and art, because of the master pieces animes such as Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Kino\'s Journey: The Land of Sickness -For You-, Maria†Holic ,Bakemonogatari etc.  I can\'t say that I don\'t enjoy this anime\'s graphic same as the others,that would be a lie. It has good animation,interesting visual effects and innovative visual concepts. However, the story drags down the art,with its clichés and  fanservice, especially from a loli exchibitionist like Mina. The fights scenes are decent,verging on average ...Art: 6•    The music was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.The Opening Theme  Friends by Aiko Nakano and Ending Theme  Tsumeato by Hibiku were fine,and agreable but nothing surprising,interesting and kind of wanna be a deep song or something like that.I liked it,but they are far from being my favorite japanese songs.Sound: 7•    The characters may seem at first glance  full of clichés. Their personality  may seem apathetic , even when they face situations of emotional intensity. That may be because the mangaka focused more on the superfical aspects of the characters, and less about their inner selves.However,as the story progresses, the characters seem to gain more substance,being more believable in the interactions with each other. The  character that I empathize/symphatize most with  is Akira, he is just a normal teenager surrounded by unusual circumstances. And never forget: A single word:FANSERVICE. A lot of fanservice, especially loli fanservice. They don\'t really have a role or any purpose whatsoever, the complexity of one\'s character is not that important.Added:Watching more episodes, I realised the characters do have some development. However, the characters remain the weakest point in the anime.Characters: 3•    I really do hope that this anime will have in the future a more serious plot, and that the mangaka will be more serious about it, after all, it\'s offensive to us readers.The idea was quite interesting and it could be a lot better and complex, but it turned out to be quite  clichéic story. I really hoped for more...Enjoyment: 3Overall: 4Note: I have made a review of this anime back in 2010, when the first episodes appeared. At the time I was angered by the lack of historical knowlege that made people misunderstand a few things about the vampire concept. However, as of 22.02.2013, I changed my review and ratings, toning it down, and presenting the anime in a more favorable light, without being blinded by subjectivism. mangaka named him knowing this detail). As for Mina Ţepeş\'s name,her family name is derived from the Vlad Ţepeş (meaning Vlad The Impaler) also known by the surname Dracul or later ""Dracula"". Vlad was referred to in several documents as ""Dracul"", which  means ""Son of the dragon"" and points to his fatherl, who received that moniker from his subjects because he had joined the Order of the Dragon. Dracul, derived from the Latin word Draco meant ""dragon"", though in modern Romanian it means ""devil"".Now, returning to the story... The anime introduces the viewer to the main characters, Mina ( the above mentionated loli vampire ), and the  bishōnen Akira , which is later revealed to be  a werewolf ( love between a vampire,how original ). Akira-kun is the knight in shiney armor that wants to protect his lady ( Mina ) and rescue her. The intial story line shouldn\'t be taken so serious,since it is more of satire/parody of what modern japanese people about vampires, attributing many distorted concepts. Therefore,alternating the mythology in order to appeal to the modern audience.  Per total the story wasn\'t meant to be a deep,complex and emotional story full of unexpected story twits, but more of a parody. Therefore  the story seems constrained  to take a serious turn,and even when it finally does it feels out of place and clumsy. This anime achieves more being a comedy/satire than it achieves being dramatic.Story: 3•    I\'ve always liked and admired SHAFT for the excelent animation and art, because of the master pieces animes such as Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Kino\'s Journey: The Land of Sickness -For You-, Maria†Holic ,Bakemonogatari etc.  I can\'t say that I don\'t enjoy this anime\'s graphic same as the others,that would be a lie. It has good animation,interesting visual effects and innovative visual concepts. However, the story drags down the art,with its clichés and  fanservice, especially from a loli exchibitionist like Mina. The fights scenes are decent,verging on average ...Art: 6•    The music was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.The Opening Theme  Friends by Aiko Nakano and Ending Theme  Tsumeato by Hibiku were fine,and agreable but nothing surprising,interesting and kind of wanna be a deep song or something like that.I liked it,but they are far from being my favorite japanese songs.Sound: 7•    The characters may seem at first glance  full of clichés. Their personality  may seem apathetic , even when they face situations of emotional intensity. That may be because the mangaka focused more on the superfical aspects of the characters, and less about their inner selves.However,as the story progresses, the characters seem to gain more substance,being more believable in the interactions with each other. The  character that I empathize/symphatize most with  is Akira, he is just a normal teenager surrounded by unusual circumstances. And never forget: A single word:FANSERVICE. A lot of fanservice, especially loli fanservice. They don\'t really have a role or any purpose whatsoever, the complexity of one\'s character is not that important.Added:Watching more episodes, I realised the characters do have some development. However, the characters remain the weakest point in the anime.Characters: 3•    I really do hope that this anime will have in the future a more serious plot, and that the mangaka will be more serious about it, after all, it\'s offensive to us readers.The idea was quite interesting and it could be a lot better and complex, but it turned out to be quite  clichéic story. I really hoped for more...Enjoyment: 3Overall: 4Note: I have made a review of this anime back in 2010, when the first episodes appeared.

Well at least I hope so, and I really hope that there will be a second season. Well, yes I've read the manga and seen the Anime... But I don't want to compare it... I'll just write a review for the Anime as it is:Do you remember Hellsing? Yeah, cool guy with cool sunglasses, and a gun which is taller than the one of Vash the Stampede... That's what a true Vampire-King is about!... Well, let's summarize the Vampire-Queen from DitVB: A cute little Lolicon-princess, when...you see her you would like to hug her and pat on her head... Cute little girley! Oh well... Yes she looks as terrifying as a poring (Small pink enemy ball in Ragnarok Online)... Well... But, even if the first few episodes of this don't show the real intentions and character of Mina, she can be quite hardcore... Well in fact the characters are good as they are. I like them! I like hime, Akira, the dumb glassed megaboob president pedo girl who loves her little brother, yeah and even yuki, who is the normal girl in this anime... Yeah... They are nothing special, nothing new, but all the categories are there. So everyone should be happy...Well if I were to rate the first few episodes, this anime would have a score about mh 4 or so. I read the manga after I watched the anime. So I was confused sometimes about the scenes, there were holes in the storyline and somehow it seemed cutted... Hm, but after a while it got better, you get to know more about the characters and the bund... You'll learn a few secrets, you get to see some action, some moe and some ecchi... Well, in fact I don't give such a high score for an serious anime... No it's a high score for a lightweight anime. Yeah, you can search for a deeper meaning, and you'll even find it. Yes, you can read the manga and the story'll develop in a much clearer and more interessting way... But oh well let's write a fazit:If you want to watch a good Anime with some weaknesses, but a lot of entertaining scenes: like action, romance, ecchi and so on... Hey it's ok watch DitVB. If you don't take it to serious it's a very good anime. Else read the Manga, but I belive if you don't like the Anime you won't hype the Manga as well. you see her you would like to hug her and pat on her head... Cute little girley! Oh well...

However, the anime storyline lacks very important information. We the viewers are constantly wondering why something happens when it does which I personally found VERY frustrating.Not to mention the ending where we're all left hanging...which I hated because now we have to wait to see if they make a sequel so we can find out what the hell really happened.Art:The animation in this anime was fantastic! Shaft really did a good job of...making everything so life-like and realistic. My favorite part is where the camera moves up and gives a full range of the body of the character and then focuses on the eyes that are obviously a personal touch done by Shaft.Sound:The opening to the anime was well to put it in simply boring. It did not really suit the mood of the story at all.However, I personally liked the closing to the anime. It is not something amazing but it does provided a simple yet catchy ending song to the anime.The background is excellent you can hear every sound.The voice actors are well fitted to their characters in a way that you cannot imagine anyone else voicing them.Characters:While most of the characters are...with lack of a better word their stereotypical.Mina is the only one who shows more depth with her sarcasm and all mighty personality.Although I personally did like the anime only character Mei Rin, the cracking sound when she bites hard candy just gives me a chill. She is a bit too forward with Akira but I personally found it funny how she constantly tried to make him uncomfortable.Enjoyment:I received much pleasure from this anime. Although lacking in storyline and in depth of the characters. This anime kept me on my toes, it kept me wanting to know more. I watched each episode trying to figure out what was going to happen only for the episode to end in a way I did not expect which was thrilling but also a little frustrating at times.Overall:Overall I would rate this anime a 10 just because of my personally enjoyment. Nevertheless, for the sake of other people who do not quite share the same opinion I would rate this anime a 7.You might not like this anime if you hate vampires or werewolves.It has many political things, which I know a lot of you readers find to be boring.There is some blood and gore so if you are not into that then you should probably avoid this anime.If you are super into sugary sweet romance then you are not going to like this anime, however if you like the whole forbidden love thing then this anime is for you.Now this is my personal opinion and I am not forcing any of you to share it. making everything so life-like and realistic.

I mean the reason we watch anime is to escape boredem right and yes this helped me out on that.Now I don't want to talk about any major spoiler and seeing as I just finished the anime my memory of it is quite sharp. So lets see well I learned that unlike many other series which have 12 episodes which is consisted of one arc this has 2 arcs each has 6 episodes which was a nice turn of events. So from that I can tell you that this is indeed a fast paced anime with a epic if not amazing story which makes you think of vampires in a different manner.Now the art hhhmmmmnnnnn well have you ever watched the monogatari series if not watch it cause they are quite similar in terms of one of the main protagonist being a vampire. Well the animation used is quite decent I haven't read the manga so I couldn't give you the a proper description of whether or not the art work is similar as I have not seen a lot if  it my self. but never the less in the anime its is quite decent and the flow of animation is smooth in nearly all scenes there are one or two scenes which could have been animated better but hey it look awesome overall any-ways so you know i bet you guys wont event notice it the only reason I noticed it cause I tend to be very observant when it comes to watch an interesting anime.The characters now here is an interesting topic vampire + wearworlves cleache much. I said and done a thousand times in countless novels but in all honesty this is my first anime in which this has actually happened. So in term of anime i think this is an original love between 2 different character of different races. one of the things i like abut this is this anime has got character development if anything else.I want to write ssssooo much more but anymore and I will probably will be spoiling it for all of you and considering it has very short arcs any-ways then what's the point in watch if you know what is gona happen so thanks for reading pls watch and enjoy this anime. entertainment it has provided me a sufficient amount.

and the root of this popular and discussed genre.So,obviously,I searched on google.Learned a little about Vlad the impaler.So,afterward,as I got the basic idea,I intended to watch some anime series about vampire.Despite of some people\'s opinion,I do not think that vampire stories in anime is bad.In most of the cases,the storyteller uses his imagination and makes a vampire which have superpowers or they don\'t have to bite or they don\'t get burned in the sun etc.So,yes,This show is no difference.But among the vampire...anime out there,this one should be kept on top of the list.I can assure you,this show is worth watching.Only 12 episodes,aired in 2010.Produced by Shaft,Genco,AT-X and flying dog etc.This anime was licensed by FUNimation and later on it got  dubbed .So,obviously I watched the dubbed version and no complain there.But on youtube,the dubbed version you\'ll get is actually fandubbed.So better not to mix up.Synopsis:Right at the very beginning,the viewers didn\'t get any idea how this series supposed to get.It all started within a television show about the existence of vampires.Where several people related to the topic were invited.And at some point,a beautiful lady was introduced and she claimed herself to be a vampire.That\'s the moment where everything started to get messed up.A little girl from the audience,Mina Tepes,made a drastic move creating an intense situation.At the end of the 1st episode,things got hung in a very bizarre situation.Afterwards,the story moved on quite fast.A regular school boy named Akira was introduced to the show.But just like other stories,he has a mysterious past and identity.And apparently,we learned that Mina Tepes the main character of the series,has a rational goal for both draculas and mankind.Among the few things, I loved the pacing of this show.It brought up incidents that were supposed to happen in that time of the storyline.Theme Setup,Music & Artwork:I just loved the direction.The theme was deliciously dark as a horror show supposed to be.The time setting was present japan.But the churches,building structures and the other enviroment mixed up perfectly to give you a majestic experience.Moving on to the music,I can\'t recall any track from the ost.Doesn\'t mean that it was bad,it was decent in my opinion.The opening and ending tracks are the same,they just got turned over in the halfway of the series.I liked them both.One is called ""Friends"" and the other one is titled as ""Tsumeato"".Proceeding,the artwork was perfect.You are supposed to love the glossy effects.Every character looked charming.And one thing I would like to mention is that the aspect ratio changed depending on the mood of the situation.May seem trivial,but it made the scenes even more dramatic.And about the animation,I would say that it was crafted as smooth as the artwork.Characters Setup:First of all,Mina Tepes,the Vampire disguised as a little girl.She is the princess of the ancient covenant and ruler of all vampires.She is the strong female protagonist you ought to like.As she holds the throne,she makes the most tactical decisions and can manipulate her co-workers well.Moving on to Akira,he is the of strong and devoted character,which can be seen very regularly in lots of anime.At the beginning we learned that he lost his memories by an accident.And afterward,he gains his memory back.And meanwhile in the process,he got enough character development.Moving on,there was a girl named Yuki we saw from the beginning.She loves Akira,but as usually, there are complexity.She got enough screentime.And sometimes she acted as a narrator.So basically,they are the main characters of the show.As for supporting,Nella,Nelly and Vera were at the side of Mina.From the school,Nanami had some more story.Hikosaka,Kuje and Takashi were used to be Akira\'s friend.And as a teacher,sister Laura gave us the general idea of the institution.Beside that,as the story progressed,bunch of the other characters came in from the ancient vampire monarchy,the government and etc.Overall Rating:MAL Rating: 7.25My Rating: 9.0 anime out there,this one should be kept on top of the list.I can assure

bulid a home for the vampire race,akira kaburagi must keep his childhood promise to protect her from those who would dethrone her.i really like anime because its a great story.there are some pretty good fighting scenes and its also a great conspiracy-like anime ', ""A fan of Twilight? Vampires? Werewolves? Fantasy? This anime has it all. Dance in the Vampire Bund was previously adapted from the manga and consists 12 episodes with 1 recap. A highly suspenseful and mysterious source. I personally thought everything was thorough, and detailed. If you're interested in a fantasy, horror, slight bit of nudity, this is a perfect anime for you.Story: 10The story was very well thought. The audience clearly understands what is going on and the plot doesn't skip all over the place, definitely have transitional scenes in between. The future scenes were somewhat predictable in some areas. There were 3 different stories...that connected and the 2nd scenario were fairly predictable, but otherwise i thought the plot was interesting. The plot really stood out, it wasn't those typical romances with your typical daily lives. Really is unique compared to the rest, especially when both protagonists start to reveal their past to the audienceArt: 10The art was very detailed, indeed. The contrast in black and red, against the bright yellow and white portrays a very evil aspect of the anime, yet the brighter colours kind of portray a type of hope and peace. Although most of the anime was set in the dark you can distinguish the many aspects of the animation. It also had  great effects, especially with the vampire attacks and transformations.Sound:Similar to the art in the movie, it was well used at the right times. When you hear the sounds you can feel the different emotions in it, for example, if one would scream, it'd give a really eerie feel and send goosebumps up your spine. Its as if the sound runs through your body giving you the right reaction to the event that is occurring. Truly astounding.Characters:The characters were well developed. It was brought with a third person omniscient view, in which we know some things that are only revealed to the audience but not the actual characters in the story. The characters were very mysterious in every concept, you don't know some of their motives, etc. But as the anime progresses, the anime unfolds and many would start to understand the character's motive and personality better. The one thing I wasn't so pleased about was the nudity of the Vampire Queen (who has taken form into a young blond child), it was....rather disturbing. However, after awhile it'll be easily to absorb those images. Akira's personality was a little too obvious, really, a typical hero, who tries to keep his promise and does anything to save his friends, and Queen.I absolutely enjoyed the anime and I hope you will too =] that connected and the 2nd scenario were fairly predictable, but otherwise i thought the plot was interesting.

This series however, made me fall more in love with series that deal with the Vampires and other supernatural creatures. Something that bugged me was the low rating this seemed to have, naturally an anime that I enjoyed I wanted to write a positive review. So let\'s get started shall we?Story: 8/10The premise of the story deals with the Queen of Vampires, Mina Tepes, and the promise 10 years before the current setting made with the main protagonist Kaburagi Akira. ""The Queen who had all the power, and boy who offered her everything."" Or...something like that was the reason this whole story had happened. The two\'s promise was that Akira would never leave her side, and he\'ll always have her smile. A little cliche\'d but I didn\'t mind. Now I would have given the story a 10/10 if the plot gave more detail about Mina and the Japanese government. This also dealt with politics, knowing the Japanese were in a huge debt, along with the Bund the queen created to support all the vampires. Sadly they didn\'t provide much detail, but all in all the story was done quite well.Art: 10/10From the get go, I knew the art was done by Shaft, the animators of the Bake and Nisemonogatari. From the odd viewpoints to the realistic characters. What I mean is that the characters anatomy was done closely to realistic ones, unlike those big eye\'d stereotypical type of characters. This is what I really enjoyed. Another was the beauty of mixing real pictures along with the anime. Shaft has an unorthodox way of animating things, something that really catches my eye.Sound: 9/10The sound was a bit out of the ordinary but not something over the top. The soundtracks played during key moments and the tone fit it as well. Opening and ending songs were something to remember, that also kept me on the positive side of the Sound portion.Character: 10/10Primarily, the story mainly focused on the two, Mina Tepes and Kaburagi Akira. The growth the characters have were amazing, the development was much needed for the story and they were done right. Although some side characters stand out, not much development but still important to the story.Overall: 9/10For me, I would\'ve gave it a 10/10 but I tried my best to be unbiased for this review. I really enjoyed Dance in the Vampire Bund. I suggest for fans of any supernatural creature fans, romance fans, and action, this is something for you. If not, I highly suggest you try this, you may enjoy this as well :) something like that was the reason this whole story had happened.

If not, I highly suggest you try this, you may enjoy this as well :)', ""I've seen mixed reviews for this anime. Some good, some bad and some average. I must say I rather enjoyed this show. Interesting story and world. The setting and animation were also very good.Some criticisms are it was a bit rushed as they tended to include a lot going on at the same time and it could have done with being longer in order for it to improve.The best part of the anime by far was Mina Tepes. She is the main reason I really wanted to see this anime and she is a really cute and great character. I often like vampire...lolis in general so I definitely felt quite optimistic about her right from the start.Warning ⛔️ ⚠️ There is some Loli fan service (even though she’s hundreds of years old she has quite a childlike appearance) which may get a bit uncomfortable but there isn’t too much. lolis in general so I definitely felt quite optimistic about her right from the start.Warning ⛔️ ⚠️ There is some Loli fan service (even though she’s hundreds of years old she has quite a childlike appearance) which may get a bit uncomfortable but there isn’t too much."", ""I don't know where to begin with this episode, I see a lot of reviews going over every aspect of the show in great detail but with this anime I can only say 1 thing about it..... It's extremely unique. I have not seen very many animes that actually hit me like this one did, though i'm starting to think i'm just a sucker for a bit of a romance :).I've seen a few vampire animes out there and I can say this indefinitely, this is the best one to date. The romance was amazing, the battle's were epic and the drama was unlike anything...i've seen!!I don't think there are true words to describe this anime other then, I fell in love with this anime within a matter of minutes of watching the first episode. Most romance shows you can usually predict what will happen next but this will is a whole nother ball park.

Now most people watched it for the sexy loli vamp queen, (not going to lie..... i didn\'t mind it) but that\'s not what made it so good. For start it\'s different to the manga in many many ways, but i feel like if they didn\'t change it the way they did it wouldn\'t of been as good (for the anime). Like there are only two races not 4 - 6 and the main hero didn\'t loose his memory he knew from the start that he was a wolf ( ill stop...it there cause there is alot more). Second the love story and the way it made you feel each step of the way was bloody well done for a 12 ep series. Action was good for what we saw and the blood matched it just right and not over kill (like some i have seen).The only bad bit is that it didn\'t get anything after. No move, ova mini series... nothing.

It is one of the best vampire animes ever, and while most animes you see people bitching saying the manga was better, in this case, while the manga was longer and has a longer story (and more completed for that matter), but with this anime, the anime was better than the manga, its just a shame that a season 2 didn't come out to finish the story. Love the anime. 10/10. I liked this anime as it has many things other animes even fail to...do now.

I have a small feeling it’s a mix between ‘Black Blood Brothers’ and ‘Moon Phase’ where it’s a cutesy Lolita girl but is creating a new area for Vampires. I’m not so sure how I feel about Werewolves being controlled by Vampires. To me, they should be on the same level like all the other story lines but I guess it fits the story line. Akira feels a lot like Kouhei from Moon Phase and I would probably say they...were the same person if it wasn’t for the fact that he isn’t a real weakling. Another thing that makes it odd is that Akira’s friend talks a lot throughout the story as though she isn’t in the show much.The artwork is bright and crisp, though I feel it should have been a little darker. It’s rather high detailed in some places but then turns into action lines and crazy CG artwork in a couple parts. This is the really sad CG that doesn’t look right in the show. It’s also the fact that the parts they have CG could have been really easily created by drawing. The beginning is pretty interesting though the running around gets really old really fast. I’m also not found of the naked Lolita. It’s more fan service that isn’t needed. There is also way to many images of flowers when there not part of the show.The music is really not that special.

Some scenes in the earlier episodes almost looks...like you were meant to watch them through a pair of 3D glasses due to how some colors seem to blend in with the surroundings.Sound: 8/10 - It\'s not bad, but not amazing either.Story/Character: 8/10 - This is the most tricky part for me to rate due to the introduction of anime-only characters and other ones being skimmed over. The voice actors captured the characters perfectly no doubt about it. Only reason I\'m not giving this a 10, is due to Meiren, the anime-only character that gets the most screentime. While her character is played out great she is introduced early in the series as a means of fleshing out Akira\'s character due to his anime-only amnesia plot and in the end replaces another very important character from the manga which would\'ve been introduced around episode 11.While I\'m disappointed they altered the story somewhat from the manga in order to make the first 32 chapters fit neatly into a 12-ep show, it still holds up on its own without shifting too far away from the more critical plot points, this portrayal even ends up more clearly explaining a few vague things from the manga even if it instead removed a bit of suspense by introducing a certain character too early. It still doesn\'t tell the full story which continues for another 35 chapters after the anime ends, if the anime has tickled your fancies I recommend reading the manga to get the full unedited version.Enjoyment: 9/10 - Giving it a 10 is something I would\'ve done simply because I could not put it down and ended up marathoning it, I can\'t do this due to my issues with the characters and story though.

While these developments take place, Mina and Akira do come at odds with human and vampire terrorists attempting to interfere with Mina’s plans at coexistence between vampires and humans.Before I comment on other stuff with...Vampire Bund, I suppose I need to address the elephant in the room in regards to its controversial content regarding the sexualization of Mina. While Mina is a centuries-old vampire, she normally takes on the form of a prepubescent girl. While there are plot reasons for her to take this form that are revealed later in the series, Vampire Bund does often sexualize her for fan service shots as she can be seen nude or in states of undress at a number of points in the series and she usually teases Akira while in her nubile form to his annoyance. A fun fact with all this is that Funimation, the anime’s American licensor, had originally planned to release a censored version of the series to home video due to concerns with its lolicon content, before negative fan outcry led them to change their stance and release the series unedited in America. Outside of this, the anime also explores a shotacon relationship as a secondary female character in the series has an attraction to a prepubescent boy she babysits. With all this touchy content, I certainly wouldn’t recommend younger and more sensitive audiences to dabble into Vampire Bund and I will personally admit I was often uneasy whenever the series chose to sexualize Mina.Putting aside that touchy baggage, the main attraction to Vampire Bund comes in the form of Mina’s character. Outside of the series sexualizing her, she is portrayed as being hardened, authoritative, and usually ruthless when engaging in affairs to either aid her kind or mercilessly dispatch those that threaten relations between humanity and vampires. At the same time though, witnessing the touchy relations between humanity and vampires has worn on her and she comes to appreciate her bond with Akira as one of the few parts of normalcy she can have in her life away from serving as her kind’s ruler. Having these facets to her character makes witnessing Mina’s developments engaging to see and give her both strong and sympathetic traits that give her a solid amount of dimension.In addition, the series does offer some interesting takes on typical vampire lore. Some traditional elements are retained such as their vulnerability to sunlight, connections to Vlad Tepes, a vampire class system, and being served by were-creatures. However, vampires in Vampire Bund are not vulnerable to other traditional weaknesses like garlic and holy symbols, nor are able to command bats. Unique takes on vampires offered in the series include a class of fangless vampires who willingly removed their fangs and the idea that a vampire’s true form varies on the type of character they have. Plus, vampires within the series are shown to employ modern technology to their advantage in varying capacities such as creating a serum that can reverse vampirism in humans recently bitten, a special lotion that grants vampires temporary resistance to sunlight, and a chemical that interacts with vampire blood that makes vampires into suicidal bombers.As far as other story and character elements go within Vampire Bund, they are a bit of a mixed bag. Other characters lack the dimension given to Mina as many simply fill specific character types and roles given to them. The series attempts to give Akira depth as he is shown to be trying to recover parts of his memory lost before the start of the series, though he otherwise mostly fills the “nice guy” character type willingly serving under Mina. Beyond serving as a human observer to Mina and Akira’s bond, Yuki has little else that sticks out as a character. The student council president and Mei Ran have some interesting personalities or developments, but lack the screen time to make too much of an impact on the series as a whole.As far as the story goes, Vampire Bund is divided up into several story arcs that go into Mina establishing her bund for vampires, dealing with a vampire terrorist group set on threatening her goals, and dealing with a trio of vampire nobles. The plot is pretty straightforward as far as developments go as they serve to challenge Mina and her allies with handling humanity’s prejudices, the vampire terrorists, and the trio of nobles in question. However like many anime based on ongoing manga titles, the series does end inconclusively as there are several lingering plot elements left unanswered that include the motives of the mysterious vampire terrorist organization and the secrets of the vampire “true blood legacy”.Visually, Shaft was at the helm with animating this adaptation of Dance in the Vampire Bund. Character designs were given a good deal of visual detail and does have show a wide range of facial expressions and clothes with characters, most notably Mina who has plenty of clothes she is shown to wear throughout the series and showing the widest range of expressions due to the dimension of her character. The series does play around with a number of visual gimmicks to get around lack of regular fluid animation such as flashes between animated frames, close shots on certain body parts like legs and lips, or transitions between camera shots and perspectives. The results of this are hit-or-miss as instances of this are effective at conveying perspectives between characters during conversations and key scenes, while others appear to be stylistic choices to attempt having the series stick out yet being more a distraction than enhancing the viewing experience of the series in any way.Overall, I’d suppose Dance in the Vampire Bund is a mixed bag for me. While Mina is an engaging character with the amount of dimension she has and the series lore offers some different takes on traditional vampire lore, many of the other characters lack the presence that Mina brings to the series and the plot is pretty standard fare as far as developments go. Not to mention the ecchi and lolicon content offered up with the series is likely to turn away many fans from considering even seeing it. In short, your mileage will definitely vary with how well you regard this series.

The artwork is awesome and so are the characters.  The plot is always moving around from one side of the story to the other, and oh ya, it has vampires in it which makes it all the more fun to watch.  There is never a dull moment with this anime so I would definately recommend it to anyone over 18.  Other than that, enjoy. ', ""The manga and anime have some differences, but they both have good story. First I watched anime which left me with mixed feelings. The storytelling was very good and story itself was interesting and had complex main characters. But there were some unexplained moments which left me confused. Many details from “Dance in Vampire Bund” manga didn’t get in anime adaptation, so I advise you to read it first. This is the last time I talk about manga and all further words will be only about my impression from this anime.On first glance “Dance in Vampire Bund” may seem like another story focusing on vampire...theme, but there are other themes beside it. Maybe the main plot is revolving around Vampire Princess and the most of characters is supernatural creatures, but more important is how they treat each other and their relationships with humans. Discrimination of some supernatural creatures, the weight of ruling the entire nation, hard decisions for the sake of many “people”, relationship issues – those are the main themes of this anime. And all that is showed not only in conversations – which is great disadvantage of all animes trying to be serious – but in characters actions. This is making the story really awesome and interesting. I just want more anime with this trait but dreams, dreams, dreams…One more thing about the story: it envelopes in a form of detective, but there aren’t really surprising plot twists.  It’s just moving force for the main plot and shouldn’t get much of your attention. The main genre here is still drama although it may appear something else in the beginning. And by the way, the first episode is just introduction to the setting, so don’t judge the whole season by it. If you are bored with it just skip to second episode – you wouldn’t lose too much.Art is normal most of the time, but there are silly looking echi moments which just doesn't seem to fit the story. I even don’t know if it’s some kind of bad fun service or just making the anime less serious.The music is good, but it is mostly the same. Good for anime soundtrack, but I don’t have any particular melody which I liked. So I don’t see any reason to download soundtrack – music seems good only when you watching anime.So, in sum, I enjoyed the anime. It could be better and more elaborating, but even with its flaws “Dance in Vampire Bund” is one of anime with really good story. theme, but there are other themes beside it.

Which doesn't make sense, since the manga itself has characters and a plot that you would think would need very little change to be successful. BOY WAS I WRONG.

It's not a typical anime. Once you get into it I couldn't stop watching. I fell in love with the main characters and their stories. Some scenes might be weird, but every anime is weird time to time.

Overall great vampire anime! A little dark, but to be expected.P.S. There's room for a season 2 hopefully they make...one! one!"", 'Vampires. The genre feels very divided - either people love it or hate it. I´m personally are quite fascinated by vampires and vampire story´s, it´s something with these children of the dark that never grows old on me - their wildness, immortality, history, powers, weaknesses, and bloodsucking can be decpited in so many ways. As to date not so many great vampire stories has been adapted to anime compared to other genres such as shounen, shoujo, harems, demons and so on. Of course some really great ones has been adapted such as Hellsing Ultimate, Blood+, and Trinity Blood with varying results. So I was quite...happy with how satisfied I was after finishing ""Dance in the Vampire Bund"" (DITVB). It took the theme seriously and didn´t lay any fingers in between. I will elaborate why think this is a gem for all you out there that has the slightest interest in vampires stories.Story: 8/10After millennium in hiding the vampire race chooses to out them self to the world in the attempts to create their own free state within Japanese boarders, lead by their ruler princess Mina Tepes - direct dicendent of Vlad Tepes (Dracula). Of course this isn´t welcomed by all, both humans and other vampires. Especially not since rouge vampires are attacking humans and by doing so turing them. Mina and her allies goal is to coexist with the humans on their secluded island - which are called the vampire bund. But the joureny to that goal is filled with obsitcals, betryals, blood, deaths and brooken hearts.I really like the set up - It can be used in so many ways. Of course used wrong the story can easily be a boring cliché feast, but in this case it used right. For one, DITVB includes many aspects - the political and economic, fears and prejudices, personal emotions and relationships, and the responseibility of ones position. And all are used in a very credibly way, the cenarios was no to far fetched or undermined. For another, the vampires wasn´t potrayed as soft twilight vamps either (can´t really stand that, I mean we are talking about vampires here!) - they could be cruel and do very questionable things to get what they wanted and reach their goals. Huge plus for me. The relationships between the characters flow pretty smoothly, it was very few if any cringe worthy moments. Even the love triangle was done in a pretty good manor. Often can those be pointless, cringy or just flat out bad - but in DITVB I acutally felt for all of the involved and the situations didn´t really feel forced to me. You should be warned do, this is not for a younger audience - it´s lot of nudity, all kind of sexual situations (some really bordering to the questionable), gore and blood. The pacing was pretty even, it was a nice mix of dialouge, action, plot, character interactions and mystery (mostly in the form of Akiras amnesia). And of course it´s some romance involved, just the right amount in my opinion. You should also know that the manga was still ongoing when this was produced 2010 and it´s a build up for a sequel that has yet to come. It´s nicely rounded in the final episode as of the end of an arc, but some mysteries, new enemies and questions are still present after the last episode.Art: 9/10For a 2010 production (by Studio SHAFT), I think it holds a nice quality to it - all throughout the show. Espacially the city backgrounds was particulary stunning. The color palette that is used are quite soothing with highlights of color exploations in special scenes. I think they managed to catch the dark undertones of the plot and its characters with carefully choosen colors such as shadows and darker colors, the vampires and werevolwes glowing eyes and the expression of them, or the baring of fangs when provoked or challanged. Character designs is on the cute and beautiful side - without anything espacially unique to their design. But all over very eye pleasing, so if you are into that you gonna love this. For an anime it´s pretty uncensored, you been warned, nipples will be on display time to time. Mina´s childish apperance can be disturbing to some watchers, but her childlike look do has it purpose. For the animation I thought it was good, the action scenes were good but not outstanding. Over all body moments was absolutely fine, with few weird angles or movements.Sound: 9/10As for the soundtrack I enjoyed it quite a bit! Much dramatical instrumental music were used, which i think suited the mood of DITVB very well. As for the OP it´s was ok but nothing oustanding. It felt like I had heard that kind of song multiple times and it didn´t brought anything new or memorbale. The two ED´s was better, espacially ""Tsumeato"" by Hibiku. Background sounds was doing it´s job  and was always on par with whats happened on the screen. As for VA´s I watched dubbed and was satisfied with their efforts. Their vocies was on par and most managed to bring out their character and give them life and personality. And Robert McCollum voices one of the supporting characters - and I love everything he does.Character: 9/10Which brings me to the characters. I most say that I liked most of them. Even if some was given sterotypical roles, did they manage to avoid their sterotypical developments and actions (in most cases). It´s just 12 episodes so of course didn´t most characters get the development and backgrounds that is so appreciated by us viewers. But the main characters Mina and Akira had both nice personal and relationship wise developments, and was given enough background story to satisfiy me.Mina comes of at first imperssion as a typical Moe. Which is funny because she´s all but that (again in most cases) - but that is in looks only. She is the ruler and leader of all vampires and despite her childlike apperance she´s centuries old, and bear a huge responseablity on her small shoulders. Mina is the only living (still undead not dead), royalty of her vampire clan and the survival of the vampire race lives and dies with her. She´s smart, strong, roughless, determined, and sometimes right out cruel. But at the same time is she compassionate, kind, loving, lonely and sad. I like that in a main character. Not all goodie good and not despiteful either - great mix in my opinion.Akira also comes of in the beginning as a sterotypical main male lead. Great looks, kind of shy hero like personality, and has his idea of whats right and wrong. But during time he no longer sees thing as black and white, and has to make so choices that goes against what he thought was the truth. He also suffers from amnesia and only remember the last year of his life. As he gets pulled into all this comotion, he starts to remember who he is and whats he´s ment to do. What I trying to say is that he isn´t the empty boring good looking male lead that never changes, he starts to grow into a man who chooses his path and faces his fate.As for the supporting and side characters - it´s so many. All given different amount of attention and screen time. Some of them are great and I would love to see more of them and learn more about them, and some are just there to fill their role and does it just fine.Enjoyment: 9/10I´m gonna be honest - I really didn´t have high expectations of DITVB. So many of the few Vamp animes out there is mediocre at best and bad at worst. So I was suprised how the first episode took me by suprise and was much everything I wanted from this kind of show. It pulled me in and and I bench watched the whole thing in just one day. I enjoyed DITVB a hell of lot. I will for shore pick up the manga now.Overall: 9/10A great vampire/drama/action show for shore. I would recommend DINVB to most people - even if you don´t think the vampire theme are that exciting. This show may as well be the show that turned you (yes, those words of choice was on purpose). Can´t believe the low score this show has (7,2). I can see that DITVB has it flaws and delibrate not explaining somethings, and has some questionable scenes but I truly enjoyed this display of a vampire story. happy with how satisfied I was after finishing ""Dance in the Vampire Bund"" (DITVB). It took the theme seriously and didn´t lay any fingers in between. I will elaborate why think this is a gem for all you out there that has the slightest interest in vampires stories.Story: 8/10After millennium in hiding the vampire race chooses to out them self to the world in the attempts to create their own free state within Japanese boarders, lead by their ruler princess Mina Tepes - direct dicendent of Vlad Tepes (Dracula). Of course this isn´t welcomed by all, both humans and other vampires. Especially not since rouge vampires are attacking humans and by doing so turing them. Mina and her allies goal is to coexist with the humans on their secluded island - which are called the vampire bund. But the joureny to that goal is filled with obsitcals, betryals, blood, deaths and brooken hearts.I really like the set up - It can be used in so many ways. Of course used wrong the story can easily be a boring cliché feast, but in this case it used right. For one, DITVB includes many aspects - the political and economic, fears and prejudices, personal emotions and relationships, and the responseibility of ones position. And all are used in a very credibly way, the cenarios was no to far fetched or undermined. For another, the vampires wasn´t potrayed as soft twilight vamps either (can´t really stand that, I mean we are talking about vampires here!) - they could be cruel and do very questionable things to get what they wanted and reach their goals. Huge plus for me. The relationships between the characters flow pretty smoothly, it was very few if any cringe worthy moments. Even the love triangle was done in a pretty good manor. Often can those be pointless, cringy or just flat out bad - but in DITVB I acutally felt for all of the involved and the situations didn´t really feel forced to me. You should be warned do, this is not for a younger audience - it´s lot of nudity, all kind of sexual situations (some really bordering to the questionable), gore and blood. The pacing was pretty even, it was a nice mix of dialouge, action, plot, character interactions and mystery (mostly in the form of Akiras amnesia). And of course it´s some romance involved, just the right amount in my opinion. You should also know that the manga was still ongoing when this was produced 2010 and it´s a build up for a sequel that has yet to come. It´s nicely rounded in the final episode as of the end of an arc, but some mysteries, new enemies and questions are still present after the last episode.Art: 9/10For a 2010 production (by Studio SHAFT), I think it holds a nice quality to it - all throughout the show.

make one of these animelist things just to throw my opinion out there an to get the record strait im a 19 year old male.. but im a strong believer in a hard core fast paced action packed anime with tons of romance i truly think u cant have good combat story lines without intense feelings getting thrown around iv fallen hard in love with anime's that are very simuler to this one hear an ill admit the art is half assed and it should have stretched out over about 4 seasons an i truly hate how...much love gets thrown around an looked past but that's as real as it gets people everywhere run across this issue all the time ware someone loves a person and thay love another i didn't care much for the constant younger older relationship thing that went down but all things aside it was a super spectacular anime that was super summarized... an yes i truly do believe if i had the funds and a year and the full permission of the creators i think i could easily do better art sound and stretch it out to be a very great and all around perfect anime as if it all ready wasn't a perfect short story but im truly grateful it wasn't a shity half thrown together anime like bleach witch in the begging was great all up to the story never took a turn for better or worse no one truly dies no one ever gives there life for the one thay love there is just a bunch of screaming ichgo an rukiu an that red heard girls name i mean it was a waste of 3 to 4 weeks of my life the up point in that was rengi and beyakuya but the rest of it blew dick other good ones if people actually read this stuff id have to say The irregular a magical high , seharfe of the end , Chivalry of a failed knight its amazing if you love tons of romance an combat expeshaly hand to hand and sword play its great but dont expect super bad ass in depth fight scenes it is a romance action after all.., SAO , GGO , Angel beats , Aquarion the first one was ok if you could push past the weird noises thay make and if you work in the day and sleep in the afternoons because your an insomniac like me i suggest all of these at some point as a mater a fact look into Tokyo ghoul my siblings seem to love fairy tale it was captivating but not my cup of tea death note is real interesting to really enjoying that but its real main stream but one thing i hate to say about all these anime that for real are perfect in all ways thay all are missing the one thing that shity anime like bleach always have length all the anime i names off are beautiful masterpieces just art in the up most great art, sound, charters, story lines, and above all thay can keep track of whats up whats gone down and thay all take you places the way anime should but you always get cut short because its hard to keep a great story going but a mediocre half assed story can push on forever all you have to do is throw you 5 or 6 undefetabel charters in new places to fight intense battles until you simply cant deal with how gay its really gotten cause all anime start good its the ones that get great that never make it far but if an anime gets past season one expect to find out real fast weather its great or just ok and a lot of mainstream anime that seem to be tossed around are just ok not to mention every anime creator has high hopes expecting his or her anime to get into season 10 an shit but always fall short around two its like writers block for book writers and stuff its all the same to be completely real if people actually read this far on my dumb ass rant sit down an try to wright an anime you have the basics from school

slowly antagonizing in others. As stated above this show shares a few similarities between the monogatari series. It\'s somehow at the same time more mature and even more so watered down. There were points in the show where I was genuinely surprised. Not because the show pulled something cool or anything like that, it was because I had to go to the wiki just to get a good explanation of most the things they glossed over in a single sentence. I won\'t spoil anything here but at one point I thought *insert evil...organization name here* was a person until I looked it up myself. I caught myself asking a lot of times ""Why are they even fighting right now?"" ""Why didn\'t she just do *this*"" or say ""*this*"" The worst part is in going back and skimming the series to write this review I actually caught and realized a lot of basic things that should\'ve been clear from the start. And don\'t even get me started on the numerous poorly done exposition dumps littered throughout the story. Anyway, 5/10Art: The animation in most scenes is actually pretty nice. Fights are meh though, lots of examples of slashes or static characters with camera cuts to make it seem like they\'re fighting without having to animate it.  7/10Sound:The VA\'s didn\'t do a bad job at all, I actually quite enjoyed listening to Mina transition from sweet and cute to cold and ruling.

Only one of these characters is entertaining even though they get about the same amount of screen time. Neither really changes much though.

It just really wasn't for me"", ""This is a bit of a strange anime, in that the main character of the story and the protagonist seem to be different, kind of. The main character of story is definitely Mina, in that she's the one that has goals that serve as the focus of the anime, the one who makes crucial choices that decide how things will move forward, and the one around whom all conflict is based. However, in terms of framing and perspective, the protagonist is Akira, someone who supports her throughout all of this. This results in an interesting dynamic that works really well sometimes, but also quite strangely...in others. The core of when it does work well is usually when its centered around their relationship with each supporting each other. When it doesn't is when they seem to get into conflict. Still, all in all the relationship between the two is pretty good. It's a relationship that reemerges rather than being born within the anime, so it feels like there is a good deal that isn't shown, but the chemistry between the two is good enough by the end that it feels natural enough. In terms of plot, it ends up starting out incredibly strangely, in part due to the main character/ protagonist dynamic, in that on one side there is Akira's story, which is entirely school focused, but on the other there's Mina's which is far larger and much more political. This ends up feeling tremendously awkward, in that the balance doesn't work at all, and it actually feels somewhat inconsistent how things are playing out due to the major difference in scale. It eventually does overcome that though in the final arc. The core story about establishing the Vampire Bund, and doing anything in order to do, is quite interesting with the various factions and view points involved. However, there was an issue in that it felt like a lot of background and the setting as a whole needed to be fleshed out a lot more, in that while it didn't feel rushed, it felt like there was explanation lacking to the point that sometimes things felt inconsistent and random. The plot ultimately ended on an arc that seemed to resolve everything leading up to that arc, hence making it a good place to stop, but also ended up introducing a whole lot more that needed to be resolved, seemingly setting up the entire rest of the story, which is a pretty standard place for manga adaptations to stop, though one that I'm not a fan of, but considering they were following the manga I suppose there wasn't really any better option. Also, as a side note, the side characters were amusing and interesting enough for what they were, but everyone else certainly is a side character and doesn't really get much development at all. The exception to that is the villain of the last arc, who made quite the good villain and felt well established due to how similar she was to Akira.The art and animation were amazing as SHAFT usually is. Though, while the action was well animated, it was pretty random without much substance.\xa0 Also, there was a lot of use of camera effects that was hit and miss, working incredibly well at times but feeling pointless and random at others. Stylistically too it felt somewhat all over the place at times. Still, though the motif of the butterfly in the last arc was a bit heavy handed, I thought worked really well. The soundtrack was pretty solid. The OP/ED were strange, in that the OP was also used as an ED and the ED was also used as an OP, each with their own sets of visuals, and while some of these felt cheap, when they were being used as they seemed to be intended to be used they were pretty great.tl;dr: An interesting plot in a world with an atmosphere that's incredibly great at times, but also quite awkward at times, centered around two characters that are incredibly great at times, but also quite awkward at times. in others.

The exception to that is the villain of the last arc, who made quite the good villain and felt well established due to how similar she was to Akira.The art and animation were amazing as SHAFT usually is. Though, while the action was well animated, it was pretty random without much substance.\xa0 Also, there was a lot of use of camera effects that was hit and miss, working incredibly well at times but feeling pointless and random at others. Stylistically too it felt somewhat all over the place at times. Still, though the motif of the butterfly in the last arc was a bit heavy handed, I thought worked really well. The soundtrack was pretty solid. The OP/ED were strange, in that the OP was also used as an ED and the ED was also used as an OP, each with their own sets of visuals, and while some of these felt cheap, when they were being used as they seemed to be intended to be used they were pretty great.tl;dr: An interesting plot in a world with an atmosphere that's incredibly great at times, but also quite awkward at times, centered around two characters that are incredibly great at times, but also quite awkward at times."", ""This anime is truly amazing!

I feel like the ending off the anime was horrible though, you can tell they had to sum it up really fast.

I am a  fan of the shape shifting and sire theme. If you are a big fan of vampires/supernatural creatures then I would say this anime is...worth watching but may not be the best one you have seen!

It pulled me right in.Story: The story was pretty unique. A vampire queen wants to protect her own kind by having Japan save/pardon a small portion for her kind to leave peacefully to coexist with the human race. The other part involves romance between her and Akira, a werewolf. I won't say much else. Though pretty interesting, I felt like the plot was a bit rushed and the series could have been expanded easily to a...24-episode series.Art: I enjoyed the animation. Plenty of action sequences, beautiful color detail on the females and eye color. Seemed to me the eyes were much of a focal point when looking at the characters.Sound: The Opening Theme and Ending Themes were fantastic. I love the singer's voice. Professional, crisp and powerful. Dark pop to me, heh. Otherwise the rest of the series, I didn't pay too much attention to the BG music, kinda tuned it out. The high rating is only for the opening and ending songs.Character: I enjoyed the main characters. Didn't pay too much attention to the side characters, with exception to Vera and Mei Rin. If the characters were flushed out a bit more, I would have rated the character value higher.Overall Enjoyment: I particularly liked the overall feel of the anime. Vampires trying to coexist with humans, the theme of undying loyalty and seeing how far one promise can go....this series appears to have some cute, childish moments, but this series is for those over the age of 16. 24-episode series.Art: I enjoyed the animation.

While the politicking, romantically troubled and not-infrequently naked Mina Tepis steals the spotlight in terms of character (much more so than our generic jacked werewolf high school protagonist), she's trapped within the mess of a plot that make her intentions...even more vague than perhaps even she would like them. What she's doing is given a lot of weight but never enough explanation or grounding to really make it compelling beyond the fact that she strikes such dramatic poses when talking about it.After the rather lackluster first episode that isn't representative of the substance or tone of the rest of the story it's almost non-stop drama and action, taking only the occasional breather to give any sort of substance to what's going on on screen beyond all the flesh and blood. This might sound exciting to people who are here exactly for those reasons, but more often than not it's just confusing as we whip from one shocking plot revelation to the next, adding yet more characters and intrigue in order to keep the viewer watching.The charitable reading of this work is that the is has to fit a much better-paced manga into 12 episodes, but even so this knowledge would not save it. Beyond the story itself, the art is lackluster and often leans on long shots with low detail in order to save on budget in a way that's reminiscent of the earlier episodes of Bakemonogatari but without the charm of the dialogue or characters.

I may end up sounding amateurish, so don\'t take it too seriously.Story wise? This anime has really made me think about how a vampire society would actually be structured. Would they live in a midieval-ish type society? Or perhaps would they be changing their lifestyles alongside with us humans? The anime also begs the question: Just what exactly is ""too much"" loyalty to one person is? Is there a point where sticking with someone you love is foolish? The story here does a really good job at that. Also, there are times where the story is spoken from a...poetic perspective, so the midieval feel is very strong here. There is a bit of fanservice though, some of it strange when it features Princess Mina as well, she has the body of a child. See what I\'m getting at?Art? Well, I\'m still pretty new to the anime biz honestly. So, although this show is quite old, I think its art style looks very modern and doesn\'t look outdated at all! The art direction really goes well with the ""nightstalker"" feel in my opinion.Characters. The characters in this show really feel alive and admittedly, I enjoyed watching their interactions with one another. Take Princess Mina for example. She has a very tough exterior befitting of a vampire royal, yet on the inside, she\'s just as emotional as any of us. Although some of the human characters do get shoved aside for the vampire cast, I do feel like it helps the story move forward as the protagonist is essentially tied to Princess Mina and the vampire lineage.Sound? Well, the sound effects and the soundtrack is great! I feel as if the timing of the music is never used inappropriately. A good example coming to mind is ""Fuan"" from the anime\'s soundtrack. Give it a listen! See if it sparks your fancy.Overall Enjoyment? This anime really was a fun ride to be included in. It\'s a shame it only lasted 12 episodes, as the ending of the anime makes the viewer want to see even more adventures with Mina, Akira, and the rest of their crew. This anime is one of the first non-romance central I watched, and I will recommend it to any vampire lovers out there.

They like to secretly cut out, alter, and censor scenes of this nature.I'd advise investing in a version of DITVB that uses the original source material but provides an option for subtitles.

Overall, this anime was ok and kept me entertained.Pros:-Interesting plot points-Has an original spin on the usual vampire content-Has some very likeable charactersNeutral:-A lot of the cast is sexualized women. Honestly it doesn\'t really bother me, but it\'s just something I noticed in this anime more than I do in most. I think it had to do with the genre clashing with having so many sexualized women, since I\'m used to that mostly from more lively/ upbeat anime....Cons:-The direction is awful. I can see where they were going with a lot of the shots and I appreciate that the got creative with aspect ratios, but the techniques they used were often used too much and some of the camera angles were just strange. A lot of the cuts between scenes were choppy too (Intentionally choppy can be an effective tool if used well, but these were not.)-The main character is boring. This anime is from a decade ago so I can somewhat forgive this, since over the years this type of protagonist has been used to death and become stale.-I feel like the pacing would be better if you read it. The first ""problem"" that gets solved goes at a decent pace, but the subsequent problems after are rushed.-There are a lot of things that aren\'t explained until later about the world which would have benefited the series to explain sooner.-We get little information and consistency on how vampire powers work or what parameters they fall into.-We get next to no information on werewolves-The handling of the relationship between the 17 year old and 13 year old was distasteful. Having immoral relationships in media isn\'t something I\'m against, despite obviously being against these types of relationships irl.

Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.Reading time: 2 minutes readReview:This is a good example of anime that\'s able to balance battles, political intrigues and social (facade) life, every single one of those aspects are well presented. The story are well paced at the beginning, but it\'s steadily getting faster towards the end, so much that it\'s getting confusing because they skipped a lot of details. Plot armor are unfortunately plagued this anime badly, it\'s used over and...over, but thankfully there\'s close to none plot holes as far as I know. The overused nudity though... I know they have it in the manga, but it\'s essential for the story, but here? Not so much, they added much more nudity than needed in the name of ""fan service"", but it just make the anime feels so cheap in the end of the day.The visuals surprised me a lot, for this kind of anime, from that year, the arts are sharp, vibrant and looks like it from 2020 already. The animation are pretty fluid, and the battles are enjoyable albeit lacking a bit in the choreography department. The model used for the building and vehicles are highly detailed, not the most precise one, but definitely above average compared to other anime. The quality are also consistent between the battles and non battles scenes, so a pretty good overall visuals.The music are okay, it\'s able to support the atmosphere and story to some degree, but unfortunately it\'s just not memorable, because I already forgot the OSTs just a day after watching it. The sound effects are meh, the weird choices made some sound effects felt out of places, it\'s so random... The seiyuus are doing fine for most of the time, but sometimes they just lack the tension needed, but it\'s not much, so I can say it\'s a pretty good performance both for the voice actors and the sound director.Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-A vampire anime that balance politics, battles and social aspects-Great visualsReasons NOT to watch:-A rushed plot that\'s rather confusing if you don\'t read the manga-Surprisingly lack of battle scenes for the genre-R18+, not suitable to watch with your kids over, but thankfully there\'s close to none plot holes as far as I know.

Honestly, I was expecting worse. It\'s in no way my favorite vampire anime, but it\'s definitely better some of them. This review was based entirely on the english dub.STORY: It started off great. The concept was amazing, in my opinion. I\'ve never seen vampires willingly reveal themselves into human society, and tell them that they plan to form their own nation within their country....The idea of a vampire nation within human society has been done before - but never with all humans knowing that vampires existed. The main focus however seems to be on Mina and Akira\'s relationship, rather than the development of the vampire bund and everything that interfered with it. I couldn\'t help but keep watching, but as the story went on - I did start getting bored. What was with all of Akira\'s flashbacks? Only one of them was actually explained in detail, and it was the last one he needed for his memory to be back in full. I like that he stood by Mina\'s side even without his memories, but I felt like they could have went into more detail on that.ART: Do I really need to say more? The animation was beautiful. I wouldn\'t say they had the best animation for a vampire anime, but it\'s up there. The true forms looked quite good as well. I was expecting all of them to be hideous, and for the most part, they were. Mina\'s true vampire form was the most spectacular one. The beast forms of Meiren and Akira were drawn beautifully as well, with a lot of detail.SOUND: The voice-overs were decent, and the OPs and EDs were very fitting of the series.CHARACTER: I liked Akira, but that\'s mostly because he\'s a bishounen and I can\'t help but like most of them - that\'s really all he had going for him aside from being a werewolf. Out of the other characters, Mina was the only one that had any true development. The loyal servant, Veratos, that will do anything for the ruler had already been done by other anime - and there was nothing about Vera that really made her stand out. Yuki didn\'t really stand out much either - just the classic ""girl next door"" that loves the male protagonist, the only difference is that she doesn\'t end up with him but that\'s canceled by the fact that she dated him pre-series. Wolfgang is Akira\'s father, and although he looked badass - we know nothing about him, but I suppose that\'s better than getting a lot of screentime and getting no development. I didn\'t hate the characters by any chance, but all of them could have used development. Yuki, Mina, and Akira are the only ones listed as main characters - but of those three, only Mina had any depth. They started trying to develop Akira near the end, but it was too little, too late; with them mentioning the amnesia early on, they should have been able to do a bit more with him. They didn\'t even seem to try with Yuki. Overall, the characterization was a disappointment.ENJOYMENT: Despite my dislike of the character development, among other things, I won\'t deny that I enjoyed watching it. The series definitely kept me wanting more; it took me less than 24 hours to watch the whole thing - and that\'s a feat for even the shortest of series with me.OVERALL: Dance in the Vampire Bund is by no means a bad anime. Yet, it\'s not a great anime either. If you\'re watching it just to watch it, you\'ll enjoy it quite a bit. However, if you go in with a lot of preconceptions, you might be disappointed. All vampire anime are done differently, but only some of them can actually make the genre enjoyable. Vampires are my favorite supernatural creatures, but very few anime can portray them well. Dance in the Vampire Bund is one of the few that can actually show us a decent portrayal of vampirism.

The series definitely kept me wanting more; it took me less than 24 hours to watch the whole thing - and that\'s a feat for even the shortest of series with me.OVERALL: Dance in the Vampire Bund is by no means a bad anime. Yet, it\'s not a great anime either. If you\'re watching it just to watch it, you\'ll enjoy it quite a bit. However, if you go in with a lot of preconceptions, you might be disappointed. All vampire anime are done differently, but only some of them can actually make the genre enjoyable. Vampires are my favorite supernatural creatures, but very few anime can portray them well. Dance in the Vampire Bund is one of the few that can actually show us a decent portrayal of vampirism.', ""It's hard to watch a love story unfold when you're rooting for the underdog in a love triangle.I was drawn in because I love vampires, fantasy, and handsome anime boys - and this ticked all the boxes for me. It's an EXCELLENT series that scores well in thoughtful writing, music, character development and more... it felt like I was watching an anime movie with cinematic frame cuts and zooms, perfect editing and metaphors in every single episode. I wouldn't describe it as anything other than a visual and literary masterpiece, as it evokes the kind of complex emotions one rarely feels from series today....However. Due to the complex (back)story of the vampire history, it also felt like the series was cramming too much content into 12 episodes. The main arc (the vampire kingdom's rise to success) ended by episode 7, and every episode after that introduced a new plot point that deserved another arc of its own. There was too much going on with too little time. And yet, the series focused almost exclusively on the relationship between Queen Mina and Akira during those limited 4+ episodes.If you are a fan of Mina's narcissistic character - and it looks like she has many fans on MAL - then you'll continue to enjoy the direction of the series. If you are do not worship her, nor care about romance, it's safe to say you can skip episode 8 onwards. They might as well be romantic comedies on the most unlikely couple ever.I'm not a fan of that, or rather, I'm a bigger fan of Yuki.Throughout the entire series, Yuki proves to be a solid friend, a selflessly kind, trustworthy, sensitive human, and she remains supportive towards the love triangle, even if her feelings are hurt or unaddressed. And yet, despite all that she does ... Yuki does not get a happy ending. It was painfully frustrating to watch Yuki not get an apology from Akira. To watch someone else's love story unfold, while your own is destroyed because of it. I couldn't stand that. She was deeply relatable for me, and even though I typically want 'vampires to win over humans no matter what,' in this case, I really didn't. I actually preferred the humans in this series, which speaks volumes on how shockingly awful the vampires were.In conclusion, I recommend episode 1 - 7 for the general public (18+ years old due to mature content), and episode 8 - 12 if you enjoy watching ridiculous relationships that would likely end in divorces in reality - I'll be the first to make a bet on it.

Futari wa Precure: Max Heart,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1929/Futari_wa_Precure__Max_Heart,"['I am PreCure fan. The first series is an especially wonderful TV anime. So, I was very, very disappointed upon getting around to watching Max Heart.My problems stem from the fact that the show has no real direction. We are treated to a endless number of ""Monster of the Day"" episodes. In FwPC, we often had a showdown against an enemy general. Here, we don\'t get that. There really is nothing but MotD episodes. What about character development? That\'s practically non-existent. Nagisa and Honoka do not grow any at all. Nothing is added to them. In fact, throughout the series, they become flanderized to hilarious...extremes.  Shiny Luminous adds nothing either. She is a talking plot device.As for the animation quality, it ranges from mediocre mid-2000\'s quality to just plain atrocious. In an early episode, a fight focusing on Shiny Luminous has it\'s animation quality slowly degrade, finally to the point where it looks like an acid trip.Sadly, there isn\'t much more to say than the above. This is essentially MotD episodes repeated 45 times (not counting the first & last episode) with varying levels of animation quality that never gets better than mediocre. If you really like Nagisa and Honoka, pick a random episode, think of it as a side story, and you can probably have some fun. However, I do not recommend watching this from start to finish. You\'re better off just watching the first and last episode, pick a few random ones, and just watch some other PreCure shows. extremes.  Shiny Luminous adds nothing either.

It was a strong start with endearing characters, a lot of good moments and strong, surprisingly physical fight scenes. Unlike many magical girl works, Precure believes in having their characters kick and punch instead of just tossing out stock animation special attacks. It also had a pretty strong ending that wrapped everything up. Which makes today's material a little odd. Futari wa Precure Max Heart is a direct sequel with the same characters, one of the only series of its like in...the franchise. So, do they have something interesting for Honoka & Nagisa to do?Story:After the events of the first series, Honoka and Nagisa have entered High School. It's t this point where Honoka notices some feelings starting to well up, but she's afraid to act on them since Nagisa hasn't shown interest in girls like that. Thus begins their sweet and sublime love story.Okay, so that doesn't happen. The actual story takes place with the two of them in their last year of junior high. They're living normal lives in the wake of the Dark King's defeat. Unbeknownst to them, the Queen was critically wounded during their battle. She loses her cohesion, splitting into her life, her heart and her wills which take the form of tiny fairies called Heartiels. To make matters worse, the two heroines find themselves under attack by a new band of villains, Shampoo Advert, Moustache, Chin & Female. This time around they also have help, in the form of Shiny Luminous, Mai. In that fashion, Honoka, Nagisa & Saki find themselves in a race against time to find all the aspects of the Queen before their antagonistic foursome can bring back the Dark King.Let's start by looking at the big issue with the series as a whole. There's way too much of a focus on Nozomi and Pollun. He's as obnoxious as he was in the last series, except now there's a lot more of him, and she's just boring. Consequently, all of the emphasis on the two of them is tedious at best. Aside from that, the series just feels pointless. They're back to fight the same big bad with the same major attack, except powered up while working towards gathering the pieces they need to get the same resolution. How very exciting for all of us.On the positive side, there are still some strong moments, particularly when Urara stays on the sidelines and lets Nagisa & Honoka do their thing, and there are still some remnants of the good humour and generally entertaining moments that made the first series work. They're just not nearly as prevalent or as strong.Characters:Nagisa and Honoka are still really good characters and there are a lot of colourful and endearing personalities from our reoccurring side cast. Unfortunately, most of them have much more limited roles in this series. That being said, there are a lot of issues with the new characters. I've already mentioned how dreadfully dull Karen is, and how obnoxious Pollun is, so let's look at some of our other major characters. Our antagonists in this series, Shampoo Advert, Moustache, Chin & Female, are really one-dimensional. The Heartiels are also really dull. Although, in their case there is some reason behind it. Each one is supposed to represent one aspect of the Queen's still non-existent personality. I guess it was easier to imply that she has these traits than it was to actually show her use any of them ever. We're also introduced to Pollun's sister, Lulun. She has all of the characteristics that make him such a nuisance, but she's actually less annoying to me due to the simple fact that the one who suffers the most from it is Pollun and it's a bit cathartic to see him get a taste of his own obnoxiousness.Art:The art isn't as strong as the first series, oddly enough. It still has creative monster designs, although fairly bland designs for the main four villains. It's action sequences aren't as strong either.  There are still some really good action sequences, particularly during the climax. The punches, kicks and grapples get used, especially in those stronger scenes, but they're downplayed in this one. Komachi doesn't even bother with them. She either uses special attacks or, at one point, she lets  the light coming from her device deflect attacks while she just holds it up like an idiot. Speaking of Luminous, there's also the issue of Rin's facial expressions. With the other characters, they're allowed to display a wide range of emotions. With her, most of the time she just has a blank look or an expression of dull surprise. It's almost like the animators wanted to capture her lack of personality.Sound:The strongest performances in this come, like the last series, from Honna Youko & Yukana. Ikezawa Haruna and, to a lesser degree, Tanii Asuka are the big weaknesses. To be fair to them, they did get cast as the annoyances and I doubt anyone could make those characters sound pleasant or emotionally complex. Even if they'd had Ishida Akira & Hayashibara Megumi voicing them they'd almost certainly still be cacophonous. To be fair, most of the actors sound fine. There are some, like Tanaka Rie, who sound like they're not trying but I'm almost certain that's a result of their characters having less emotional depth than your average paper-clip. The music is still good although, in some cases, a bit lazy. The opening theme is seriously just a remix of the opening from the first series.Ho-yay:The les-yay isn't as strong in this series as it was in the first. Primarily because Setsuna acts as a third wheel, showing up whenever Honoka and Nagisa are having a moment and ruining the whole thing.Final Thoughts:Futari wa Precure: Max Heart is a pretty underwhelming sequel. While it isn't bad and it does retain some of the good aspects of the first series, it also gets encumbered with a lot of pointlessness and suffers from adding a whole lot of trite characters with the most egregious being Miki. Yuru Yuri likes to joke about Akari's lack of presence, but that girl is so unbelievably boring I'm not sure I even got her name right. It also suffers from excessive use of Pollun. All in all, I think the annoying moments and the good moments even out pretty well. In the end, I give it a 5/10. It's an average series. Next week it's Overlord. the franchise.

When I watched Prettycure, I loved it. This however, I didn\'t like.It almost seemed like it was 95% of their everyday lives and at the last 5% a monster appeared.  It felt very rushed when it finally came to transforming into prettycure.Their lives and their battles also didn\'t seem very connected like they were back in prettycure. Kind of if you watched the first part of a T.V. show then watched the second half of another. It just doesn\'t flow very well.  This show seems to have no relation to the original series. I also didn\'t like how...they seemed to put Nagisa(Natalie) and Honoka(Hannah) as""not the most important characters.""So I advise you NOT to watch this anime. they seemed to put Nagisa(Natalie) and Honoka(Hannah) as""not the most important characters.""So I advise you NOT to watch this anime.', ""“It was meh”, that's some words I hoped to not have to say after the amazing experience I had so far going through the franchise, even despite the issues I had with the first season of this entry that were saved more than enough by the positives, but Max Heart in my opinion is a sequel that doesn't provide enough freshness to feel necessary to be there.The biggest change compared to its prequel is the introduction of Hikari, another girl with powers (but not considered a Precure) that fully focuses on supporting abilities for the girls, not being able to properly fight like Honoka and...Nagisa do. Her calm and quite adorable personality is likeable, but she isn't particularly memorable IMO, and the show is once again carried by the main duo… that start to suffer from just the length of the series being too much for the depth of their characters, with 50 episodes it was more than enough for the fantastic development of their friendship, and in Max Heart it kinda becomes an overkill with some episodes feeling too similar to things already done previously because there isn't that much more to do for them.The biggest negative in any case is definitely the villain side, Precure is a franchise that has some really lovable and/or memorable villain characters that bring a lot to the series, but that's not the case for Max Heart, they are just so forgettable and outside of the pretty funny Uraganos there is nothing I can even think of to describe the other evil characters, something I can't even say to the already underwhelming baddies from the second half of the originalWith the significant negatives said, here come the good parts.

For a series I thought would never end, and for what I hated about last season\'s ending, along with the amount of pointless filler, they can really pull together some tear-jerking moments. Honoka and Nagisa giving up and dropping to the bottom of despair only to find hope. That\'s really a wonderful moment because it felt so genuine and wholesome. I didn\'t actually think Hikari would be able to give up her life, but when she did, it was really sad seeing the graduation scene, and I was as...shocked as Nagisa to see she returned. (it\'s a deus ex machina, but I don\'t mind really. Other series get away with this as well, so why not.) That said, the season does have a fair degree of problems; some of these include severely limited animation. The animation in the first half of the series is frequently off-model and only vaguely illustrated at times; most scenes take place in the mansion, Tako Cafe, or the school. As a character, Hikari\'s characterization appears to be wildly inconsistent, showing an unnatural degree of mood swings and actions which suggest the opposite of what she\'s saying. She is also overly reliant on Nagisa and Honoka to protect her, not even bothering to transform half the time, despite stating she wants to protect them, as one example. The evil generals were serviceable to the plot, but lacked the charm that previous Dark Zone members had. After a while, Hikaru/the little boy simply became boring as there was nothing to his character outside of his relation to the Dark King, and thus most of his scenes felt wasted, especially when they occurred every episode. Character development was also limited; nearly every episode with Nagisa involved her as the butt of a joke, or involved her in a needless and fruitless romance with Fujimura. The series also relies overtly on stock footage; about four minutes of each episode is devoted to stock footage or 6-7 minutes including the opening and ending themes. Porun wasn\'t a problem, but Lulun was; Lulun\'s character served no real purpose at all other than to provide Porun with his own annoyance. This wouldn\'t be a problem if done properly, or if Porun was actually as annoying as other mascots who would deserve this. This show also lacked the animation to demonstrate the villains as a serious threat; for instance, let\'s say a character was thrown 20 feet down into a wall. Instead of showing the impact, the character would simply ""cushion"" themselves, as though they\'d landed on a pillow, depleting much of the impact. As for Honoka and Nagisa, many of the impacts can\'t be said to have hurt them whatsoever; for about 80% of the attacks directed at them, they would simply backflip to perfectly land on their feet standing up MID ATTACK. This makes no sense whatsoever. The Heartiels were somewhat grating and dragged on the plot more than needed, considering each Heartiel stayed around about 3-4 episodes, for no apparent reason other than to watch the main characters live their lives. Unfortunately, I will be required to rate the series only a 5/10. shocked as Nagisa to see she returned. (it\'s a deus ex machina, but I don\'t mind really.

Go! Saitama,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49895/Go_Saitama,"['""Go! Saitama"" or as I like to call it GOAT Saitama, is an animation made by the series illustrator Yusuke Murata, and is simply one of the most masterful pieces of media to ever be created by the human race.It truly shows you the genuine struggle that the common man goes through when his wallet is on the line.Having a character go through a relatable situation has never actually been done before in literature, so I find this to be a very interesting approach to storytelling. Animation quality is completely out of this world.Every facial expression and incredibly detailed moment of body language on...screen truly helps you understand the genuine struggle that Saitama is facing, and how much getting that bargain bin pork rind really means to him as a character.There is no sound throughout the entirety of the experience... Just complete silence. What an absolutely artistic and creative move on Murata\'s part there. Where most would add things like ""sOuNd EfFeCtS"" and ""mUsIc"", this minute and a half of pure absolute bliss decides to take a different approach. How truly subversive...Skydiving? pfft laaaameSex? BOOORRRRRIIIIIINNGGMeeting the girl of your dreams and having two beautiful children and growing old to see them prosper in life?

Halo Legends,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6867/Halo_Legends,"['It\'s really hard to rate this because of the fact that only a select few of the episodes are good compared to the rest, which are garbage.The Babysitter.  This one was okay.  Animation was pretty good, action was good, characters actually had a personality.The Duel.  Words can\'t describe how epically bad this was.  Shit animation (looked like I was trying to watch through a fogged-up window), set in some garbage fuedal Japan imitation (totally out of canon), insane amounts of melodrama, characters they WANT you to care about but can\'t.  And the actual ""duel"" at the end is so retardedly...anticlimactic they should change the name of the episode.The Package.  Also okay.  Pretty nice animation.  All I really have to say.Origins I.  Cool for learning about the back story.Origins II.  See above.Homecoming.  This was alright.  Nice psychological view into spartans\' minds.Prototype.  BY FAR the best one.  It did THE BEST job out of all of them giving the characters depth in such a small time frame.  The animation was great, the action was the best out of all of them, AND it had David Matranga as the main character (who does his character great justice).  The only problem I have with it is that it\'s not really clear why the prototype--and all pertinent data--had to be destroyed.  They just say it does.Odd One Out.  Holy shit.  This is so retardedly out of canon it isn\'t even funny.  What the fuck is the point of this garbage?  What the hell is going on?  Why are there two random humans who have DBZ-type powers?  Why is there a dinosaur?  Why does 1337 have DBZ-like powers?  God... this is shit.  The sad part is that THIS is the episode in which they decided to cast Greg Ayres, Bittney Karbowski, and Chris Patton--renowned, talented VAs whom anyone who knows ANYTHING about English-dubbed anime knows at least one of.  They got shit roles for shit characters for a shit episode.  Oh, and Cortana looks retarded.All in all, didn\'t live up to the stupid amount of hype it received.Oh, and the credits are always epically long, but that can\'t really be helped I suppose.Alright.

Click that troll button. ;)', 'This is my first review, so I’m sorry if you feel it is not as good as other reviewers.Halo Legends, based on a popular game franchise is quite actually a good adaption of short stories that I rather enjoyed.This review is based on a person who has played all the games and knows the storyline in which the games told.""Note to people who have not played the games""You may not like or understand this anime due to the anime adaption not following the main story line from a to c, its meant for halo fans to be able to understand the universe more and how...the events of the past lead to events that happened in the game.I can\'t rate the series overall as one series that follows one storyline main plot because it’s so diverse in that sense it offers 7 different stories and many different art styles, by many different anime developers.But I will say that where one story shines, another may not shine as much.Story 9/106 stories, which cover different aspects of halo\'s history, from its birth to its rebirth and how things led up to the story of halo: combat involved.there is also a parody episode based in the halo universe but its not canon.How well did they tell the history and events that happened?I must say that it was very well done, from a narrated episode from the AI Cortana who was the master chiefs assistant in the game, to characters that only got introduced in the graphic novels, to totally new characters which help the viewer understand the halo universe aswell as expanding the halo universe and of course a episode with the master chief himself in which expands and explains more of his past and the other Spartans past.Art 9/10The art of each story are rather unique in certain areas, but all of them expect for one episode have familiar anime art styles.The art itself in each episode is great, and fairly enjoyable to the viewer who is watching.it the art itself which has a negative for me because of the use of so many different styles, one episode may put off a viewer and they may get annoyed of the art style and not like it as much as the other art style for example in the previous episode.But this is also one of its pro\'s because of its diverse art style, there is sure to be an episode where someone\'s tastes is met.So from where one episode follows traditional anime style, to one that is heavily CGI based to one that is totally unique and has a water paint blurry effect.Sound 9/10the sound is great and to be expected from such renowned anime producers, from the dramatic halo soundtrack that is everyone is familiar with to a eastern soundtrack that helps portray the characters for example in one episode there is 2 elites that are fighting and the soundtrack you hear helps strengthen the idea of the elites being people who considered honour as their way of living who can be greatly related to the samurai of Japan.""note to readers"" the original anime is english speaking and from my view very well done so please do not be put off if you prefer japanese speaking over english.Character 9/10The characters are portrayed very well, with the art styles and the soundtrack being so good, it is hard not to like the characters.I think that without the great sound and art and story, it would be hard to relate to the characters usually but because the other elements of the anime is done so well you straight away feel the emotions of the other people in some episodes and feel their agony and desperation to shock and regret.I will give a brief introduction the episodes and my thoughts on them.""The Babysitter""Is an episode about a group of hell jumpers or better known as orbital shock troopers who go on a mission with a Spartan.my thoughts on this episode is that it tries to tell the viewer on how the Spartans where portrayed from the public eye of other UNSC personal and this one focuses on one particular hell jumper attitude to working with a Spartan on an important  mission that I will leave for the viewers to find out the details of.""The Duel""Is based on the elites and is about an arbiter that will not follow the covenants beliefsmy thoughts on this episode is that the art style is rather unique, and may put off the viewer or irritate them when watching the episode but it should not distract the viewer in general from understanding the story its self and what it is trying to portray.""Origins""Is a 2 part episode narrated by the AI Cortana who explains past events of the history of the halo universe.My thoughts on this story were that it was very well done, and that it does a very good job of explaining how things came 2 in the halo universe.I will state that these 2 episodes should be watched first for maximum enjoyment from the viewers and people who have not played the halo games.""Homecoming""Is an episode that shows how the Spartan program recruited and how the Spartans came to terms with themselves.my thoughts on this, is that it does a good job of portraying and introducing other Spartans but the episode itself is 2 short to give justice to the characters themselves, but does the job of explaining how the Spartans was recruited.""Prototype""The story is focused on a Marine who is sent to a distant planet to destroy prototype powered armour.my thoughts on this, is that it does a great job portraying the main character who you as a viewer as never heard of before and is nice to see a different event that doesn’t involve any Spartans but instead shows a man coming to terms with his past and the decisions he chooses to make that makes him human.""The Package""is a story that is a two-part all CGI-film taking place during a raid that consists of Spartans including the master chief that raid a Covenant  Battle cruiser to take back a package.my thoughts on this, is that the CGI itself is quite good, but due to it being an anime I believe CGI does not feel right when watching an anime that contains episodes that are not all CGI.""Odd One Out""This episode is a parody story of Halo universe and is not canon.My thought on this episode is that it was quite funny, and they should make more episodes like this.EnjoymentThis adaption is quite enjoyable, though some of the episodes are quite emotional it just makes the episodes even more enjoyable.The negativity can come in at a start of an episode with a different art style but once the person gets into the episode the difference in animation goes away and the person can enjoy the episode.Overall I give the anime a 9/10, because of its various art styles and interesting story plots, but because of the episodes being so short the viewer may feel unsatisfied, but overall the anime is more like a taster and helps introduce more characters into the halo universe so that maybe in the future we can hope to see more of these people in later halo productions.but for someone watching who is not familiar with the animations background (played the games or read the novels) i would give it a 6-7/10 i think. the events of the past lead to events that happened in the game.I can\'t rate the series overall as one series that follows one storyline

sheer overpowered, Steven Spielberg amped action. The story is propped up with Halo Lore which will diddle most Halo fans. The art is acceptable, and the sound is okay.That aside, dont expect to be met by any sort of cutting edge animation, in unique character exploration, or really anything that makes it more than Halo fan service.While the different aspects of the series aren't dreadful in particular, the lack of uniqueness makes for a show that you cant wait to move on from,or unless you're a Halo nerd, you'll enjoy the novelty of it. "", ""It's very hard for me to do this review since each short is different and made by a different company but overall these shorts are fantastic (This is coming from the point of view of a long time Halo fan since she was 7 years old)The Babysitter: 9Animation was pretty decent and for a short period of time I did get emotionally attached to the characters. There is also a good twist ending that people will enjoy.The Duel: 9For me the animation was unique and colorful. I wish they developed more but this was actually for me the saddest out of all of them. The...fight scenes were extremely epic.The Package: 7I have to say this is my least favorite. The animation though CGI looked a bit campy to me and I really don't think CGI goes well with anime unless it's a video game. When I first heard John 117 it was off putting because I'm so use to his original voice but as I watched more episodes I got use to it and forgave that. I also didn't like how Halsey is so young but there are good things about this too. The action is awesome and it does reveal a lot about who was Cortana's maker and such.Origins Part 1: 9Very great recap of Forerunner/Flood War and why Halo was created. Animation was a bit too simple but I loved how much this one can suck you in by a matter of seconds.Origins Part 2: 10Second part has better animation and is more epic than the first. Contains the most memorable moment in the entire series.Odd One Out: 10Hilarious. That's all I have to say. O yea and hearing Brittney Karbowski       (Black Star) and Chris Patton is win.Prototype: 10What can I say about Bones? Amazing animation, amazing story, amazing everything.Homecoming: 10The second saddest of the bunch. Very interesting and gripping and finally they were able to depict Halsey correctly.So that's my overall review. Again I'm writing this in the point of view of a long time Halo fan since she was 7 years old so if you don't know Halo I don't know what your POV on this will be. fight scenes were extremely epic.The Package: 7I have to say this is my least favorite.

Hard to rate being a collection or ONA. Seems the ratings and reviews are all over the place and if you don\'t like halo to begin with, you probably won\'t like Halo Legends.I am a fan of the Halo series, I\'ve read some of the books and I own or owned all of the games but one. But I\'m not so much a super halo geek fan that I approached this with a biased opinion, ZOMG!! ItZ Haloz!! AHM CHARGIN MAH...you get the picture.I\'m going to give each segment it\'s own overall rating:Origins part one and two is first...up and it\'s a really good back story to the depth of the halo universe so, if you interested about the expanded universe the covers a lot. It\'s well animated and the narrator does a fine job as well. Not much more I can say about it I guess.  8/10The Duel is just like one of those animes that takes itself too seriously. All the elites are now wearing samurai armor and it seems the Elite society is just like pre-modern Japan. Sure, maybe there\'s some similarities with Elite and Samurai code of honor but yeah...that\'s about it for similarities. Also I didn\'t like the ridiculous filter they used over the animation, it\'s like your watching it through a translucent glass window. 3/10I feel iffy about the next segment, ""Homecoming"". It\'s well animated, great sound and the action scenes are well presented but it was more about two friends or lovers or whatever that were in the spartan program. It\'s all deep thoughts and memories. The MC goes to her former home to find she\'s been replaced. It\'s like when one of the gundam series (00, wing or seed) tries to do a heartfelt self discovery episode and it ends of feeling too manufactured. 6/10Next is Odd One Out. I know it\'s suppose to be comic releif but ughhh. The Spartans name is 1337. He fights a t-rex then two super powered teenagers join him to fight a giant ape thing. Yeah, dbz fans, you can have this one. 3/10Prototype is pretty good if you just want so damn action. Actually it feels like something right out of one of the games. The covenant come to steal some prototype technology and the commanding officer ops to use it in the fight rather than give it up. The visuals are exciting and like I said, good action. 7/10I\'m not sure why but the version I watched on Netflix didn\'t have the segment called The Package. Oh well, I\'m sure it\'s okay.Lastly, is my favorite, The babysitter. The baby sitter here is a spartan and the babies are the ODST, not that ODST are babies, more like reliable spec op badasses. It\'s not like the stories amazing though, it\'s just about the rivarly between ODST and Spartans. The animation is great and very lucid looking. It gave a very nice atmosphere, like I was reading it in a book. Actually if the writers and production house that made this took it upon themselves to make an animation adaption of the Halo book Ghost of Onyx, well, that would be damn alright with me.Story - 6/10Art - 8/10Sound - 7/10Character - 6/10Enjoyment - 5/10Overall 6/10 up and it\'s a really good back story to the depth of the halo universe so, if you interested about the expanded universe the covers a lot. It\'s well animated and the narrator does a fine job as well. Not much more I can say about it I guess.  8/10The Duel is just like one of those animes that takes itself too seriously. All the elites are now wearing samurai armor and it seems the Elite society is just like pre-modern Japan. Sure, maybe there\'s some similarities with Elite and Samurai code of honor but yeah...that\'s about it for similarities. Also I didn\'t like the ridiculous filter they used over the animation, it\'s like your watching it through a translucent glass window. 3/10I feel iffy about the next segment, ""Homecoming"". It\'s well animated, great sound and the action scenes are well presented but it was more about two friends or lovers or whatever that were in the spartan program. It\'s all deep thoughts and memories. The MC goes to her former home to find she\'s been replaced. It\'s like when one of the gundam series (00, wing or seed) tries to do a heartfelt self discovery episode and it ends of feeling too manufactured. 6/10Next is Odd One Out. I know it\'s suppose to be comic releif but ughhh. The Spartans name is 1337. He fights a t-rex then two super powered teenagers join him to fight a giant ape thing. Yeah, dbz fans, you can have this one. 3/10Prototype is pretty good if you just want so damn action. Actually it feels like something right out of one of the games. The covenant come to steal some prototype technology and the commanding officer ops to use it in the fight rather than give it up. The visuals are exciting and like I said, good action. 7/10I\'m not sure why but the version I watched on Netflix didn\'t have the segment called The Package. Oh well, I\'m sure it\'s okay.Lastly, is my favorite, The babysitter. The baby sitter here is a spartan and the babies are the ODST, not that ODST are babies, more like reliable spec op badasses. It\'s not like the stories amazing though, it\'s just about the rivarly between ODST and Spartans. The animation is great and very lucid looking. It gave a very nice atmosphere, like I was reading it in a book. Actually if the writers and production house that made this took it upon themselves to make an animation adaption of the Halo book Ghost of Onyx, well, that would be damn alright with me.Story - 6/10Art - 8/10Sound - 7/10Character - 6/10Enjoyment - 5/10Overall 6/10', ""Warning possible SpoilersNow giving something like this probably makes me a huge Halo fanboy, true I am a Halo fanboy, but these few episodes managed to reveal more and expand upon this amazing universe.Story (10/10)There may be only 9 episodes, but each one focuses on different stuff that goes on in the Halo universe and it doesn't just focus on the humans either, even the Arbiter gets his own episode showing us more how Sangheili culture works and what their like as a species.A lot of the episodes do involve humans fighting against the Covenant along with the odd Spartan, but it really goes into...depth between the relationship of the UNSC marines and the Spartans, not knowing where they really came from and whether they should trust them to get the job done.Even the Master Chief and blue team get a full episode to themselves, showing how well they work together and how badass they are.It even tells us about the origins of Halo and how the Forerunners managed to beat the flood by having to sacrifice themselves.I also found it funny how we even got an episode that felt like a proper anime version of Halo, feeling a lot like the ridiculousness of DBZ.Characters (9/10)There is a wide variety of characters to choose from, as each episode focuses on someone different or a whole group of people entirely.What I really like about this, is that it opens the universe beyond the games and by this point the latest game would've been Halo 3 ODST, so fans knowledge of the Halo universe would've been very secluded to the Master Chief. These episodes help show us there are more characters out there who made an impact on the war with the Covenant along with giving us a character from the Covenant as well to show us that there's a story here as well.But it also does give us some Master Chief as well just to keep the main fans happy, while also showing us why he is such a good leader with other Spartans.However I think out of all the characters Spartan 1337 is definitely one who stands out and feels like the Halo version of Deadpool and would fit very well in an anime version of Halo, since his snarky and overconfident personality make him a very enjoyable character.Art (10/10)What I really like about almost every episode is the different artstyles used for them, making each episode feel unique and would stand out. The best artstyle from an episode would have to go to The Duel which looked really well done and showed that Sangheili were not too different from the ways of the Samurai.Odd One Out also stands out too, because it felt like it was going for a DBZ parody, just within the Halo universe and it did that very well.Sound (10/10)Music and sound effects wise, were great, they really captured the true essence of Halo and what it stands for, despite the music being taken from the games it was redone very well and fitted the moments of each episode.Extras:What I really like about these episodes, is that they try to focus on every possible aspect, ranging from the battles, to the spartan program and the Spartans themselves and it even allows us to take a look into the Covenant more as we see they aren't the complete monsters their shown to be in the games.Enjoyment (10/10)Overall (10/10)When it comes to adapting a video game into a viewing format like a film or an anime, this definitely gets the feel of Halo spot on and really does well to give us stories to expand it's universe beyond the games. depth between the relationship of the UNSC marines and the Spartans, not knowing where they really came from and whether they should trust them to get the job done.Even the Master Chief and blue team get a full episode to themselves, showing how well they work together and how badass they are.It even tells us about the origins of Halo and how the Forerunners managed to beat the flood by having to sacrifice themselves.I also found it funny how we even got an episode that felt like a proper anime version of Halo, feeling a lot like the ridiculousness of DBZ.Characters (9/10)There is a wide variety of characters to choose from, as each episode focuses on someone different or a whole group of people entirely.What I really like about this, is that it opens the universe beyond the games and by this point the latest game would've been Halo 3 ODST, so fans knowledge of the Halo universe would've been very secluded to the Master Chief.

Animation and art are great, story-wise it makes sense (don't let a piece of important technology fall into enemy hands), and characters come across as human and are likeable. Not exactly sure how his platoon died but it was probably not directly his fault otherwise he would have been discharged and court-marshalled earlier. Him staying behind I thought wasn't the best idea, he could have just delegated the role to a lower-ranking officer. His voice might have been required...for setting off the nuke though, so it could be explained away.Possible improvements: didn't really need to play the flashback twice, we already got the message beforehand so we knew what she said at the end anyway. I also didn't see the platoon sergeant whom I assume was going to be taking charge after the platoon leader's death. for setting off the nuke though, so it could be explained away.Possible improvements: didn't really need to play the flashback twice, we already got the message beforehand so we knew what she said at the end anyway.

""WOOOW....""  I will not go into each episode because you have already taken that trip through the other reviews.  So here\'s the ""skinny"" from someone who has watched anime for many years.This can be compared to The Animatrix & Batman Gotham Knight.  It is a collection of stories that take you into the Halo universe.  It gives you a history of how things began & stories from other perspectives, that will tie-in answers to unanswered questions of the game followers.  Those who don\'t follow the game...are in for an experience into this universe that has been at war throughout space & time.This collaboration of stories have been written, animated & produced by a collection writers, directors, producers & animation studios from Japan.  The main directors overseen the entire production in making sure that each episode stayed true to the original story line of the game.  The 8 different episodes all have a different animation look.  Each one, even-though done in a different animation style, brings to life a different aspect in how the story is viewed (from who\'s eyes) based on story being told.Like with anything, in order to know what it\'s truly about, you should watch it and base your own opinion; especially if you\'re reading these reviews - it only shows you have a curiosity of what\'s going on....

It\'s one of the most ambitious and well made franchises in the gaming industry. Master Chief is a badass, the story and mythos are engaging and mysterious, the characters and drama are complex, the scope is immense and Bungie creates the most addicting and creative multiplayer game modes than any other FPS franchises out there (suck it up your ass, BF3 and MW3!). So I decided to review Halo Legends and I gotta say.... Bravo, 343 Industries. This compilation of different anime stories, created by different anime studios, is a very fun and exciting treat for fans of Halo that...want to know more about the mythos of the Halo universe and clearly it does it very well. Halo Legends did receive some mixed reception, cause they complained on adding an anime style look to the Halo franchise, just like the reviewers that bitched on the anime look of Batman Gotham Knights (I wish I can kill all anime haters B3). So I will review each different story separated and provide as much details without spoiling, so that it can be easy to read on without complications and I will rate each short with my own rating and thoughts about it.1. Origins (Score: 10 out of 10):Origins is basically the story on the origins of The Forerunners and their downfall during the invasion of The Flood (before Halo 1 on Xbox) and how humanity has lived on to survive: Endless war and the reason to fight for the sake of all living things. The animation was done by Studio 4C and it looks absolutely breathtaking on my HDTV. The amount of little detail references of the Halo games is excellent and it still has the same grand scope from the games, the action is rough and relentless, and it does give us some clues on who Master Chief really was during his early life on Earth. A fun story that really nails the Halo feel to it and a good start for the different stories to come.2. The Babysitter (Score: 9 out of 10):This one had less action, but it really didn\'t need that. Animated by Studio 4C and it\'s about a group of ODST soldiers (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper) who are giving a mission to eliminate a prophet so they can eliminate The Covenant\'s weapon supply and the shooter for the mission is a Spartan and so they go out to their objective to eliminate the target. This one kinda drags in the beginning, but the characters are fun to hang with and it does deliver a fun and energetic action scene with the Spartan against a hulking Brute (DAMN!). On top of that, the animation is gorgeous and it much more detailed than their other short story ""Origins"". Not the best one, but still great and satisfying.3. Odd One Out (Score: 8 out of 10):This Halo story is less dramatic and it just a hyper and action packed short story, just for some fun. The animation is done by Toei Animation, the same people that worked on the Dragon Ball franchises, and their animation in this one look surprisingly detailed in this one. The art is colorful and with some flashy colorful DBZ style visuals that fans can be happy with and the character models look very expressive and smoother. The story here is about a Spartan with an annoying attitude and huge amount of bad luck named ""Spartan 1337"", as he crashes on a planet and gets left behind by Master Chief. He meets some kids who live with a computer A.I. that they call ""Mother"" and he battles a super-soldier like Brute. The character ""Spartan 1337"" is annoying, with his lack of honor and with a wanna be badass attitude, but I will credit to the character cause he does have a badass and insane action fight scene with the giant Brute. Overall, this one is for the action, fun and humor.4. The Duel (Score: 6 out of 10):The Duel is simply about an Arbiter (not to be confused with the Keith David one) who doesn\'t want to follow ""The Great Journey"" cause it\'s all a lie. The Prophet then accuses Fal of heresy. Fal refuses and he sends an Elite to kill his wife so that he can fall into the trap. It\'s more of a simple revenge story and to be honest, this one was a disappointment for me. The character Fal was mediocre and uninteresting, he\'s just there to avenge his wife and to die in the end (SPOILER!). The animation by Production I.G. is decent and creative with the watercolor style effects, but the CG effects are just bad and doesn\'t mix very smoothly with the art. The only good thing about The Duel is the battle scene where the Arbiter fights off an army of Elites, grunts, Brutes and Hunters. For shame, Production I.G.5. The Prototype (Score: 9 out of 10):Prototype is about a soldier named Ghost, a warrior who has a haunting past of his old troops that died with him, due to his choices that he made during a battle, and therefore, he suits in on a badass mecha Spartan suit to sacrifice his own life to save the other survivors from The Covenant attack. The animation is done by Studio Bones (Wolf\'s Rain, FMA and FMA: Brotherhood) and it looks very impressive. It has a darker and more sentimental look to it and the main character Ghost is well portrayed and worthy to the cast of all Halo characters. The final climax scene with the Spartan mecha suit is exciting to watch and totally worth the time of admission.6. Homecoming (Score: 10 out of 10):Homecoming tells the story of Daisy, a Spartan who was taken away by her parents when she was a child and forced to be a Spartan on ""The Spartan II Project"". She escapes and as she returns to her childhood home, Daisy discovers that now a clone of her lives in the house and that she is now move on to be a Spartan while remembering her cruel past. I liked this story a lot, cause it really shows you the cruelness that The Spartan II Project brings to her and quite frankly, I feel incredibly sorry for her. The animation is done by Production I.G. again and it\'s a godsend improvement over their other work The Duel. It\'s much more vibrant, less grainy, detailed and colorful, and with much needed variety than The Duel. The ending of this story is depressing, but it leaves you with that Halo chill that goes through your spine. An improvement for Production I.G. and a nice story to boot  for the Halo franchise.7. The Package (Score: 8 out of 10):The Package is the seventh and last short story of Halo Legends and I was fully satisfied through the entire time. It\'s all about Master Chief and other Spartan members trying to retrieve a package from Covenant forces and to bring it safely to the UNCS base pronto. The animation was done by Casio Entertainment and the CG is impressive as fuck. It really looks like I\'m watching a Halo cutscene coming to life and the scope is just great on it\'s own. The action is relentless and the little duel with Master Chief and the Elite is short, but kinda neat. Also, be on the look out for some nice touch references on Halo gameplay (you will like it).So there we go, I reviewed each different Halo story with my honest opinions, but what do I think as a whole? Well I would say this: Halo Legends is a fine example on how studios can be creative with the stories on the Halo mythos without doing anything offensive or nonsensical to ruin the franchise. Mixing an American product with anime style art is nothing new, but at times it can be very fun to watch cause the animators can make different and unique takes on that proper franchise and Halo Legends is no different. If you\'re a Halo fan or an anime fan, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Halo a lot like me and 343 Industries clearly shows that they will take care of the Halo franchise with great honesty and respect for Bungie. want to know more about the mythos of the Halo universe and clearly it does it very well.

Each story is separate from the others and produced by a different anime studio. Each episode lasts approximately 15 minutes for a total run time of nearly 2 hours.Halo: Legends has a total of 7 stories, technically 8. The first story is Origins, which is a recounting of the Halo universes history from the distant past to present day. It\'s entertaining to watch and it can catch anyone who isn\'t familiar with the in-universe history up to speed in about half an hour. It also presents possible plot points for future...Halo video game titles. The second short, The Duel, is set in the distant past not long after the formation of The Covenant. It explains how the rank of Arbiter became a mark of shame. This is a critical piece of Halo lore that should not be missed, even if it can be a bit over dramatic. The third short is Homecoming. It\'s a side story that follows a Spartan II named Daisy. To be honest, this one, while self-explanatory, was also a bit confusing. It sheds some light on the Spartan-II project, but otherwise doesn\'t do much else in terms of story. Though it does have a nice bit of fan service at the end. The 4th short is known as Odd One Out. This short is the only non-canon episode of the Halo: Legends collection. It\'s a parody of sorts that makes Halo seem more like Dragon Ball Z. It\'s hilarious to say the least. It\'s a nice change of pace from all the seriousness I\'ll admit. The 5th short is Prototype. This one is one of the more serious episodes and tells a more Human story than the others, revolving around the Marine known as Ghost. The tagline BE HUMAN is constantly brought up, whether through dialogue or other means. Best to keep that in mind while watching if you want to truly understand this episodes purpose. The 6th short is The Babysitter, which follows the ODST\'s of the 105th on a mission to assassinate a prophet with the help of Spartan Cal-141. This episode is entertaining and at the same time serious. It shows just how dangerous the job of an ODST can be. The last short is The Package. Unlike all of the other episodes in this collection, The Package is entirely CGI rather than hand-drawn animation like the rest. It follows the series titular character Master Chief John-117 as he leads a team of Spartans to recover an important package. It\'s an action-packed episode and has no real meaning other than to be entertaining.The art style varies from episode to episode due to the change in production studios. Origins has a very fluid art style and at times looks slightly reminiscent of something out of a Miyazaki film. The Duel trades in traditional animation for a cel-shaded animation style with a watercolor overlay. This gives it a distinctly unique appearance in contract to the rest of the episodes, but it is quite beautiful to look at and is by no means out of place or unwelcome. Homecoming features a simplistic art style that rarely has many details. The quality of the art increases at times for important scenes, but other than that, it looks kind of low budget. The same can be said for Odd One Out, which does not feature heavily detailed art, again having a more simplistic art style. The greatest amount of detail can be seen in the only scene where it rains, which is quite beautiful. Anyone who has watched the Dragon Ball series will instantly feel at home with this art style as it was made by the same production studio. Prototype has the highest detail out of all the hand-drawn episodes. Being more gritty and realistic in terms of art style, there is a lot of detail in the appearances of the characters, the explosions, vehicles, and environments making this possibly the most visually appealing out of all of them. It adds character to the episode and goes along quite nicely with the tagline ""BE HUMAN"". The Babysitter on the other hand goes back to a somewhat simplistic style. The characters are often low-quality while the backgrounds are extremely detailed, and to be quite honest, this is actually a nice trade-off as it really brings out the character of the environments. The Package is a completely CGI episode, making it appear more similar to The Duel in terms of art style, minus the watercolor effect. The models are all very highly detailed and the effects go quite nicely with the action. Though I do have to take issue with the physical depiction of one specific character who is portrayed as far younger than they actually are.The sound design remains mostly consistent between episodes, reusing sound effects and soundtracks between each of them with some unique tracks and effects to make them stand out. This was likely a budgetary issue rather than a lack of creativity. The dub is unfortunately a Sentai dub, however, they at least did a decent job at casting characters and they don\'t quite feel lifeless. David Matranga plays Ghost quite well. However, it was kind of disappoint that none of the voice actors from the video games reprised their roles for these anime shorts. The actors that replaced them fit well with the characters, but it just seemed out of place.Because all of the shorts are separate from one another, there is no lack of new characters between them and very rarely is a character shared between episodes. The physical depiction of Master Chief John-117 varies between the episodes he is featured in and he seems to display more emotion than his video game counterpart. In fact, he seems closer to the Master Chief depicted in the novels. Cortana narrates the entirety of the Origins episodes, acting as a historian of sorts. She also appears in Odd One Out albeit briefly. Ghost is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a broken soldier in the series and while many may find him bland or unlikable, I personally found him to be the opposite and easily one of my favorite characters. Spartan-1337 provides quite a bit of comic relief in the parody episode Odd One Out. Being a parody, he can get away with a lot of things that normally wouldn\'t happen. He is also the closest thing we\'ll get to a Spartan version of Goku. Dutch from ODST is also present in the episode The Babysitter, although his voice actor did not reprise the role. And just to clarify, the Arbiter seen in The Duel is not the same Arbiter as Halo 2 & 3. This Arbiters name is Fal\' Chavamee, while the Arbiter in the games is named Thel\' Vadamee. Or in the case of Halo Wars, Ripa\' Moramee. Sorry about that quick diversion.Overall, this series was a phenomenal collection. I thoroughly enjoyed the anime take on the Halo franchise. And as a Halo fan and an anime fan, it was a dream come true for these two to be thrown together and I honestly hope a Halo: Legends 2 is produced at some point in the future, perhaps as a full-fledged television series or feature film. If you\'re a fan of Halo, or looking for a good sci-fi story, Halo: Legends is a pretty good watch and I highly recommend it, though the varying tones between episodes may not be for everyone.

Though it does have a nice bit of fan service at the end. The 4th short is known as Odd One Out. This short is the only non-canon episode of the Halo: Legends collection. It\'s a parody of sorts that makes Halo seem more like Dragon Ball Z. It\'s hilarious to say the least. It\'s a nice change of pace from all the seriousness I\'ll admit. The 5th short is Prototype. This one is one of the more serious episodes and tells a more Human story than the others, revolving around the Marine known as Ghost. The tagline BE HUMAN is constantly brought up, whether through dialogue or other means. Best to keep that in mind while watching if you want to truly understand this episodes purpose. The 6th short is The Babysitter, which follows the ODST\'s of the 105th on a mission to assassinate a prophet with the help of Spartan Cal-141. This episode is entertaining and at the same time serious. It shows just how dangerous the job of an ODST can be. The last short is The Package. Unlike all of the other episodes in this collection, The Package is entirely CGI rather than hand-drawn animation like the rest. It follows the series titular character Master Chief John-117 as he leads a team of Spartans to recover an important package. It\'s an action-packed episode and has no real meaning other than to be entertaining.The art style varies from episode to episode due to the change in production studios. Origins has a very fluid art style and at times looks slightly reminiscent of something out of a Miyazaki film. The Duel trades in traditional animation for a cel-shaded animation style with a watercolor overlay. This gives it a distinctly unique appearance in contract to the rest of the episodes, but it is quite beautiful to look at and is by no means out of place or unwelcome. Homecoming features a simplistic art style that rarely has many details. The quality of the art increases at times for important scenes, but other than that, it looks kind of low budget. The same can be said for Odd One Out, which does not feature heavily detailed art, again having a more simplistic art style. The greatest amount of detail can be seen in the only scene where it rains, which is quite beautiful. Anyone who has watched the Dragon Ball series will instantly feel at home with this art style as it was made by the same production studio. Prototype has the highest detail out of all the hand-drawn episodes. Being more gritty and realistic in terms of art style, there is a lot of detail in the appearances of the characters, the explosions, vehicles, and environments making this possibly the most visually appealing out of all of them. It adds character to the episode and goes along quite nicely with the tagline ""BE HUMAN"". The Babysitter on the other hand goes back to a somewhat simplistic style. The characters are often low-quality while the backgrounds are extremely detailed, and to be quite honest, this is actually a nice trade-off as it really brings out the character of the environments. The Package is a completely CGI episode, making it appear more similar to The Duel in terms of art style, minus the watercolor effect. The models are all very highly detailed and the effects go quite nicely with the action. Though I do have to take issue with the physical depiction of one specific character who is portrayed as far younger than they actually are.The sound design remains mostly consistent between episodes, reusing sound effects and soundtracks between each of them with some unique tracks and effects to make them stand out. This was likely a budgetary issue rather than a lack of creativity. The dub is unfortunately a Sentai dub, however, they at least did a decent job at casting characters and they don\'t quite feel lifeless. David Matranga plays Ghost quite well. However, it was kind of disappoint that none of the voice actors from the video games reprised their roles for these anime shorts. The actors that replaced them fit well with the characters, but it just seemed out of place.Because all of the shorts are separate from one another, there is no lack of new characters between them and very rarely is a character shared between episodes. The physical depiction of Master Chief John-117 varies between the episodes he is featured in and he seems to display more emotion than his video game counterpart. In fact, he seems closer to the Master Chief depicted in the novels. Cortana narrates the entirety of the Origins episodes, acting as a historian of sorts. She also appears in Odd One Out albeit briefly. Ghost is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a broken soldier in the series and while many may find him bland or unlikable, I personally found him to be the opposite and easily one of my favorite characters. Spartan-1337 provides quite a bit of comic relief in the parody episode Odd One Out. Being a parody, he can get away with a lot of things that normally wouldn\'t happen. He is also the closest thing we\'ll get to a Spartan version of Goku. Dutch from ODST is also present in the episode The Babysitter, although his voice actor did not reprise the role. And just to clarify, the Arbiter seen in The Duel is not the same Arbiter as Halo 2 & 3. This Arbiters name is Fal\' Chavamee, while the Arbiter in the games is named Thel\' Vadamee. Or in the case of Halo Wars, Ripa\' Moramee. Sorry about that quick diversion.Overall, this series was a phenomenal collection. I thoroughly enjoyed the anime take on the Halo franchise. And as a Halo fan and an anime fan, it was a dream come true for these two to be thrown together and I honestly hope a Halo: Legends 2 is produced at some point in the future, perhaps as a full-fledged television series or feature film. If you\'re a fan of Halo, or looking for a good sci-fi story, Halo: Legends is a pretty good watch and I highly recommend it, though the varying tones between episodes may not be for everyone.', '1. if you havent played any halo game, atleast download halo combat evolved, its free, it can run on almost any computer, you will understand it better if you play campaign.Ok 8 on story because, well each story is only 20 minutes long, besides Origins but its just 2 20 mins videos, And each story is different.  However if you know what halo is or atleast the basis of it, you will understand every one. they also are stories basic on fans input.The art is amazing, each story might have there own design, Duel is like an old black and white animation mixed with...new, and Babysitter is like common anime, Package is 3-d animation.Sound is perfect, mostly because Bungie, creators of Halo, probably help with all the weapon sounds and covenant sounds.Character, for 20 minutes the development is well done, they dont go into much detail for Master Chief, Cortana, and Dr. Halsey,  but you already know them.Just saying I do have a bias, im a BIG halo fan new, and Babysitter is like common anime, Package is 3-d animation.Sound is perfect, mostly because Bungie, creators of Halo, probably help with all the weapon sounds and covenant sounds.Character, for 20 minutes the development is well done, they dont go into much detail for Master Chief, Cortana, and Dr. Halsey,  but you already know them.Just saying I do have a bias, im a BIG halo fan', ""Halo legends is both a hit and a miss. There are many different episodes directed by many different studios and directors who all add their own unique spin to the halo universe. Some of these are welcome and others not so much. All but one episode in this series is halo canon.Overall, it's a solid experience for halo EU fans.If you dont like halo or the EU, stay away.Apparently my review is not long enough to please the MAL gods, very not pog dude. I don't have much to say about the show, it's good at moments but for most of the ride is...just OK. just OK."", ""Review to self:Plot: each new episode after the 2nd shows a new character storyline, after watching the 3rd episode or the 'Arbiter' storyline I have made my verdict that it may not be worth watching because there are parallel storylines. Noain character of the entire series, more so main characters per episode. This makes it a bit boring to watch...Art and sound:Art style is different, I assume its been handmade from a 3D render or it has a filter over a 3d render. Decent art style and sound design, not the fanciest but definitely worth mentioning.Characters: I don't personally find parallel storylines to be my...cup of tea so this anime, despite being a remake of the game franchise I loved, didn't live up to the hype. I felt the story was all over the place after the 3rd episode.Enjoyment: almost fell asleep a few times from watching it, no interesting elements whatsoever.Overall 3.5/10 I might give it another go in a few years though cup of tea so this anime, despite being a remake of the game franchise I loved, didn't live up to the hype. I felt the story was all over the place after the 3rd episode.Enjoyment: almost fell asleep a few times from watching it, no interesting elements whatsoever.Overall 3.5/10 I might give it another go in a few years though"", ""if you have not gotten into the lore of halo or have not played the games at all then you will absolutely not like this show, but if you have it is an amazing watch.there are so many stories in the halo lore that are in this show which is just amazing, and personally makes me so happy, and how they executed all these stories was just amazing. if you have never heard of halo then everything makes absolutely no sense, I'm pretty sure they don't explain anything about the universe in the show so if you come in blind then you won't have...a good time. a good time."", ""This is an anthology show so each episode will be reviewed separately. It’s basically the Halo version of Star Wars Visions, but Halo did it first. One side note for all of them: the music is great but it’s literally just ripped straight from the game’s soundtracks. The DvD navigation screen sucks.Origins I & II: The animation for these first 2 episodes is very weird. Some shots look fantastic but most of the time it looks low budget. I appreciate how they focus on the time of the Forerunners. They’ve been a ominous figure throughout the Halo games and this is the first time we...really see what their civilization was in their prime. The threat of the Flood is perfectly stated and the sacrifice the Forerunners made was given the respect it deserved. Due to the narration style of storytelling the cinematography was great but it was more of a collection of concept art than it was a motion picture. Cortana’s themes (especially in II) seems flat and kind of forced and the Floods second defeat was oddly detached from the games but I appreciate the recap. 6/10The Duel: This is the most visually interesting of the episodes. The cinematography is great but the blurred images do get hard to look at sometimes. I absolutely love this depiction of Sanghelios and of the Elites. The Elites in the games have always been shown to be prime warriors who base their beliefs in honor and respect so to show Sanghelios as an old Japanese inspired city is strangely fitting. The Elites are shown with respect, not as villains but as honorable men being deceived, as shown to be true in Halo 2. It was amazing showing the fall of the Arbiter’s title and his fight scenes were extremely badass. The dishonorable Elite in old samurai Armor dueling Arbiter with energy swords is probably my favorite piece of Halo Cannon. The wife was painfully boring and a Mary Sue but the classic dramatic Samurai story just fits so damn well with the elites. The lack of their mandibles throws me off but this is still a damn cool story. 8.5/10Homecoming: This is a damn good episode. The fight scenes were disappointing after The Duel but what I really love is the focus on the Spartans in training. The story of Daisy is a tragic one and I love the focus on both the Spartans' humanity and the cruelty of the Spartan II program. Daisy risks everything to escape the brutal training and return home, but when she returns she meets her clone, realizing that she had been replaced, she returns on her own volition. This scene in the garden is extremely melancholic and later hearing that her comrade had killed his clone is strangely haunting to think about. In the end they came back on their own accord. I think this story is fantastic. It was a bit weird how easily Daisy was killed but whatever. 8/10Odd One Out: This really is the odd one out of the episodes. Strangely goofy and comedy focused. There are many inconsistencies to the Halo cannon but when Spartan 1337 is this damn funny I really don’t care. Yeah the dinosaurs are a bit weird and I hate how these kids are just as strong as him, but this dude is funny as hell. This is a pretty bad episode but when you have a spartan say ‘I’m something of a Mama myself’ in a serious tone, I can’t help but enjoy it. 5/10Prototype: This story seems more tailored towards a spartan. It’s about a man regaining his humanity after he had to conceal his feelings to cope with war. I thought the fight scene was cool but most of this is just melodramatic. Works with the music though. 6/10The Babysitter: O'Brien was kind of annoying but I love how badass they make the Spartan in this one. It really shows just how powerful they are compared to normal soldiers but it also shows how powerful brutes can be. The fight scenes were cool and so was the spartans death. 7/10The Package: 3d actually looks kinda good. Cool fight scenes but not much else to it. Halsey looks stupid. 6/10 really see what their civilization was in their prime. The threat of the Flood is perfectly stated and the sacrifice the Forerunners made was given the respect it deserved.

Haiyore! Nyaruko-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11785/Haiyore_Nyaruko-san,"['In an age where media is thriving and the economy is stagnating and slowing to a crawl there’s often the question of product quality versus a more cost-effective approach. This holds especially true for the anime industry where the bulk of the paying audience are exploitable and easy to profit from. There\'s a sizable amount of anime where a certain degree of integrity and quality is held over the potential of large sales numbers  and, conversely, there are shows where quality is disregarded and instead replaced by a number of efficient pandering methods.Unfortunately, Haiyore Nyaruko-san is one of the latter.The anime takes place...in a world where deities of the Cthulhu Mythos are secretly wreaking havoc on Earth, often having their horrifying appearance and demeanor replaced by that of a cute teenage girl... or boy. After the titular Nyarlathotep arrives on Earth to save Mahiro from a sudden alien attack, she chooses to stay at his house after deciding that she loves him. This, of course, confuses our dear protagonist and gives precedence to his tsundere behavior.As the episodes pass more deities begin to work their way into Mahiro\'s treasured and so-claimed ""normal life"". The first of which is Cthuko, a twintailed and obsessive bisexual incessantly chasing after Nyaruko and her body much like Nyaruko does with Mahiro. Hastur also makes an appearance, a young boy who looks very much like a girl and frequently causes confusion to Mahiro as a result of that. Other characters include Mahiro\'s mother, secretely working as a deity hunter, and Ghutatan, another deity in the form of a small girl that joins in on the shenanigans for the final two episodes.Calling any of these characters interesting would be a gross overstatement.These are one-dimensional and stereotypical archetypes that do little except fulfilling the audience\'s penchant for attractive young girls. Most of the interaction between them revolves around the same repeated jokes and situations, used again and again with not a single care for change. Nyaruko will behave in a forcefully lewd manner towards Mahiro, often involving sudden kisses or talks of marriage, and then he\'ll become angry and stab her with a fork. Cthuko will go on to do most of the same towards Nyaruko and she\'ll push him away because of her love towards Mahiro. After seeing this interaction repeated for the nth time it becomes incredibly stale and tiring. It really makes evident that there is nothing going for the characters besides their physical appeal, and Xebec frequently exploits that and uses it as its way to catch an audience.In between all the awful character interaction there\'s an abundance of superfluous otaku references. These include dozens upon dozens of titles such as Back to the Future, Ichigo Mashimaro, Ashita no Joe, Denpa Onna, and Haruhi. Now, references to other anime can be amusing and add to the comedic value when they\'re implemented well but that\'s very far from being the case here. There aren\'t just a few thrown in during each individual episode, but rather dozens of times in each, sometimes flipping from one reference to another in the span of about 15 seconds. There\'s no transition and little context, they just happen. Repeatedly. What\'s most shameful isn\'t necessarily how bad or annoying these references can be, but that Xebec has apparently decided that comedy isn\'t even relevant as long as you make piles of references towards shows that the audience may have enjoyed.There\'s a point where it becomes funny and then there is a point where it just devolves into frustration and pandering. The occasional anime reference can be quite nice, but in Nyaruko-san it does nothing but infuriate and make watching the series an arduous experience due to their superfluous usage. Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is an anime that has about all the comedic sophistication of Hannah Montana and Meet the Spartans.For an anime that is constantly parodying other series and their tropes, it really makes you wonder when the same cliches and issues are present in the show itself. Harem members suddenly ""transfer"" into the same classroom as the protagonist, characters decide to neglect their duties to go on a trip to the beach, the protagonist and main heroine (mistakenly) bodyswap with eachother, and people walk in during inopportune moments and misunderstandings follow as a result. There\'s a glaring amount of cliches and, sadly, these are mostly important or genuine aspects of the series rather than simple parodies or references. If you\'re looking for anything unique or original in that regard then you are most definitely not going to find what you want here.The only thing to set this series apart from any other bad harem anime is the addition of the Cthulhu Mythos, but even this is mostly made irrelevant by how the story and deities are changed and bastardized from their Lovecraftian counterparts. It\'s an element that seems unique and interesting at the start of the series but it quickly fades from prominence in favor of fanservice and otaku references. A pretty unfortunate fact considering the rich amount of content and depth found in the Mythos. Much more value than in this anime, anyway.Oddly enough, the series is actually bearable during the rare dramatic moments. When the terrible character dynamic is put aside and Mahiro and Nyaruko think about how much they really like eachother, it can actually be somewhat heartwarming and the characters can almost verge on being likable. It\'s just unfortunate that these moments can\'t even be counted with a full hand.Another minor positive can be attributed to the art. While the budget is modest and the animation quality is passable at best, the vibrant art style and color palette makes the show a lot more pleasing to look at than most. It\'s refreshing to see something that actually contains color when the majority of anime instead rely on dull hues of grey, brown, or blue. That said, you can polish a piece of trash, but it will always remain nothing more than trash.It\'s hard to determine just where this series went wrong. Perhaps the concept of the series was already flawed and doomed to failure, but a large amount of the blame can be shifted towards the studio and their insistence on pandering over quality. For people that are simply looking for a show that they can watch while turning their brains off, this is a poor but not quite terrible choice. For the people who want something more in their entertainment that extends beyond aimless fanservice and otaku exploitation, Haiyore Nyaruko-san is an insulting series with any inherent value or amusing moments being next to nil.Somehow I think Cthulhu monsters might be less frightening than Haiyore Nyaruko-san. in a world where deities of the Cthulhu Mythos are secretly wreaking havoc on Earth, often having their horrifying appearance and demeanor replaced by that of a cute teenage girl... or boy.

Anything above a 5 should be considered ""good"". MAL reviews are broken, but I\'m at least trying to fix mine. Please take the time to read it all.Here\'s a quick TL;DR rundown of Haiyore! Nyaruko-san1- You\'ve probably seen it before. There\'s nothing special about this Anime. The story is just a sequence of events thrown together so as to fit as many gags as possible in, the characters are recycled, the gags are overused. If...you\'re looking for plot, or great comedy, you won\'t find it in Nyaruko.2- The Anime is character based. As with all Anime targeted towards an Otaku audience aiming to be as marketable as possible, Nyaruko\'s strength is with it\'s characters. They\'re memorable, they\'re funny and they each have their own distinct trope. Some people maybe see this as a bad thing, and in a sense it is, but for what Nyaruko is aiming for, it\'s succeeded in making the characters as fun as possible.3- Because it\'s a character-driven anime, the art and character designs are great. Who cares about plot when you have these beautiful pictures to look at? Or so they want us to think. It\'s not that bad though. They designs are clear-cut, distinct and present the constant moe and service very well.4- The music is good. Catchy OP; better ED. All\'s nice and well. Of course, they\'re just OPs you\'ve heard a million and ten times before in other Anime, and Nyaruko doesn\'t even try to be original. It knows it doesn\'t need to be.5- It\'s a light hearted watch. As I\'ve said on countless other Anime, don\'t take it too seriously. No; it\'s not GREAT, it\'s not groundbreaking and it certainly won\'t appeal to everyone. But if you want something light-hearted and fun, and you enjoy squealing at moe characters and laughing at over the top gags, then you\'ll probably enjoy this. you\'re looking for plot, or great comedy, you won\'t find it in Nyaruko.2- The Anime is character based.

Actually, I do.Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is the epitome of a plot-less anime, with the absence of ""true"" romance, conflicts, or any character goals. This makes Nyaruko-san very polar; you either love this kind of random comedy, or hate it. And I happen to love it. It is such a relaxing, fun anime to watch, something you can enjoy without having to focus too hard on picking up the details.The core of the anime is based around light parody comedy, while throwing in a TON of references. This anime has so many references to...video games, TV shows, anime, etc. that you won\'t catch them all. And of course, it\'s very enjoyable  when you do understand one. All of the characters are very likable, allowing viewers to easily become attached to them.This anime never takes itself seriously, and you shouldn\'t either. It has no problem creating plot holes, turning a tense situation into a joke, or breaking the fourth wall. By definition, Nyaruko-san does everything that would make an anime bad; but because it does it purposely, and pulls it off so well while giving you a great laugh, you can\'t help but enjoy it.A mix of To-Love Ru\'s supernatural & Lucky Star\'s comedy, Haiyore! Nyaruko-san does everything that caters to fans of those anime, while still presenting refreshing ideas. A high recommendation for fans of those genres. video games, TV shows, anime, etc. that you won\'t catch them all. And of course, it\'s very enjoyable  when you do understand one.

By definition, Nyaruko-san does everything that would make an anime bad; but because it does it purposely, and pulls it off so well while giving you a great laugh, you can\'t help but enjoy it.A mix of To-Love Ru\'s supernatural & Lucky Star\'s comedy, Haiyore! Nyaruko-san does everything that caters to fans of those anime, while still presenting refreshing ideas. A high recommendation for fans of those genres.', 'The most unexpected anime series airing in this 2012 spring season I would say would have to be Haiyore! Nyaruko-san. It can be categorized as both Parody and Comedy at the same time and shows great promise as it is a series that does not take itself seriously and is unafraid to show itself as such. If it\'s able to keep up the level of quality, this series has a good chance of becoming the best comedy series of this year.In H.P. Lovecraft\'s stories, the Cthulhu was an unspeakable, indescribable horror that haunted the collective dreams of mankind. In Nyaruko-san, the Cthulhu is a cute...girl sent from the stars to protect a typical normal guy.Mahiro Yasaka is a normal high school guy until he finds himself pursued by a monster one night, only to be saved by a cute girl bloodily slaughtering the monster with her bare hands and then jauntily declaring, “I am the chaos that always creeps up to you with a smile, Nyarlothotep!”, Nyaruko for short, while striking a sentai hero-type pose.She was sent there to protect Mahiro and it\'s revealed that she practically begged for the assignment, partly so that she can get her hands on some Earth entertainment (anime and manga apparently being highly-valued throughout the universe) and partly so that she can cozy up to Mahiro, much to his dismay.However Mahiro isn\'t completely dominated by Nyaruko, but tries, in his own ways, to fight back the stranger who ""destroyed"" his peaceful life. At this point that usually involves him wielding and trying to skewer Nyaruko with a table fork.Nyaruko, despite being in some respects the stereotypical hyper-aggressive girl, is such an abjectly ridiculous character, and is played with such unrelenting enthusiasm, that it\'s difficult to watch the episode without a constant bemused smirk on one\'s face. Nyaruko is way too perky for a creature of a well-known horror mythology and generally a lot of fun to watch. She\'s always moving and switches conversational modes at the drop of a hat. It helps that she looks nice as well. She also has a proportionate body without either inflate-a-boobs or a little girl figure.The first episode enjoys small recognizable moments, with Nyaruko\'s back story fast-forwarded (complete with squeaky VHS sounds), comments about how the show will get taken off the air if the characters aren\'t careful, and a slew of images in a store that have a very familiar look to them. Add in some sentai jokes and a Pokémon reference and you get a parody element that helps to make this more entertaining than it might appear at first glance.That said, within its hyperactive romance-comedy framework, the series works really well. Nyaruko is amusingly nuts and the jokes about her Lovecraftian origin are entertaining. She\'s only in cute girl form because her real form would cost Mahiro a lot of ""sanity points"" and her horrific origins are hilariously apparent in her sickening fighting style (brutal beat downs using rocks to crowbars). She\'s also refreshingly open about her feelings for Mahiro which reminds me so much of Lala from To LOVE-Ru.The animation isn\'t perfect, but there\'s enough flow that it\'s easy to watch and the music has a definite sense that it could grow on you.This looks to be a series that will have me groaning at the end of each episode, disappointed that I need to wait for the next episode. girl sent from the stars to protect a typical normal guy.Mahiro Yasaka is a normal high school guy until he finds himself pursued by a monster one night, only to be saved by a cute girl bloodily slaughtering the monster with her bare hands and then jauntily declaring, “I am the chaos that always creeps up to you with a smile, Nyarlothotep!”, Nyaruko for short, while striking a sentai hero-type pose.She was sent there to protect Mahiro and it\'s revealed that she practically begged for the assignment, partly so that she can get her hands on some Earth entertainment (anime and manga apparently being highly-valued throughout the universe) and partly so that she can cozy up to Mahiro, much to his dismay.However Mahiro isn\'t completely dominated by Nyaruko, but tries, in his own ways, to fight back the stranger who ""destroyed"" his peaceful life.

Nyaruko-san perfectly.This show is about a young high school boy (I know, I know) named Mahiro Yasaka, he lives an ordinary life until one day he is attacked by a demon and saved by a young alien girl by the name of Nyarlko. Afterwards she confesses her love for him and well we get a stereotypical ""hijinks ensues"" plot for the rest of the show. The main focus is Mahiro fending off Nyarlko\'s constant advances (which as kind...of refreshing, it\'s usually the other way around) We get introduced to a few entertaining characters, Cthuko, a alien girl who is in love with Nyarlko and constantly tried to keep her apart from Mahiro, even threatening to burn him into ash at one point. Hastur, a trap who is in love with Mahiro and constantly vies for his affection.The art and sound aren\'t necessarily bad, but they\'re not anything you\'d remember all that much, doubt any of you are on the edge of your seats for the Nyarlko Original Soundtrack, one thing I will say is the opening is stupidly good, check it out on youtube if you have a chance, amazingly addictive.The characters are the main selling point of the show, the interactions between all of the different characters and the situations they find themselves in are just priceless, but as I said before, this is purely subjective.Enjoyment is either very high or very low depending on whether you fall into the niche of this particular show. It\'s moe, It\'s ecchi, it\'s comedy, and it\'s satire, if these don\'t appeal to you then you simply will not like this show.Overall I give this show an 8 out of 10. It\'s a hilarious show with a nice cast of characters that interact with each other in hilarious ways, it might not be for you, the plot might put you off, but give it the old 3 episode rule and you might find another show to add to your list! of refreshing, it\'s usually the other way around) We get introduced to a few entertaining characters, Cthuko, a alien girl who is in love with Nyarlko and constantly tried to keep her apart from Mahiro, even threatening to burn him into ash at one point.

There is no plot or I just forgot it. The anime itself does not even care.This is a comedy anime, I know, but the comedy aspect could be better. It is FULL of references and nothing out of their own creation. Even tho I know for sure I could not catch about 80% of the references, you can just tell they just didnt do it themselves. I just think it is too much of  a multi-parody, and it never stops.I\'m sorry if you think...this is not helpful or that I just straight up hate on the anime.

All the good series that people recommend or consider amazing have been seen by me over these past 2-3 years. There\'s a bunch of good anime this season but that\'s once a week so when I saw this series I decided to give it a shot.Story: The story revolves around a young boy who is being targeted by monsters in order to become a slave to be traded by an intergalaxy agency of criminals.

It\'s similar to Sora No Otoshimono which the style of artwork I like.Sound: Hmm I only watched the OP for maybe 10 sec. It seemed upbeat and spunky which is nice. Didn\'t really pull me in like certain other OP (Angel beats for instance)Characters: The characters are nice. Our male protagonist doesn\'t act like the typical male that doesn\'t show any romantic emotions towards the females who are attracted to him (he at least thought she was cute and blushed, etc).All in all it seems like this is a cute like comedy show with a hint of romance here and there.

Beyond that, a handful of references and a couple gags relating to the dice and paper RPG are all that tie this into the mythos at all. It\'s funny, kind of twisted, but overall nothing special, yet another cute romantic comedy with a harem theme based around a normal everyday teenage boy who...is pulled into a fantastic situation that results in him being involved with cute girls that all end up part of his daily life in some way for the rest of the show. Also, like most harem anime, he is some kind of super being with a freakish level of willpower, just like the main character of every damn harem anime, because he refuses to give into his desires and have any kind of intimate contact with any of the multiple very attractive women literally climbing naked into his bed at every opportunity. I swear Japan has the weirdest ideas about teenage boys and the kind of restraint they are capable of. Inhuman. These kids could put Buddhist monks to shame.But yah, the jokes here are a little more to my liking than most being somewhat more ""edgy"" than your average fan service driven romantic comedy. It\'s one of the first to have a very well integrated gay theme on the harem side of things that gets actual consideration rather than just being a joke character thats immediately shot, beaten, or thrown out the moment they show up and make a pass at the male lead. This one gets some cute awkward ""what if"" moments and generally gets as much care and attention from the main character as the female options.

Nyaa~! Uu~! Nyaa~! Uu~! Nyaa~! (dun-dun-da-dunn) Let\'s Nyaa~!Er-herm....First off I just want emphasize that the nature of the show makes reviewing it difficult. Enjoyment of it is highly subjective to the viewer so please take that into account.Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is a comedic parody on a rampage. It\'s essentially the epitome of mindless entertainment with consistent gags, references, and over-used humor. It has a very clear audience: people with significant history and interest in anime. Outside of this group, the quality of show will likely be lost. With humor also being a subjective quality, appreciation (or lack thereof) of Haiyore varies from person to...person, so it\'s not for everyone. This is a show geared towards those with more extensive histories in anime due to the sheer volume of references crammed into each episode. Personally, I don\'t have that great a history and many of these blew right past me. That said, almost everything is constructed from parody, meaning that aside from the characters themselves and the basic plot line, there is almost no original content within Haiyore. You could even go as far to saying figuring out all of the references in each episode is a game since there are so many. I believe there are several dozen in the first episode alone.What little story there is comes from the Cthulhu Mythos written by H. P. Lovecraft. The various events that take place loosely stem from the various deities portrayed within the Mythos. I have not read these stories so I cannot comment on how connected they really are, however. Little focus is placed on the story but it serves as possibly the only thing to keep the events from rocketing off into deep space.The characters are what makes the show entertaining. Despite a lack of significant development, each have defined personalities which promote the wacky humor present in Haiyore. The story\'s hero, Mahiro Yasaka, appears to be an ordinary school boy but is thrown into a chaotic situation. Forcibly placing herself beside him is the extremely energetic and upbeat Nyarlathotep (""Nyaruko""). She one of the many ""Great Ones"" from the Mythos sent to protect Mahiro, though there are ulterior motives behind her appearance. Think of the two of them as a parody on the generic romance genre relationships, but with insanity thrown in. To top of the trio of main characters is Cthuko (""Kuuko Cthugha""). Sworn enemy of Nyaruko by virtue of their heritage, she is beyond smitten with her, much to Nyaruko\'s displeasure. Though these characters don\'t develop much, they are enjoyable by virtue of their various antics.With little focus on the development of story and characters, the artwork and audio received more attention. The artwork is appealing and smooth throughout, with scenery covering a vast range of areas. I wont say where though, that would spoil some of the fun. Each of the main characters has a defining design, well except for Mahiro since he\'s just an ordinary boy. With aliens present, expect some funky looking characters scattered about, but they\'re nothing displeasing. I enjoyed how they designed each character and animated them. The audio keeps pace with the non-serious nature of the show, though remains appropriate for each situation. I greatly enjoyed the opening song as well, if you can\'t tell with the start of this review. I have no qualms with the visual/audio aspects.If you\'re looking for a one word summation of Haiyore, it would have to be chaos. Chaotic turns are everywhere. Haiyore is meant to be watched with your brain turned off. It\'s nothing amazing and enjoyment ranges dramatically from person-to-person. If you\'re someone who enjoys gag-related humor, parodies of shows you\'ve previously watched, and nonsensical progression, you fit right into the niche of Haiyore. If you fall outside this niche, I would be hesitant to watch it as you\'ll likely miss where the entertainment value is coming from.Thanks for reading my review of Haiyore!, Nyaruko-san.

Thanks again!', ""After reading many of these reviews, or quickly scanning them, I realized there really wasn't a middle ground - you either loved it or hated it. And it seems to me most people wanted to hate something like this. But maybe both sides are missing the point: after all, for the people who want to bury this in the ground: lower your sophisticated and urbane shields for a second and try to understand WHY this anime wasn't deep or anything. And for the people who think this is flawless, it isn't. But perhaps I should make a stand here and try to look at BOTH...sides of the issue.Story: 6/10Alright, so the story was complete trash. But that's because it's a PARADY of a serious anime; after all, every huge fight and build up turned into something comedic. But that was the point. This wasn't supposed to be some deep, symbolic story where you'll fall to your knees, begging God or Zeus for forgiveness; no, it was supposed to be funny, to blow it off as if nothing. But that doesn't mean it was good, either. It was annoying, really, to have such intergalactic conflicts blown off as trivial. I mean honestly, give me one good villain! Perhaps the story arc, bland and straight as an arrow, could have been reworked to include elements to give the story, well, a story to follow and hold on to. But for whatever reason they didn't. Eh.Art: 8/10Obviously, this is where the production costs went. The artwork was flawless. Almost. The environments were kinda....bland. There were certain times, when the story LOOKED like it was going somewhere, when the artwork excelled - but most of the time, it was flat and, well, nothing special. But the characters were drawn nice, and everything seemed cutsey and too good to be true kind of drawings. The aliens and monsters were nicely drawn as well, but once again, nothing special. So, I'll give it a decent score.Sound: 8/10I'm not going to berate the sound either. It was actually quite good. The theme song was typical of comedic animes, catchy and, well, funny. The background music at critical times wasn't the typical orchestra, but opera-sounding voices, which was a nice deviation from the typical drum rolling and whatnot. But here, everything seemed to be in order. So, this deserves a decent score as well.Character: 6/10They really shouldn't have messed this up. I would have forgiven the studio for the lack of storyline, but you can't have static, stereotypical, almost perfectly archetypal characters that bore the audience. I mean come on, have SOME character change in some way. And really. Take out these lovey-dovey characterizations of Nyaruko and Ctchuko. I was intrigued, though, when these Greek references to gods and stuff were first introduced; but Hasta don't act like no God of Wind all the time. Sigh. And a tsundere as a main character: where haven't I seen THAT before? It wasn't awful, though, because there was SOME development, albeit almost nonexistant. But it wasn't there.Overall: 7/10Ok, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't stellar, either. Where does that put us? Somewhere in the middle. It was entertaining, but not particularly engaging either. The rewatch value would be extremely low and I would not recommend this to other people when asked to name a few anime, but that doesn't mean to completely skip it, either. It was entertaining, and funny. But I cringed several times where I shouldn't have, and certain points....well, I'll stop there. Don't completely discount this anime, though, because of the reviews, nor go into it with a heart of gold - keep a cautious distance, but don't be shy in embracing what this anime has to offer.

Oh, and Merry Christmas!"", ""Mythology. Something that you don’t see everyday in anime. But I came across it in so many places, hence I would give it a try. Well, before I watched the anime, I always replayed its opening song because it was awesome.The anime, produced by XEBEC, starts with the meeting between Mahiro, a normal high school boy, and Nyaruko, a Nyarlathotepian (or alien). She was sent into Earth by an organisation to protect Mahiro from aliens that lurked in this planet. As it progresses, more characters are introduced, be it with the pair or against them.The story has some funny moments. You ain’t looking at an...ordinary heroine, but a crazy one. The one who obsess with anime and manga, not as someone who is serious to follow commands. That makes the anime good, in the sense of comedy. Fan-service is spread in these twelve episodes and they are not very excessive.With mythology as a theme to the story, there isn't really much talk about myths. Don’t expect a lengthy explanation about each creatures, otherwise go to Wikipedia and do your own research.There are quite a number of battles, meaning good potential action. I would say that most of them are interesting. The rest fell short for its repetition. Even after a few episodes, the story’s quality started to decline for its low action but again peaked again after a while.There are a lot of references, mostly coming from anime and manga. I managed to pick a few but I didn’t care much. There is some romance too, which isn’t fully developed. Think of it as one-way. I actually think there’s a harem Mahiro has. hehe…Sometimes, drama can seep in, especially the last episode. But usually it can be broken off into comedy, which I am not happy about. Therefore, if you are looking for a serious story, I’m afraid this anime is not for you. I guess it is good for chuckles only.The characters aren’t very special. Mahiro is someone who doesn’t like a particular person and tries to avoid that person. Nyaruko is someone who wants to be attached to another particular person. This cat-and-mouse relationship has really never changed throughout the story, but there is some development in both characters.Their other friends are Kuuko, who loves Nyaruko a lot by some weird reason, Hasuta, who looks like a girl but is really a boy, and Kurei, who is the gossiper of their class. Not much character development is seen in these three, but they are adapted to what has been going in.The art is nice. I find the opening and ending animations very cute. The scenery is good-looking, especially on places where aliens frequent on Earth, as it gives a different look outside the human world. The character designs are well-down and facial expressions can be both cute and nice. I like how the scenes change as a battle is about to start. The action animation is great.I really can’t stop listening to the opening song the moment I started playing it. It has some nice beats to get your body moving. It sounds like you want to dance. Meanwhile, the ending song has a different approach, and it really bored the heck out of me, honestly. The background music is nice and the voice acting is great. There are certain voice actors recognisable from their other characters, like Nyaruko, who is voiced by Kana, who voices Hinata and Komari.In the end, I enjoyed it for a while, until the part where there’s little action. I wished it could have gotten better, and if I were to remove these anime and manga references, and change Nyaruko’s personality, I think the anime can be more interesting. I will still watch the second season and see how it goes.Don’t take this anime too seriously. Watch it and laugh.(And I don't see any bad reviews at all. About two reviews received a rating of 3 and I totally respect their decision.) ordinary heroine, but a crazy one. The one who obsess with anime and manga, not as someone who is serious to follow commands. That makes the anime good, in the sense of comedy. Fan-service is spread in these twelve episodes and they are not very excessive.With mythology as a theme to the story, there isn't really much talk about myths. Don’t expect a lengthy explanation about each creatures, otherwise go to Wikipedia and do your own research.There are quite a number of battles, meaning good potential action. I would say that most of them are interesting. The rest fell short for its repetition. Even after a few episodes, the story’s quality started to decline for its low action but again peaked again after a while.There are a lot of references, mostly coming from anime and manga.

Nyaruko-San!By Bobjonez98Story: 6/10-This is a tough one, the longest arc lasts maybe 3 episodes and the rest are either 1 or 2 episodes long. But the shorter arcs are actually the more entertaining ones. The story revolves around Nyaruko, who has come to earth to protect Mahiro from the evil deities of the Cthulu Mythos, hilarity ensues as anime is the only world where a Cthulu can become a bespectacled, green-haired cute anime girl.Characters: 8/10-Nyaruko is spunky, jumpy, head-over-heels in love, and that special breed of adorable/annoying. Some of her antics make her a little difficult to swallow, but she\'s still...quite likable. Kuuko, the quiet, lustful redhead and Hastur, the girlish young wind boy add a few unconventional relationship paradigms. Overall, the characters are likeable enough, they make for good, over-the-top comedy, and interesting interactions.Animation: 8/10-With lots of fight sequences, energetic character jumps and motions, there are a lot of opportunities for the animation quality to shine. It\'s a tad dark at times, but never for very long. The depictions of most of the Cthulu deities are faithful, except for the ones that have been made into cute girls and boys.Op/Ed: 7/10|6/10-The opening to me at least sounds like a late 80\'s American cartoon mystery show. It makes an attempt to be catchy and upbeat, but the choices in key and beat make it hard to sound bouncy and upbeat. Overall though, it\'s still pretty good. The ending is unremarkable, the accompanying animation is good, but it seems to be your standard harem series ending affair.Music: 7/10-For Monaca, this seems a bit sub par. Monaca usually has the magic to work a few memorable tunes into my head, but I honestly can\'t give you any. The battle music serves merely as a background, and the airy conversational tunes seem to disappear into the sky. They\'re there, and they provide good ambiance, but they\'re just not memorable like they are in Working!! or the Monogatari Series.Overall: 6/10-This is a very difficult series to give an overall score to. It doesn\'t meet my criteria for a 7, and it suffers from the same flaws as most of the series I have given 6s to. It has an uncanny quality to make you want to keep watching, just to see what happens next, but it isn\'t as substantial a series as I would like. I feel like I should probably mention the anime references. Throughout the course of the series, in several scenes, nods are given to a MULTITUDE of other series/games/ pop culture phenomena. To name a few: Pokemon, Final Fantasy, Left 4 Dead, The World God Only Knows, Haruhi, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, Back to the Future, Digimon, Working, Umi no Misaki, Please Teacher, One Piece, Bleach, Naruro, Dragon Ball Z, any magical girl series, Star Wars, And Code Geass.

There seemed to be a lot of great possibilities they could have brought into play.  Ancient deity, actually an alien, many different aliens, etc...That they ended up following the path they did was bewildering to say the least.  I was seriously disappointed in the lack of building up of the main character Mahiro.  So little is known about this character by the end of the series - he had great potential...and it was never explored.What I thought was fantastic about this series is the voice acting of Nyaruko!  What a breath of fresh air to have a female lead who is so over the top and so much fun!  Her acting alone has made me give this series a higher score than it really deserved.All in all - it's fun - there's a few laughs here and there (more during the 1st 1/2 of the series) - but you'll forget the story line mere hours after finishing the series. and it was never explored.What I thought was fantastic about this series is the voice acting of Nyaruko!

You'll get a few laughs, however the anime kinda dulls down from episode 5 and on but comes back in episode 7. Still it can't hurt to watch it once in a while. "", 'This is a review from a person who has not seen the rest of the Haiyore! series.I\'ve noticed other reviews with reference to them, and since I have yet to see them, I\'m just going to do a Raw Review. Anyway, you don\'t really have to have watched the others to understand this.Initially, Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is about an alien (later to develop into a group of aliens) disguising herself(themselves) as humans to protect earth. Although this may make it seem to be an anime based on the supernatural and alien-like, it\'s not.Hayore! Nyaruko-san is more focused on the daily life of our male protagonist while...trying to adapt to his unwanted distractions. Hayore!\'s plot-line is very Harem-like, as there are three characters that share a (weird) relationship with our main man. (They share a house too!) Although you can\'t really call it much of a Harem. (you\'ll see once you watch at least half of it..)The plot though is very loosely tied. It does\'nt really have much of a story-line. So it\'s not really a serious anime. There will be times when you may get tired of watching it too. The anime is focused more on Comedy, so expect a lot of that.The art is more on the ""moe"" side, so expect a lot of ""Kawaii!!!"" moments. It also offers a colorful background and a very nice array of colors through the different worlds. Although most of the times, the story takes the seriousness out of the area and just adds more comedy.All in all, Hayore! Hyaruko-san is definitely a must-watch to those who want a comedic, lighthearted anime which doesn\'t need much brain power to comprehend... Except maybe the Space CQC thing, which totally takes away the ""close quarters"" in ""close quarter combat"" trying to adapt to his unwanted distractions.

Once you watch the anime you will understand, why this may be problematic and begin to enjoy it to it's fullest.The main female voice acting is just superb, and is the main reason you will watch this show. Sure it is quirky, at times stupid, but in the end it is just pure entertainment and fun.

Two episodes was all I could manage, and I\'m surprised with myself that I didn\'t stop at the first. Therefore this is a brief review.To begin with, the initial concept is great. Nyarlathotep, the crawling chaos, servant of Azathoth, transforms into a little anime girl. Great start. That\'s why I watched this in the first place. It seems like it would appeal to a fan like me. However, everything went downhill after that.Now, Nyarlathotep was a unique entity in the Lovecraft mythos. Attempting to create an established race out of...the shapeshifter is a bold move to say the least. As far as Nyaruko\'s personality goes, while it is true that Nyarlathotep was a fair bit more sociable and scheming than the other Outer Gods, it was by no means a ditz. From this, and from the depictions of Night-gaunts (they\'re supposed to be dead silent!) and Shantak-birds.  it was clear that the creator (creators?) only had a surface-level knowledge of Lovecraft. Whether this was due to laziness or availability of the stories is unknown to me.It\'s not like the non-Lovecraft parts are any better. That weak-ass fight (complete with Pokemon reference) was equal parts not funny and boring. The slice-of-life aspect is probably the strongest of them all, but if I wanted good gimmick-less high school anime I have plenty of those to choose from.I may be a sperg for getting picky about source material and giving this such a low score, but when I hear the phrase ""Lovecraft anime"", I expect a bit more. I\'ll keep my eyes peeled should anything of similar concept appear in the future. the shapeshifter is a bold move to say the least.

Nyaruko-san WSTORYHaiyore! Nyaruko-san is a take on the Lovecraftian myths mixed with your usual ecchi harem setting. The outcome is strange, to say the least.The protaganist is Mahiro Yasaka a cardboard-cutout, self-inserting relationship oblivious high school boy who stumbles into a world of magical crap. Sound familiar? It is. The real personalities of the show are the three side characters, all based off of Cthulu mythos malign deities.Nyaruko is the personification of the outer god Nyarlathotep. She comes to Earth on a mission to save Mahiro, and subsequently falls...in love wit him. She also has one of the longest ahoge I have ever seen.Secondly is Cthuko, the red headed Cthughan who is love with Nyaruko for whatever reason, however eventually she understands the point of a harem and starts going after Mahiro too.Finally is the god of wind, Hastur, who's chosen form is an adrogenous boy with hair that looks like a beetle. He is also officially classed as a whiny shit. He looks up to Mahiro for tripping him up or something. Literally no one likes him, not even his own family.There are also quite a few side characters ranging from Mahiro's Mum who turns out to be a monster hunter, a shit 'childhood friend' trope character and a space bat that can turn into a 10 year old girl.Most episodes are isolated , with the staus quoue being reestablished at the end of each episode. Every single arc seems to go like this: SoL shenanigans for 10 mins, an alien is invading Earth or some shit and everything is serious, the only way to stop them is to throw powerlevels at eachother in an over the top fight scene while Mahiro comes along and does nothing except get in the way, it turns out the villian's motivation was really stupid and there wasn't anything to worry about anyway and so everyone goes back home and tries to have sex with Mahiro. There you go, no need to watch it, that's what happens.PRODUCTIONOverall the quality of the animation was decent, as long as no one moved. Most of the action sequences happened when the writer's seemed to be getting bored of a serious plotline, and so, to fit in with the ridiculous situation, the animation was bad. However this didn't seem too bad, because it fits with the series' tone. Kudos to Xebec, the studio that always seems to make sub-par animation seem bareable.On the other hand, the soundtrack was amazing. With a relatively small number of tracks, all were very well made and fitting to an adaptation of the Cthulu mythos. Also both OPs, entitled 'I want a gay Horse' and 'Sons of Bitches', are some of the catchiest songs ever made.CONCLUSIONOverall I recommend skipping this show. It has it's highlights but is a pretty meh show in general. The story is generic, the story pacing was awful and the entire thing is drenched in references, most of which no one got. I would recommend watching the first OP and first episode, followed by the second OP and then nothing more. Also, as is with most harem anime, nobody wins, which is always annoying. However, if you are really into the whole Cthulu mythos, then ignore this show entirely, except for character names, there are no similarities what so ever.Also remember that Xebec made Love Hina and you should watch that because it's good(ish).METALength- \t2 cours / 24 eps / 9.6 hrsRelease-\tSpring 2012 & Spring 2013Studio-\tXebecSource-\t2009 LN by Manta Aisora / 1928 Novel by HP LovecraftAlts-\t\tOVA / 2x Manga / OVA / GameRATINGWatch?-\t\t\tNoBest Character-\tNyarukoWorst Character-\tHastaBest Feature-\t\tBoth OPs in love wit him.

About 1.5 - 2 years ago i dropped this show because she was SO ANNOYING. It was painfull to watch most of the time because of her, and it was also painful to watch it again when i decided to try and watch it again.The way i see the story(might be wrong but i don't care), it isn't really a story at all... it's mostly funny gags that...are somewhat enjoyable from time to time. There isn't really much progress other than introdusing a few new characters. But since some of the gags are fun, i'll give a 4I really like the art... It is good. Not the best but it's close. That's why i give 8.I also like the soundtrack, but i like most soundtracks so i doesn't really say much, but i'll give it a 7.As i said earlier, Nyaruko pretty much ruined a lot for me. I simply don't like her character. Sure she can be cute sometimes but there is a limit to how much i can handle a character being so annoying. The other characters is easier to deal with since they are not as crazy as Nyaruko, but you have to decide that yourself, since there is a lot of mixed feelings to the characters. So characters gets 4.Also, MC-kun is a male Tsundere :3. that's kind of refreshing, i dunno why.So, did i enjoy Haiyore! Nyaruko-san? Well, not as much as i would want. But it has some good points that are enjoyable. And i probably would like it more if Nyaruko wasn't so god damn annoying all the time.6/10. Now i have to survive the second season.... Sigh...

Nyaruko is madly in love with, and possibly insane, Mahiro, who couldn't care less about her and constantly points out discontinuities in the show (breaking the fourth wall).

The song is catchy, and the story arcs are all entertaining. Enjoy your watch!"", 'I have only seen two episodes of this anime. Here\'s the story of how I got into this anime and why I decided to drop it.I first got into this anime after hearing that it makes a lot of anime references. I thought, ""This could be fun!"" and had fun watching the first episode. Then, I get to episode two and there was a particular scene I did not approve of.Here\'s what happens, Nyaruko, the female protagonist runs into an old enemy of hers (who\'s name I can\'t remember) whom she hasn\'t seen in quite a while. Just when Nyaruko is ready to...fight her, she unexpectedly confesses that she has a very large sexual crush on Nyaruko. She ties her up to her bed and start\'s kissing Nyaruko\'s crotch while she is screaming at her to stop. In other words, it\'s a rape scene.Personally, I get really annoyed whenever I see rape in anime, not only because I think it will put a bad influence on whoever watches it, but also because, to me, rape is seriously the worst possible thing you could do to a person, even worse than killing. If you are killed by someone, then unless ghosts are real, you only have that pain (physical and emotional) for a little bit. If you are raped, i.e. forced to be touched and kiss by someone you don\'t like, you are walking around with that pain for the rest of your life. Somehow, the Japanese find suffering like this to be entertaining, and I cannot understand why.I get especially annoyed whenever I see homosexual rape in anime, like this one. It has been mythologized for a very long time in western culture (I do not know if it\'s the same in Japanese culture. If someone can clarify that for me, it would be very much appreciated.) that gay people are rapists. All they live for is to have sex with people of their gender, even if that person isn\'t queer. Whenever I see rape in anime between two boys or two girls, that\'s the first thing that comes to mind, which is why I can\'t stand most yaoi like Junjou Romantica. fight her, she unexpectedly confesses that she has a very large sexual crush on Nyaruko.

This show likes to take the piss out of the common Harem and crappy high school story genre.A show that is similar in terms of how the show treats itself is Renai Boukun. While i did actually like that show compared to others opinion of it. This is probably a better show in terms of how it handles itself. With Renai Boukun it could seem unfocused or lost in where...it's going. This on the other hand knows what it wants to do it seems.Only real complaints are four and you could say that they are just personal opinion so they don't really matter in a actual review.1. The Harem. While i know that it's a harem story to make fun of them. It doesn't change my opinion that harems are annoying and can ruin stories. Parodies no exception.2. The MC could be pretty annoying at times like most shows of this genre. I kind of want to hope the creators purposely made him like that to mimic others shows with crappy MC's but i doubt it.3. I feel that if the story was focused around Nyaruko as the MC and not the boy in this that it may have been a better story. I really like the relationship between Nyaruko and Cthuko and they're also my shipped couple of the series.4. The weird trap ... Nough saidWhile those are my complaints there are things that i did really like. Such as how they don't just focus on one bad guy all through out the series. Most bad guys will only last 1 or 2 episodes. Having long story archs in things like a parody show can be annoying.Two episodes i really liked that were back to back were when the MC and Nyaruko switched bodies. I don't know why but i just felt that the two of them are better suited in each others bodies ( Yes i know how wrong that sounds) With how this story is i wouldn't be surprised if it ended the season with the two of them still not in their own bodies. The personalities really just fit well in the other character. Especially the MC in Nyaruko's body.Overall a really fun story to just have some good laughs. it's going.

Nyaruko-san. Subject was then told to give his thoughts. The following is a transcript of his thoughts on this anime.Purpose: To understand why anime of the “Harem” genre turn him into a raging lunatic. The results will be used to decide in what sector of the asylum to place him.Transcript: I can’t believe I just sat through twelve episodes of this underwhelming, clichéd, and uninteresting mess of an anime. And it’s not like this anime didn’t have the chance to do something other than be a...load of crap. It had an interesting idea in using Lovecraft lore in the plot. In fact, that was the best part of the series was when it embraced its inspiration. But after maybe two episodes of embracing the inspiration, it throws it away and instead has the occasional reference that only fans of Lovecraft could catch. “Hahaha, she mentioned The Rats in the Walls! That’s funny!” Or sometimes it’s more in your face, as if it needs to remind us that this is in no way just a generic piece of crap that has a decent enough idea behind it, but would rather throw that away to fit in with the rest of the harem crowd. “My bikini says Lovecraft! Because you probably forgot this had to do with Lovecraft lore and not tits and sexual references!” If this anime got rid of the Lovecraft references and inspiration and instead replaced it with aliens or demons or anything else from the harem anime genre, it would be the same fucking thing. Way to use the one decent thing you had going for you. Nope, got to get those beach and body swap episodes in instead of doing something new and innovative.But hey, Haiyore! has cute girls. And that’s the only good thing about this load of smelly squid monster shit. The only reason I kept coming back to watch it was because I was susceptible to the wiles of the adorable Kuuko and Nyarko. And I mean, they aren’t even that great in the character department. But they have good design and I feel bad that I was put under the animators spell. It shows I’m still just a horny little teenaged boy. And of course Kuuko had to be a lesbian which makes things even better. You know, it’s pretty fucking bad when the only thing I can say about this show is: I watched it in the vague hope of seeing Kuuko make out with Nyarko.I mean, this anime, as I said, started with some good ideas behind it. Sure it was cute girls embodying horrible monsters that could make you go insane, but it had this whole Lovecraft world and I wanted to experience lots of that. It had lots of references to anime and Lovecraft! THERE WAS A FUCKING REFERENCE TO THE CALL OF CTHULU ROLE PLAYING GAME FROM THE EIGHTIES! I mean, I could laugh at these smart references! But then Kuuko joined the party. Then Hasuta. And then it was just a big harem and it was boring and uninteresting and uninspired and…FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!And don’t even get me started on the random loli that shows up at the door. Holy fuck was she cute! But holy crap was I groaning! I figured she was okay and wasn’t going to join the party, instead hanging around as a plot point. But instead, at the end, she says she wants to marry our main character, Mahiro! Mahiro is a fucking vagina magnet (well…and a penis magnet…a genital magnet) and he’s a terrible character! He sucks! He’s an asshole! You have a girl throwing herself at you and you won’t even kiss her? Sure she’s a horrible tentacle monster on the inside, but don’t listen to your parents! It’s not about what’s on the inside, it’s about what’s on the outside! His nightmare is kissing this poor tentacle monster from outer space! This girl just wants some loving! GIVE IT TO HER!Did I even mention anything about the plot? I am so scatterbrained right now because I have no idea how to talk about how bad this is. I mean, it starts with these aliens coming to Earth because Earth is the universe’s porn hub. We have the best pornographic video games and comics. And apparently that’s a big thing in space. And this girl, Nyarko, gets to protect Mahiro and its ultra-exciting because she loves him! But he’s a tsundere douchebag! He tries to kill her with a fork at one point! GOD I HATE HIM!Did I mention that there are bad aliens who attack the Earth? Yeah, they turn the sky red and violet because that wasn’t annoying enough on Shakugan no Shana. And the fights are freaking lame. They are all uninteresting.Hell, that sums up the series. Uninteresting. I mean, you have the beach episode because you can’t have an anime without your characters in slutty swimsuits. Thankfully, Kuuko is conservative. But then again, there’s always that conservative school swimsuit girl. Speaking of which, there is a pool episode. And a body swap episode that is just creepy. I mean, I guess the part where Nyarko masturbates in Mahiro’s body was funny, but when she makes out with herself essentially, I was so creeped out.There was nothing interesting about the plot. Nothing about it was fun. I was bored! There was this guy who I guess was Nyarko’s brother, but he never shows up but for one episode. And there are only a few episodes where Nyarko and company fight aliens. The rest are just generic, conventional harem adventures.Can I please ask you this writers of harem light novels and anime…why are the main characters so unrealistic? If a real human were in the situation where three chicks want to fuck him, he wouldn’t cry about it, find it annoying, and wish them to Hell. HE’D FUCK THEM! You know why Japan’s birthrate is going down? Because Japanese boys watch this and learn a lesson: Neglect women because they are annoying and kissing them is horrible.The music is as conventional as everything else. The animation isn’t really that great. Characters do look absolutely cute and adorable up close, but from afar they look kind of weird.Did I mention Nyarko? I liked her. I felt for her! She likes this guy and he blows her off all the time. I mean, I know nothing about her character than she likes Mahiro and is loud. I’m sure there is more to her than that, but who knows? She’s too busy being his insane stalker. Kuuko kicks ass because she’s all quiet except when she can act lesbian with Nyarko. And she plays video games. She is the best character, as well as the funniest. Her utterance of the words “I’m wet” will forever stick with me and be a screencap I use forever; it was just that funny. And the loli was just…a loli. She didn’t have a lot of character. Though I do think Mahiro doesn’t like Nyarko because he is a lolicon. That whole shower scene and sleeping on the lap thing didn’t gel with me. That got a little creepy.And don’t forget that freaky Hasuta guy. Actually, let’s forget about him because there’s nothing memorable about him.I mean, I’m not as much mad because Haiyore! is shit as much as the untapped potential. It could have been a really good play on the mythology of Lovecraft, but is instead a harem anime with nothing to distinguish it from any other harem anime then the fact it kind of uses the Lovecraft lore a few times. I mean, it had some genuinely funny moments and I even found myself laughing at some of the stupid harem parts. But taken overall, it’s just not good. The only memorable part will be the cute girls. They are very distinguished from the rest of those girls in harem anime, but otherwise, nothing else is distinguished.Kuuko…oh Kuuko, thank you for being the one bright part of this shitfest. If you were not there to make me laugh, then I would probably have stuck my dick in a soda bottle full of lemon juice just to negate the pain.Diagnosis: After this review he proceeded to bang his head against the floor for an hour trying to forget ever watching this show while at the same time yelling Kuuko so he at least remembered her. In my professional opinion, he needs to be placed in solitary confinement and put in a straightjacket. It’s G-block for him. load of crap.

It\'s been over a year now and I still catch myself humming ""I wanna chaos"".Ok let us be clear: If you don\'t know who Lovecraft is, too bad. You might as well stop reading. If you don\'t like lolis, too bad, you might as well stop reading. If you don\'t like references well too f$%^ing bad. Stop reading.  Nyaruko-san takes the deities of the Cthulhu mythos and turns them into absolutely adorable lolis with questionable motives and morals. You have Nyarlathotep, turning into...Nyaruko, our female lead, who obsesses over our male lead, Mahiro, an average highschool boy. Then you have Cthuga, the fire-breathing deity, turned to Cthuko, a bisexual redhead madly (pun intended) in love with Nyaruko and also fancying a bit the protagonist. And lastly, (and let me take a big breath here), we have me, Hastur, the Lord of Carcosa, the Unspeakable One, the Wind of Death, portrayed as (sigh) an adorable blonde trap. Hasuta-kun, who\'s also in love with the protagonist. So basically you have 3 sex(and not only)-crazed aliens looking like lolis, making a sh£$load of references to pretty much everything, all trying to win over the straight man, Mahiro.The plot doesn\'t progress anywhere, nor does it intend to. The anime never takes itself seriously, and just keeps throwing jokes and references at us with an occasional romantic scene between nyaruko and Mahiro. Most episodes are one-shot stories with no connection to each other (other than the occasional reference), usually with an event foreshadowed at the start of the episode which leads to the climax and a gag near the end. Hell, from a point onward we see Mahiro and Nyaruko trying to find the foreshadows so that they know what to expect (yeah, Deadpool-like 4th wall jokes, legions of them).The animation is pretty good as far as comedies go (hell, maybe even needlessly so) and the design of the aliens is simply too cute (you\'ll end up loving Nyaruko even if she usually acts like a jerk. The sound is also surprisingly ok, with the voice actors being surprisingly not annoying when they\'re doing almost-intentionally-annoying voices (still can\'t figure that out, nyaruko\'s voice for example should definitely be annoying and yet it isn\'t).Reasons to watch:1)Plenty of brain-cell-killing humor.2)If you like the Cthulhu Mythos it\'s a must.3)References and more references and more references.4)The art is incredibly cute for the girls and the trap.5)It\'s a harem (kinda) anime without tsundere characters.6)Rediculously catchy opening songs for both the original series and W.7)Surprisingly romantic scenes thrown here and there.Reasons not to watch:1)They displayed me as a trap (write my name in reverse)...

Nyaruko-san is a parody anime.  Because of this, I thought the best way to review this is to reference as many things as I can in this one review.Story: The plot of this anime is pretty much, well, non-existent.  Think about ""Demon King Daimao"" and ""Angel Beats!"", and throw all of those somewhat plotless ideas away because there seriously is no plot to this.  In fact, it might very well be similar to ""Zero no Tsukaima"" and ""Shakugan no Shana"" because of the idea that there are many antagonists within the story that each get a sort of small...arc in a sense.  Also, think about ""To Love-Ru"" for the alien aspect.  The story revolves around a 17 year old named Mahiro who finds out that a cthulu life-form known as Nyarlathotep or Nyaruko for short has come and protect him from other alien life-forms from doing god knows what to him.  From then on, more cthulu-like creatures show up and hilarity ensues.Characters: Nyaruko, as the lead heroine, is a mix of Haruhi\'s enthusiasm, Konata\'s otakuness, Tomoyo\'s appearance, and Haruko Haruhara\'s insanity.  And possibly every single lovesick female that can exist in anime ever.  In short, she is an overly active silver-haired girl that can pretty much kick ass in any situation, proving to be truly the heart of this show, giving it its character.  She also possesses one of the largest ahoge\'s ever, which changes shape according to her mood, which is actually pretty funny.  Next, Mahiro.  Now, think of the most tsundere character you can think of, and multiply it by 3.  To put it short, Mahiro is one of the most tsundere characters you can ever meet.  As the main male, he has to put up with all of these antics that the freeloaders in his house come up with, resulting in some funny scenes that usually involve forks.  Yes, forks.  Next, Kuuko.  Kuuko can be considered as the sacred combination of origami and kotori from ""Date a live"", as well as Mafuyu from ""Seitokai no Ichizon.""  As an obsessive and borderless person, she constantly fawns over Nyaruko and loves playing video games.  And finally, Hastua.  Yes, I know there are more characters, but I just wanted to point out the main 4.  Hastua is the trap in the series and can be considered as a mix of a dandere character and Fuko from ""Clannad"".  Yes, it\'s a boy, accept it.  Though usually quiet, Hastua adds in as the shy one, eventually becoming more outgoing as the series goes.  Keep in mind that these characters are just one-sided.Art and Sound: As an art style, the characters look really well done and the animation is fluid.  The action scenes are pretty good as well and are well, random due to the circumstances the anime puts its action scenes in.  For sound, think of the most catchy and energetic soundtrack you can think of.  This will probably top that.  The OP is one of the catchiest and upbeat things to ever come out of anime.  As for the ending, the tone is still energetic, but a bit more toned down then the OP.Personal enjoyment: Now, for me, this can be considered as a guilty pleasure anime.  The way I see it, there are 2 love triangles in this anime, each of them revolving around the 4 main characters.  This anime, truly has something for everybody.  It has a slice of life feel, action, comedy, parody, harem, yaoi, yuri, ecchi, horror (only for one episode, sort of), mystery, etc.  Though this anime really has no plot, it\'s not supposed to.  People judge this anime for something it isn\'t.  It\'s supposed to be true mindless fun in the sense of testing one\'s otakuness.  They constantly break the fourth wall, which is hilarious, they constantly make references to things, this is that otaku test I was talking about, and they put it in the way that is just pure comedy.  However, it should be noted that this anime has an obsession with wanting to speed relationships up and make babies.  Seriously, not even kidding.  It seems as though that the characters really want to make children, and girl on girl and guy on guy apparently works to succeed this task.  There is also a massive amount of foreshadowing which is just slipped in so precariously, that the characters and the audience don\'t notice, creating some sort of scavenger hunt that makes this anime unique.  To put it simply, I love this anime and if anyone out there wants to watch something that takes your mind off of pretty much anything in life, then I would highly recommend watching this because there is nothing better then getting a smile on your face.  Until then, may the owner of the Wicked eye watch over you! arc in a sense.  Also, think about ""To Love-Ru"" for the alien aspect.

She also possesses one of the largest ahoge\'s ever, which changes shape according to her mood, which is actually pretty funny.  Next, Mahiro.  Now, think of the most tsundere character you can think of, and multiply it by 3.  To put it short, Mahiro is one of the most tsundere characters you can ever meet.  As the main male, he has to put up with all of these antics that the freeloaders in his house come up with, resulting in some funny scenes that usually involve forks.  Yes, forks.  Next, Kuuko.  Kuuko can be considered as the sacred combination of origami and kotori from ""Date a live"", as well as Mafuyu from ""Seitokai no Ichizon.""  As an obsessive and borderless person, she constantly fawns over Nyaruko and loves playing video games.  And finally, Hastua.  Yes, I know there are more characters, but I just wanted to point out the main 4.  Hastua is the trap in the series and can be considered as a mix of a dandere character and Fuko from ""Clannad"".  Yes, it\'s a boy, accept it.  Though usually quiet, Hastua adds in as the shy one, eventually becoming more outgoing as the series goes.  Keep in mind that these characters are just one-sided.Art and Sound: As an art style, the characters look really well done and the animation is fluid.  The action scenes are pretty good as well and are well, random due to the circumstances the anime puts its action scenes in.  For sound, think of the most catchy and energetic soundtrack you can think of.  This will probably top that.  The OP is one of the catchiest and upbeat things to ever come out of anime.  As for the ending, the tone is still energetic, but a bit more toned down then the OP.Personal enjoyment: Now, for me, this can be considered as a guilty pleasure anime.  The way I see it, there are 2 love triangles in this anime, each of them revolving around the 4 main characters.  This anime, truly has something for everybody.  It has a slice of life feel, action, comedy, parody, harem, yaoi, yuri, ecchi, horror (only for one episode, sort of), mystery, etc.  Though this anime really has no plot, it\'s not supposed to.  People judge this anime for something it isn\'t.  It\'s supposed to be true mindless fun in the sense of testing one\'s otakuness.  They constantly break the fourth wall, which is hilarious, they constantly make references to things, this is that otaku test I was talking about, and they put it in the way that is just pure comedy.  However, it should be noted that this anime has an obsession with wanting to speed relationships up and make babies.  Seriously, not even kidding.  It seems as though that the characters really want to make children, and girl on girl and guy on guy apparently works to succeed this task.  There is also a massive amount of foreshadowing which is just slipped in so precariously, that the characters and the audience don\'t notice, creating some sort of scavenger hunt that makes this anime unique.  To put it simply, I love this anime and if anyone out there wants to watch something that takes your mind off of pretty much anything in life, then I would highly recommend watching this because there is nothing better then getting a smile on your face.  Until then, may the owner of the Wicked eye watch over you!', ""I personally enjoyed this anime to an extent. I actually went into this blindly without any knowledge or expectations. It turned out to be a pretty funny rom-com with the exception of a few things.Plot: 7. I give it a 7 based on the fact that it does its job as a comedy. I mean there's some moments where there's mild drama or romance and then there's a load of gags that are humorous at most. The problem I had with this the most is that well, there really isn't any direction in this. It's basically one guy forcibly going on adventures with alien...girls. So basically, it's another rom-com harem.. must I say School Days (yes I thought it was funny, but annoying.) I digress, I personally thought it needed a direction instead of just one linear path of straight up funny innuendos.Art: Pretty nice, in 1080p that is >_> It's not outdated obviously and the characters don't have extremely outrageous eye sizes? I like the art, especially some scenes were nice.Sound: Good seiyuu and good sounds ++.Characters: The characters are likeable with the exception of that blonde kid who looked like a girl but actually is a guy who happens to go gay with the main character.

"", ""Some reviews are harsh, some are good, ad here is my piece of mind:  I like this anime. Granted it could ghave been a lot more, but as it is using the works of a Master Writer as H.P.

The use of such characters (Cthuga is very funny, and given its original being so much powerful and terrfic,...even more hilarious).As Lovecraft's work can be considered Science Fiction, the way it was parodied here is fantastic, and many parts are so much more funny if you know what and which stories its parodiy comes from.When I first knew what was the concept of this anime I was thrilled, and even though it is parody I laughed a lot.That being said, I also like strong female characters with resolution and decisiveness, and Nyaruko knows what she wants. The boy is your regular dork and waste his time refusing the adorable Nyaruko (aha, must have a reason for the gags, as her atempts are funny). Chthuga is funny, but I am not a fan of Yuri anyway, but she is ot the aggressive one against the male character as in other stories and that was refreshing.Of course they could have done much, much more with such an idea, but as this is a parody, then ok.I recomend it for its execution, art, music, and for its origial and daring concept!

I gave Nyaruko another chance in Nyaruko-san but I\'m sad to report that it still isn\'t that good. Nyaruko is about the not-so-ordinary slice-of-life story of Mahiro who, like in To LoveRu, finds a sudden instant-girlfriend in the form of a crazy alien, and soon finds himself in the middle of yet another harem. This light comedy differentiates itself in two ways. First, Nyaruko\'s personality and goal of protecting Mahiro and, really indirectly, the Earth as a galactic policeman makes...for an interesting premise. Second, the series makes use of lots of parodies of other anime series. While the second differentiation is interesting, it\'s not worth wading through a lot of bad plot to say ""oh, that was from Gundam OO... nice..."".Animation:The overall animation is not bad, especially considering that it isn\'t in Adobe Flash this time around. The overall coloring is nice, with some occasionally stellar backgrounds. As for character styling, Nyaruko has one crazy-large ahoge, which she can apparently control to make shapes and what not (though not to the extent of Yami in To Love-Ru). Some of the clothing (or lack thereof) is a bit odd but given they\'re aliens I guess it\'s okay? It seems alien-based series always need a mascot, this time in the form of a hippo-bat-bird chimera.Xebec\'s previous works include Kanokon, To LoveRu, Ladies vs Butlers, and MM! thus you can expect that there will be substantial fan service. Much of it is in the form of intentional ecchi similar to that found in Kanakon, though there is also a strong emphasis on yuri elements- and you have Hasuta, a guy who wants to have Mahiro\'s baby, if that makes any sense to you... There is some action involved, but I found it to be average harem quality, i.e. nothing to be impressed with.Sound:Immediately, the OP announces the seriousness of the series with a bunch of ""Ooh~ Nyaa!""s. It\'s a playful but melodically uninspiring piece, though playing the first part at 0.5x speed makes for some good chuckles. The ED feels like the complete opposite of the OP, a very calm and conservative piece. BGM is fairly plain with one weird chant piece used repeatedly throughout.VA-wise, Kana Asumi did a great job giving Nyaruko a uniquely outgoing personality. Eri Kitamura also, again, demonstrates her unfathomable range as Mahiro; definitely a pretty convincing guy voice. The others were a mix as I found Rie Kugimiya a weird fit for Hasuta.Story:There\'s two ways you can look at the story here, from the innovative parody angle and from the lethargic plot angle.From the parody angle, this series is pretty entertaining. You can easily find over a dozen parodies in this show ranging from Haruhi to Half Life to The God Only Knows. I\'ll let you find some of the other ones but do note that it covers a surprisingly broad spectrum of anime and production companies.Unfortunately, the bare bones plot used to create these parody situations was pretty pitiful. You are presented with a handful of antagonists to move the story along, and they are laughably bad at best. The series is pretty arc-based, building (barely) to a final climax and likewise bare bones resolution. Though the show occasionally moves quickly and sometimes ends on cliffhangers, there are also many conversation points at which one could easily fall asleep. As Nyaruko is 1000% committed to Mahiro, there never feels like there is any real tension or risk- leading to my overall apathy towards the plot.For me, the plot had the greater impact of the two and as stated already, it\'s not really worth it just for the parodies. So what about the characters?Character:There\'s a handful of primary and supporting characters, which can easily be bucketed as harem members and the rest, respectively. The series does try to be different by having homosexual tendencies but you never really get anything meaningful as Mahiro is just your standard, indecisive and weak male lead- though he actually does seem to be more rude than the typical nice guy. In the end, the only meaningful character is Nyaruko, who shows her devotion in a very Kanakon fashion, though with additional flair and Super-Sentai-ish body movements. Unfortunately, even with Nyaruko, all the relationships in this series are static- no one really develops at all.Value:This series deserves credit for pulling together so many parodies from such a breadth of genres. However, it walks a very well-treaded path in all other categories resulting in a standard, if not sub par, addition to the over-crowded slice of life, comedic harem genre. In retrospect, To Love-Ru offers a more progressive plot and richer character development with a fairly similar premise. Is this a show to watch?

Nyaruko-san - A Review as dry as the gin I drink while watching this.---------Phew, so this is my first review. And I picked Nyarko-san of all shows to start? Why?The reason is simple - among all shows I have watched so far, this one has stood out to me for its remarkable intensity.Intensity in what? Brutal comedy! Lack of dignity! Shameless reference-hogging! Self-awareness! But most of all, confidence.The people behind this show probably knew what they were creating here, and had way too much fun making it.I won\'t repeat the plot and setting here, MAL got you covered.As an aside, the OP...of this show is so immensely anime that I would show it to anyone who needs a lesson on what this medium can come down to.A) What I expected when going into this show: (backstory, expectations, predisposition)I first stumbled upon this gem of a show when doing my routine stroll through crunchyroll\'s sidebar list of anime to find something extraordinary.Upon first sight, a heartfelt laugh escaped by chest - All my alarm bells for ""Gimmicky show"" were ringing at full volume.An anthropo-comedy show, I was sure of it. But with a lovecraftian god (and Nyarlathotep of all!) as the main chick? I was BEYOND sceptical about the quality of this idea.Apart from that basic info (which made the show seem painfully generic and at the same time highly interesting), I had no ideas as to what i should expect.The pictures on MAL and CR were too incongruous with my idea of a show featuring old-school horror.As an aside, I watched Blend S before this show (I did NOT like it), and had a predisposition to thinking that nothing could possibly have less dignity than that show.If you can\'t tell yet, I\'m not a fan of useless fanservice.B) What the viewing experience is like:It\'s like nothing I\'ve seen so far. There are lots of shows which people recommend you to ""turn your brain off"" to;This notion always struck me as odd, but now I understand it all too well.You cannot watch Nyarko-san without sacrificing some sanity. In that sense, it is quite a subtle application of lovecraftian psychology/horror.Sure, it doesn\'t SCARE you to insanity, but it sure drives up a wall! The show constantly fulfills every cliché expectations you might have, and goes even beyond.It indulges in its craziness, grabs you by the hand and doesn\'t let it go until you have lost either your virginity, your temper or your sanity.The only way you can enjoy the show is to accept it as what it is, and not question the premise, the execution, or...basically anything.How does this craziness manifest itself?Hyperactivity of the plot; Nothing stands still for even a second.References to anime and gaming culture as well as Lovecraft\'s works that bear no impact on the plot 50% of the time and are clearly there to entertain the knowledgeable viewers.Shameless fanservice and harem tropes. Yes. This is a harem.(As if there were a way to avoid this nowadays >.>) I have to admit, this show is as close to an ecchi as you can possibly go without it being categorised as such.Prepare yourself for the most thirsty aliens you have seen in media, as well as a mother that loves her son maybe a bit too much.C) What I think this show excels at:Nyarko-san is a rare case of ""Terrible concept - brilliant execution"". The creators of this show knew that there was nothing serious they could make of this setting,and thus they went for the complete opposite - total, utter absurdity.The pacing of the show leaves no gaps to be bored. Every shot shows something interesting or relevant to the plot, and rarely is there a moment where you are let off the hook.Even though the humour might not be of your taste, its comedic timing is spot on. This is a rare sight nowadays, and really makes this show enjoyable when you find value in its brand of wish-fulfillment, absurd humour.Its references range from everything in between Pokemon and obscure shows you probably haven\'t heard about. (Pop team epic, anyone?)As an interesting aside: The show seems to give off a strong vibe that the video game obsession most of the characters have is reflective of the creators. I think it\'s telling that this show has more actual gamers in it than Gamers!.Another facette of this execution is the way the plot is constructed long-term: There is no real overarching structure to it, but a (very predictable) and elaborate plan to increase the shenanigan density overall.As soon as the dynamics between the current characters could start getting out of hand or stale, the show introduces a twist to make up for it. Be it a new character that breaks the symmetry of the love triangle (rectangle? pentagram?)or just a plain ol\' body swap -  Nyarko-san never fails to deliver the kind of entertainment that keeps you on your toes, whether you like it or not.There is also (for this kind of show seemingly out-of-place) foreshadowing and adherence to Chekov\'s gun. In particular, a certain gimmicky charm comes to mind as being useful again and again in vital moments of the show.On that note, an honourable mention is the *perfection* with which the main chick, Nyarko-san, is executed. She is possibly the most annoying, hyperactive, clingy, perverted love interest that a teenage boy could dream of, and as such fills her role spot on.She reacts to everything, forces the main character into the most embarrassing situations and literally wants his babies more than anything. The show pulls no breaks in characterising her as the most inhumanly obsessive lover you could imagine.Which...sounds annoying and unrealistic at first...until you realise it.This is genius. She\'s a lovecraftian god. OF COURSE she\'s inhuman! Of course she is destroying the sanity of both the main character and the viewer! Of course the stunts of absurd, meta comedy she pulls are seemingly out-of-the-blue.The seemingly pointless idiocy of the characters and plot shit actually serves to provide a lovecraftian horror that is not scary, but endearing (in a way).Beyond this, the show mainly focuses on turning the lovecraftian mythos into a source of humour, which further supports this thesis. However, not much about it stands out as much as the main cast.D) What I think it fails at:Which is a shame, really, since the main cast is terribly developed. Any development they get is limited to Mahiro (perfectly generic harem protagonist) slowly getting more accepting of his relationship with Nyarko.Apart from this, there is no discernible change in the dynamics between the characters, which is a shame, even though the dynamics at hand are quite stable and can be exercised in various ways.Another issue is the lack of motivation for the events at hand - mainly the romantic interest of Nyarko in Mahiro. There are only veeeery slight glimpses as to what she finds attractive about him, if there is anything at all.He gets no proper characterisation, as is standard in harem anime, which makes it very difficult to empathise with Nyarko\'s infatuation with him. Similarly, but in a slightly less problematic manner, his disdain for her is rarely elaborated on.This is, yet again, a staple of many harem shows, but it bears mentioning. There ARE some good reasons as to why the MC does not reciprocate Nyarko\'s feelings - from a meta perspective, the tension would drop immediately if he did, and the show would instantly devolve into hentai.In-story, the MC simply has no interest in her. Even if he had, there would be no way to discern it - his character is so flat that it does not allow for interpretations of his preferences. Some speculation has gone into the idea that the MC is gay - however, there is probably a simpler explanation.His life gets invaded by an obsessive alien that could kill him in an instant if she wanted to, and wants his babies. She never leaves him alone, or any choice, for that matter. Swap the sexes, and you\'d call the police.If you want to, you can think of him as a pendant to Kira from JJBA Pt4 - He just wants a quiet life. If that makes him any more redeemable as a character, my job is done. The anime, however, had to fail before I could fix it.Furthermore, he has no idea why she likes him - he doubts the reality behind her feelings for him, as has been elaborated on in a later episode. Perhaps the MC had been tricked into a fraud relationship before, making him anxious about this whole shebang?...No, of course not. The show doesn\'t even remotely care to give motivation to him and Nyarko, which is a missed opportunity in its own right, if not for the potential character development it could entail.By the end of the season, you do have some small advances in the disposition of the MC towards Nyarko, which is nice. However, the way it was handled overall was suboptimal.Also, it does not present a proper homage to Lovecraft with this. If that\'s what you came here for...I dont know what\'s wrong with you. Good horror? In anime? And then in a show centered around one titular cute girl character? Get out.E) What the show surprised me with: (in a positive or neutral way)The expertise with which it pulls off its wish-fulfillment, dirty jokes, and sets them up so nonchalantly. It is confident in being predictable and cliché. And even though I despise the crude humour it devolves to sometimes, It shifts its focus often enough to make it bearable.There is variety - of the good kind.Overall, it was more than I expected of a show about a...uh...you know the plot what am I talking about.It turned a frighteningly weird premise into an enjoyable, even if dubious, ride. And with the last two episodes, it might actually have gotten to a point in quality that I can safely say was...pretty good?F) What I wish the anime had done, but didn\'t:The plot, oh my goooood. Most of the time, an arc lasts about 2 episodes, maybe 3. During these sections, the show keeps focus, but there could have been done much, MUCH more with the setting of lovecraft\'s creations forming an intergalactic society.They could have traveled to the stars! Traveled in time, not even Yith-style! (props for inserting the Yith,though). However, the show doesn\'t bother. The characters live at the MCs house for the entirety of the plot. Bluh.Can someone please just write fanfic about this? Wait, NO DONT PLEASE-G) Should you watch it? (whom is it for)If you dislike trashy shows, RUN and hope Nyarko-chan doesn\'t find you and steal your virginity. This is as trashy as it gets. We\'re talking a Yuri-BoysLove-Vanilla love pentagram that provides enough fanservice to make me question if Eromanga sensei could be like this. (I did not watch the latter, so these are only suspicions)If you\'re in for something deep and engaging, you will be bored. There\'s no lore or intellect to be found here.BUT, if you\'re in for mindless, intense humour that will rip you out of your chair, paired with some juicy fanservice here and there, in one truly weird setting, then this is the train you should hop onto.Depending on your preferences, this might even be a very good show for you.---------SCORING:1) Proficiency in execution9/10 - You\'d be surprised how much work goes into making a good trash harem.2) Depth of concepts and characterisation3/10 - There\'s some depth if you\'re willing to see it, but I couldn\'t write an essay about it either.3) Entertainment value8/10 - For how ridiculous this show is, and for how little dignity I have left, I had a blast. Almost as much as with Gamers!4) Memorability (decided a month later)-/10 - I predict that in a month, I will only remember the scenes of Nyarko being overly attached girlfriend.

There\'s a SEASON TWO? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE\'S AN OVA?!?!?!?!?![opens emergency Vodka flask]...Some other time. Maybe never.Hopefully.........Okay, so what\'s season 2 about? of this show is so immensely anime that I would show it to anyone who needs a lesson on what this medium can come down to.A) What I expected when going into this show: (backstory, expectations, predisposition)I first stumbled upon this gem of a show when doing my routine stroll through crunchyroll\'s sidebar list of anime to find something extraordinary.Upon first sight, a heartfelt laugh escaped by chest - All my alarm bells for ""Gimmicky show"" were ringing at full volume.An anthropo-comedy show, I was sure of it. But with a lovecraftian god (and Nyarlathotep of all!) as the main chick? I was BEYOND sceptical about the quality of this idea.Apart from that basic info (which made the show seem painfully generic and at the same time highly interesting), I had no ideas as to what i should expect.The pictures on MAL and CR were too incongruous with my idea of a show featuring old-school horror.As an aside, I watched Blend S before this show (I did NOT like it), and had a predisposition to thinking that nothing could possibly have less dignity than that show.If you can\'t tell yet, I\'m not a fan of useless fanservice.B) What the viewing experience is like:It\'s like nothing I\'ve seen so far. There are lots of shows which people recommend you to ""turn your brain off"" to;This notion always struck me as odd, but now I understand it all too well.You cannot watch Nyarko-san without sacrificing some sanity. In that sense, it is quite a subtle application of lovecraftian psychology/horror.Sure, it doesn\'t SCARE you to insanity, but it sure drives up a wall! The show constantly fulfills every cliché expectations you might have, and goes even beyond.It indulges in its craziness, grabs you by the hand and doesn\'t let it go until you have lost either your virginity, your temper or your sanity.The only way you can enjoy the show is to accept it as what it is, and not question the premise, the execution, or...basically anything.How does this craziness manifest itself?Hyperactivity of the plot; Nothing stands still for even a second.References to anime and gaming culture as well as Lovecraft\'s works that bear no impact on the plot 50% of the time and are clearly there to entertain the knowledgeable viewers.Shameless fanservice and harem tropes. Yes. This is a harem.(As if there were a way to avoid this nowadays >.>) I have to admit, this show is as close to an ecchi as you can possibly go without it being categorised as such.Prepare yourself for the most thirsty aliens you have seen in media, as well as a mother that loves her son maybe a bit too much.C) What I think this show excels at:Nyarko-san is a rare case of ""Terrible concept - brilliant execution"". The creators of this show knew that there was nothing serious they could make of this setting,and thus they went for the complete opposite - total, utter absurdity.The pacing of the show leaves no gaps to be bored. Every shot shows something interesting or relevant to the plot, and rarely is there a moment where you are let off the hook.Even though the humour might not be of your taste, its comedic timing is spot on. This is a rare sight nowadays, and really makes this show enjoyable when you find value in its brand of wish-fulfillment, absurd humour.Its references range from everything in between Pokemon and obscure shows you probably haven\'t heard about. (Pop team epic, anyone?)As an interesting aside: The show seems to give off a strong vibe that the video game obsession most of the characters have is reflective of the creators. I think it\'s telling that this show has more actual gamers in it than Gamers!.Another facette of this execution is the way the plot is constructed long-term: There is no real overarching structure to it, but a (very predictable) and elaborate plan to increase the shenanigan density overall.As soon as the dynamics between the current characters could start getting out of hand or stale, the show introduces a twist to make up for it. Be it a new character that breaks the symmetry of the love triangle (rectangle? pentagram?)or just a plain ol\' body swap -  Nyarko-san never fails to deliver the kind of entertainment that keeps you on your toes, whether you like it or not.There is also (for this kind of show seemingly out-of-place) foreshadowing and adherence to Chekov\'s gun. In particular, a certain gimmicky charm comes to mind as being useful again and again in vital moments of the show.On that note, an honourable mention is the *perfection* with which the main chick, Nyarko-san, is executed. She is possibly the most annoying, hyperactive, clingy, perverted love interest that a teenage boy could dream of, and as such fills her role spot on.She reacts to everything, forces the main character into the most embarrassing situations and literally wants his babies more than anything. The show pulls no breaks in characterising her as the most inhumanly obsessive lover you could imagine.Which...sounds annoying and unrealistic at first...until you realise it.This is genius. She\'s a lovecraftian god. OF COURSE she\'s inhuman! Of course she is destroying the sanity of both the main character and the viewer! Of course the stunts of absurd, meta comedy she pulls are seemingly out-of-the-blue.The seemingly pointless idiocy of the characters and plot shit actually serves to provide a lovecraftian horror that is not scary, but endearing (in a way).Beyond this, the show mainly focuses on turning the lovecraftian mythos into a source of humour, which further supports this thesis.

This is the anime that changed that. I'll have to give it credit for that.Here I was, looking for something after finishing Shakugan No Shana II, and I come across this show.

I initially had absolutely no desire to see such a series, but I figured I might as well watch something with as outlandish of a premise as this for one of the entries for my Anime Watching Challenge of 2019. After episode 1, I was intrigued. By episode 12, those moments of intrigue were struck and destroyed. Let me explain by talking about what initially caught my interest... The story.STORY - 6/10The story provided at Episode 1 of Nyaruko was one of the most baffling and convoluted setups I had seen in a long...time, and this just made me want to watch it more. It turns out that the deities written about by H. P. Lovecraft are alive, and not only that, the main girl - Nyarthathotep - is a huge fan of anime and manga. The idea that the series was going to star a girl version of a Lovecraftian deity who loved the media of the planet was ridiculous to me, but in a good way. It almost felt like a serpent eating its own tail; a being that was made from media who saves the world in this media because she likes the world\'s media. It sounded like it could be a setup for something interesting, something that could explore the concepts of humanity\'s obsession with media, with outlandish concepts like Anime Girl Lovecraft, and the like.However, by Episode 12, those hopes that the series could explore something with its tongue-in-cheek tone and meta subtext was thrown out of the window, as it becomes something jarringly generic and basic for a majority of its run time. While we still have moments of outlandish Outword out-of-body experiences, the majority of the series focuses on the same jokes being repeated ad nauseum in a typical high school harem setting. If this were the point - to use this outlandish concept to do something generic - as a form of meta storytelling itself about how these dime-a-dozen stories themselves have practically become indescribable and horrific beasts of the art form could have been funny; but if this is what they were going for then it failed miserably.Nyaruko never changes. It never explores anything it has the potential to. Nyaruko stays as one of the most generic stories I have seen in a long time. Every character has their joke, they are forced to say it once every two minutes or so, ad infinitum. What had potential to explore the ways we have seemingly started grabbing at straws for story concepts, or how media itself is a shapeless beast that seeps its way into our mind like a Lovecraftian beast itself, or even make a tongue-in-cheek homage to the ridiculous anime concepts that come before it, it does the most unfortunate thing and does nothing. The references it makes are incredibly basic - Jojo, Fist of the North Star, Gundam, Dragon Quest. It\'s nothing that would be unique or interesting to it as a series. The only times Nyaruko brings up media isn\'t to explore it, or to gleam any meaning from it or even the show itself, it\'s just to reference it. References make up a large majority of this show\'s humor, and while that makes sense, seeing as how the show itself is almost like one big reference to Lovecraft itself, that does make it a good or enjoyable show.ART - 4/10The art is incredibly generic. There\'s no semblance of a unique art style here or a unique vision from a director. It... Exists. It isn\'t ugly, but it isn\'t interesting. There\'s nothing to say, as it itself says nothing. Asking me to comment on the visuals of Nyaruko would be like telling me to describe the taste of water.SOUND - 5/10While I appreciate the attempts that the musicians take in attempting to make the OP an earworm that goes into your head, almost like the whispers of an Old God itself, besides that there\'s nothing to mention. The ED isn\'t interesting, the OST has nothing going for it, the voices are generic and don\'t come close to resonating with me. It exists and doesn\'t sound terrible, so I can give it that.CHARACTER - 1/10These are not characters. These characters are sheets of paper with a single character trait written on them and nothing else. Nyaruko likes anime and the protagonist. The protagonist doesn\'t like Nyaruko. Kuuko likes Nyaruko. Hasuta likes the protagonist. This is the entirety of the personalities of these characters. It becomes increasingly annoying as you watch the show and continue to see the exact same jokes repeated over and over for 20 minutes at a time for about 12 episodes - I\'ll be generous and say 10 because the first and last episodes may not have had AS MANY of these bog standard jokes.And the characters that we have the pleasure of hearing repeat the same jokes over and over for 20 minutes a pop are some of the most annoying pieces of trash I have ever seen. They are unchanging from their original personality trait, and that personality trait is annoying and boring. Characters have to always be loud and annoying and yelling all the time in an annoying manner. It\'s absolutely some of the worst writing I have seen when it comes to giving characters personalities and unique thoughts and moments. Hasuta, for example, only has the personality trait of wanting to have intercourse with our main character. At least Nyaruko also enjoyed media on top of wanting to lay with our main character, and at least Kuuko liked games as well as liking Nyaruko (though sexualizing Nyaruko is her defining trait and becomes the line she must contractually say every 30 seconds), Hasuta is the worst written of them all as he has no defining traits outside of wanting to ""have babies"" with our protagonist. It\'s just awful. They\'re all awful.ENJOYMENT - 3/10Again, while I enjoyed the concepts the first episode had the potential to bring up, I was enjoying the first episode or two, but the show fell into a trap of annoyance and repetition that caused me to despise watching it as I continued. However, as much as I hate to say it, there was a joke or two I chuckled at later on, mainly because those jokes were escapes from the generic repetitive jokes of the past 4 episodes.OVERALL - 3/10It has a generic look, generic sounds, some of the least developed and most annoying characters I have ever had the displeasure to watch, and has the substance of watching a single episode 12 times in a row rather than watching all 12 unique episodes. It\'s like watching a series comprised of nothing but Endless Eight, except turning up the volume so loud it makes your ears bleed and shoving a bunch of references into it. time, and this just made me want to watch it more.

It becomes increasingly annoying as you watch the show and continue to see the exact same jokes repeated over and over for 20 minutes at a time for about 12 episodes - I\'ll be generous and say 10 because the first and last episodes may not have had AS MANY of these bog standard jokes.And the characters that we have the pleasure of hearing repeat the same jokes over and over for 20 minutes a pop are some of the most annoying pieces of trash I have ever seen. They are unchanging from their original personality trait, and that personality trait is annoying and boring. Characters have to always be loud and annoying and yelling all the time in an annoying manner. It\'s absolutely some of the worst writing I have seen when it comes to giving characters personalities and unique thoughts and moments. Hasuta, for example, only has the personality trait of wanting to have intercourse with our main character. At least Nyaruko also enjoyed media on top of wanting to lay with our main character, and at least Kuuko liked games as well as liking Nyaruko (though sexualizing Nyaruko is her defining trait and becomes the line she must contractually say every 30 seconds), Hasuta is the worst written of them all as he has no defining traits outside of wanting to ""have babies"" with our protagonist. It\'s just awful. They\'re all awful.ENJOYMENT - 3/10Again, while I enjoyed the concepts the first episode had the potential to bring up, I was enjoying the first episode or two, but the show fell into a trap of annoyance and repetition that caused me to despise watching it as I continued. However, as much as I hate to say it, there was a joke or two I chuckled at later on, mainly because those jokes were escapes from the generic repetitive jokes of the past 4 episodes.OVERALL - 3/10It has a generic look, generic sounds, some of the least developed and most annoying characters I have ever had the displeasure to watch, and has the substance of watching a single episode 12 times in a row rather than watching all 12 unique episodes. It\'s like watching a series comprised of nothing but Endless Eight, except turning up the volume so loud it makes your ears bleed and shoving a bunch of references into it.', '(A very long time ago; things used to be different.

This may be updated in the future, but for the most part many of my opinions of the show are unlikely to change.Stating Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, I had fun with the non-serious tone of the show and much of that has held throughout thus far. However the show has a few glaring problems that even casual watchers will have a tough time avoiding. For starters the protagonist, Mahiro Yasaka, is the most unlikable main character out of any anime I have ever watched. He...makes generic ecchi protagonists look like Romeo and Einstein rolled into one. Not only is Mahiro stupid in every manner possible, he's also an ungrateful cretin who constantly complains about his life, he pushes his problems onto other people, can't solve any simple social situation himself unless it involves beating on a girl. Not to mention he has the shortest memory imaginable as he seems clueless to the intent of other characters which have been stated by said characters no less than 1 minute ago in the episode IN FRONT OF HIM. Throughout 8 episodes he has had no character development, however let's try to focus on the rest of the cast. Don't expect anything, just your typical bunch of archetypes, in comparison I like the rest of the them a lot more than the protagonist no matter the flaws they seem to have. For the most part I like Nyaruko, however her blind affection toward Mahiro start to wear thin after a few episodes. Also I'm not lying about Mahiro, at one point  he's threatened that he will become a gay sex slave and at this point I was cheering for it to happen, unfortunately for the show and its characters that plan didn't fall through.Moving onto the story... I don't review very often and even I can predict the majority of the plot twists and who's going to be involved in the development. Honestly this isn't a show you watch for the story, but even then the writing is absolutely attrocious. The sound and art are average with no glaring issues.If you decide to watch this show, turn your brain off, expect the obvious and just try to enjoy the show for what it is.

It’s got a comedy-harem set up, the girls are all human manifestations of lovecraftian horror monsters, but some girls have the hots more for each other than out lead guy, which is a plus (hey, I’m a simple guy, girl-love is always going to score a few extra points with me). This show should have been a cash cow like Monster Musume before that was even...a thing. But this show comes up short on its payload at nearly every turn .So, where (and why) did this show miss the mark?First off, a bit of history. While the true-blue anime series didn’t see the light of day until 2012, this IP began as a light novel series entitled “Haiyore! Nyaruko-san” in October of 2009 and got its “anime” debut as a series of five to ten minute flash shorts from 2010 to 2011, and these shorts are admittedly pretty damn hilarious; I highly recommend you check them out. But what about the main course? Ehh. . . .The show kicks off with our eponymous silver-haired heroine being introduced by saving the main guy, Mahiro, from some demonic entity and we just kind of go from there with no real explanation of what where when or why; it’s just all there for the sake of being there because, well, we’re marketing this as a character driven show to sell a shit-ton of figurines and other merch for the otakus so who cares about idle details like compelling narrative, or any narrative for that matter.And that is your first insight into how this anime will go on to conduct itself: just doing so for the sake of doing so. “Forced” does not even begin to describe this show or its humor. So many of the jokes center around just random stuff: like the shoehorned super mega video game console that has too many features and fails or the fact that Mahiro’s main weapons are forks for no discernible reason.As for the plot, there isn’t one, this show is almost completely an episodic affair. “Oh that’s fine, it worked for Space Dandy, right?” you might say. Well, Space Dandy had some great episodes, some good episodes, some mediocre ones, and a few outright stinkers. It basically just pinballed all over the place. Nyaruko-san? Well, it just flatlines it all the way through. At no point does this show ever get any more interesting or funnier than in its first five minutes. Not only that, but they use up all their jokes in the first half of the first season! We’re six episodes deep into a twenty-four episode run, people, and we just blew our load in the first quarter!?The jokes are just too fast and too out of left field to work for twenty plus minutes, and then it hit me: Nyaruko-san wasn’t bad in spite of its run time, it was bad because of it. With the five minute long episodes, the showrunners would craft a single joke around an entire episode and it wouldn’t feel forced or too drawn out because it would just hit and roll off so well. Set-up, build up, punchline, laugh, credits roll, watch the next one. It’s a formula that works well for online shorts but falls flat on its face when drug out for nearly half an hour.The OP and ED are both above average to good for both seasons, but the show really shines in art style and character design. The show is definitely distinctive; you’re not going to mistake it for anything else coming down the pipe during the same time period, but all of this isn’t enough to save the show as a whole.And don’t get me wrong, there’s potential here, I see it; Fuck yeah, I see it, but it is just poorly executed.

I'm a huge fan of H.P.

On the other, I can't help but be sincerely confused as to why.Even though I enjoyed this show, I feel...like I don't want people to know that I enjoyed it. I'm not into rom-com animes, and there is 0 chance I would have watched this if it wasn't just for the absurdity of an anime where Nyarlathotep, the crawling chaos, is a small anime girl.

I'm not into rom-com animes, and there is 0 chance I would have watched this if it wasn't just for the absurdity of an anime where Nyarlathotep, the crawling chaos, is a small anime girl. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it. It's alright, I enjoyed it (even if it wasn't good per se), and I guess that's enough."", 'Spiritually, Lovecraftian horror and cute girls anime are perfect opposites; on the spectrum of things that exist, no matter what criteria you use to judge, these two things will be at loggerheads.  But, of course, anime is the eternal struggle to reimagine every personality, object, and abstract concept into a cute girl, and starting with diametric opposition is either the obvious move or so decadently stupid that anyone still conscious enough to react probably couldn’t form a coherent argument against it.Did it work, though?  Haiyore! Nyaruko-san was cute for the first episode or two, when Nyaruko was a ball of energy driven by...pure novelty and some adorable randomly interspersed English.  The OP is endearing and I’m a big fan of the ED.  Otherwise, a lot of this show is kind of a slog.  Most of the jokes revolve around how much every character is in love with every other character (except for Mahiro, that featureless trash).  The rest are merely references to better shows (and the occasional worse show).  All the humor has the same setup, and often the same fork-related punchline; that stops being charming quite rapidly.  Before long, I realized that the only reason I was still watching was for Nyaruko, and then mostly because I enjoyed Kana Asumi’s voice work so much.The first episode or two made it seem like there would be a consistent running narrative throughout the show, but that quickly dies down once Nyaruko, Kuuko, and eventually Hastur gather up their convenient excuses for living under the same roof and continuing to be relevant to the show.  From there, the show devolves into a handful of episodic arcs that only serve as excuses for more lazy jokes and don’t build off each other.  The larger universe occasionally toured or mentioned isn’t all that interesting or fleshed-out, and aims more for momentary convenience than cohesion.  Stuff springs into existence when it’s necessary and vanishes when the joke has passed.  There’s not much reason to expect anything more from a middle-of-the-road rom com, except, perhaps, if that rom com were based on one of the most iconic and expansive mythoi in the modern world and had a lot of opportunities to be better than a totally mediocre weekly wacky waifu roundup.  This didn’t have to be brilliant, but it could have been less of a horrid bore.Talk about an unlikable protagonist.  Mahiro expresses no reciprocation of Nyaruko’s feelings and yet we’re meant to believe that there will eventually be some manner of fulfillment.  His response to Nyaruko’s advances is never the perfectly reasonable, “Why would I want to be in a relationship with the God of a Thousand Forms?  Won’t my soul get warped beyond conceivable reality?”  Instead, it’s just, “Ew, girls.  I’m 15 and unrelatable.”  He’s always indignant and testy, as if it’s somehow a great tragedy and a major inconvenience that there’s a cute girl who lives with him, watches anime with him, and loves him unconditionally.  Mahiro is an obnoxious brat and there is no evident reason at all why Nyaruko should be so head-over-heels in love with him.  This kid is every terrible, bland, pasty, infuriating romantic comedy anime protagonist.  Yet this is also unlike so many other shows that string the audience along through the characters’ indecisiveness; Mahiro has made his decision quite firmly, but we’re expected to blatantly disregard it.  You, I, Nyaruko, the real Nyarlathotep, H.P. Lovecraft, and the whole world deserve better.I suppose I allowed myself to be convinced briefly that this show would be different, but don’t be fooled by the fact that the girl on the cover is apparently one of Nyarlathotep’s many incarnations.

Some people may say that this series is somewhat ""milking"" the consumers but in all honesty to me its just people looking at things from a narrow perspective if that is all one has to say.The anime does not do sins on shoving up fanservice to make big bucks but instead parodies it, if you actually know how to critique anime then you\'d realize that fanservice...usually is given in a seriously comedic tone. Instead of small accident types or inserts here and there, fanservice was placed in times where it could be made of and the fact that it should not have happened or other times forced is emphasized for comedic effect.Another sin that this anime does not do is to make it generic, instead you find a lot of scenes where the characters literally parody famous scenes or lines from more famous anime. Moreover generic plotlines are made fun of, the characters act in a comedic way, battles for example are prolonged or forced to go through stupid long sequences for the characters to make it shounen. But this was deliberate by the characters because of their desire to make it that way, of course we have a straight man (the MC) who calls them out in a boke manner for comedic effect.If you haven\'t caught on this is a boke themed comedy, making it all serious is basically just showing how narrow your thinking on media is. To be fair I get it that your taste may not match with this anime but at least know what your getting into before watching it and criticizing the series. The series didn\'t market itself as some top grade, serious shounen with tear jerking romance and drama between an human and alien. It literally markets itself as a comedic show about how a human is shoved into a crazy life surrounded by aliens, moreover the fanservice is not even on the level of To Love Ru where nudity occurs ever scene for comedy, the fanservice scenes in this anime is timed and well executed and not done by pure lucky pervert.Now onto the sins of the story which are mainly - forced character development and plot.So okay, as great as the series is, I haven\'t read the LN and only watched and reawatched the anime tons of times but I quite frankly dislike the overarching plot of making the MC accept FL.This may become less objective at this point but I\'ll try my best, so for the character development, most series that did this kind of story great would make the main theme be the comedy. This series did that but kind of overdid things when they headed for the slow development of feelings. The problem was not the goal but the method, here the problem lies in the MC. His base character was great but then in many parts of the story he failed in making great comedic lines because drama or relationship developments had to be made.This happens for most of the latter half of the anime, comedic plot lines are lost because of forced drama which were not properly timed thus the intended drama looked cringe at best crappy at worst. The atmosphere- basically the whole scene was just turned from a comedy fest to this weird minute of serious drama which at times is nicely wrapped up by a final meme comedic twist which worked out 70% of the time but in some it just didn\'t work out.It may be hard to understand but you\'ll feel it when you get to the latter half of the anime.The other sin of character development was kinda tackled already but to simplify it the main issue is basically the MC. His whole character is messy to say the least. All other characters had a great foundation and since this is a boke-comedy themed anime slow or almost zero character development is expected.But the MC is weak point in this as nothing would want you to continue watching with an MC who\'s just the straight man of the group which is bad because most of the time straight men are- well- side characters.The character development of the MC is a great way to keep people watching but the drama based development was just- well BAD. ESPECIALLY THE LAST TWO EPISODES - that should still be good.Anyway, the series is great overall, which is telling because some series would become dumpster fire with an MC like this series has but the comedy the other characters bring with just makes the series enjoyable save for small bits where the MC is the focus. usually is given in a seriously comedic tone.

Nyaruko-san. I haven\'t seen the OVAs or the other season. Yet.Haiyore! Nyaruko-san isn\'t an easy show to review for me, because it\'s almost like two shows in one. Not that the characters change or the basic premise changes or anything, but the quality is not consistent throughout the season.I actually dropped the show after watching episode 1, because I didn\'t find the humor particularly funny and it felt like it was all over the place, mood wise.Then one day I came across it again and decided to try for episode 2 and ended...up binging the rest of the show in one sitting.From episode 2-7 Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is actually pretty hilarious. The main character, Mahiro Yasaka, is your standard boring ass normie high school boy with zero personality who, for reasons unknown, is the love interest of a crazy Lovecraftian deity out of the Cthulhu mythos (Nyaruko, for whom the show is named), personified as a cute anime girl. Her love for Mahiro is obsessive and borderline obnoxious, but in the above mentioned episodes (2-7) the show manages to maintain a fine line where it stays funny. Other than Nyaruko there\'s a bunch of wacky side characters who contribute to the entourage/harem around Mahiro.I thoroughly enjoyed these episodes. The jokes make fun of standard anime tropes and various tropes from the world of dating games and manga, and if you\'re familiar with the clichés, you\'ll laugh at the way they are treated here.There\'s not a huge amount of story and the world is never explained in detail. It\'s a character-driven gag show and relies on jokes based on the individual quirks of the characters more than out right slap stick, though there\'s some of that as well.Sadly something weird happens around episode 8. The pace of the show changes. New characters are introduced and the humor changes. This is most extreme for Nyaruko, who was borderline obnoxious but now becomes over the top obnoxious to the point where she\'s straight up annoying. I don\'t know if they ran out of ideas or what, but she stops being funny around episode 8. She seems to lose quite a lot of her intelligence as well. Instead of being a ""malign deity"" who uses her devilish wiles to (unsuccessfully) chase the affections of the main character, she ends up a braindead lovesick fool in the last 4 episodes. The other characters who played a more prominent role in the first 7-8 episodes are relegated to the background and the show begins to focus more on Mahiro.This is a mistake, because Mahiro is hands down the most boring character in the show. He\'s the straight guy to the craziness of the rest of the character gallery. He thinks boring thoughts and says boring things. We don\'t care about him because he is not funny and this is a comedy show. So why the developers thought we needed more of Mahiro and less of the rest of the characters, is a mystery. But it almost feels like episodes 1-7 were made by a different team of writers and directors than episodes 8-12. Those last 4 episodes are hard to watch. It\'s a very significant and noticeable difference. Like they just ran out of steam and forgot what made it fun.So I\'ll give it 6/10. Episodes 2-7 are easily an 8/10, but the first episode and last 4 episodes drag it down to a 6 for me.The opening song is great though! up binging the rest of the show in one sitting.From episode 2-7 Haiyore!

Gantz,https://myanimelist.net/anime/384/Gantz,"['Gantz is gritty. Gantz is gruesome. Gantz is a show where a bunch of people who have died essentially become the Japanese MIB, only with a Battle Royale twist.Now that may sound like an intriguing premise, but let me continue. I\'m a pretty easy going guy and I can tolerate more nonsense than most people. For instance, I\'ve actually watched (and in some cases enjoyed) Ikkitousen, Elfen Lied, Mezzo Forte and even some hentai, so I know tasteless when I see it. Gantz is many things, but someone would have a hard time trying to defend it as tasteful. Everyone, including old folks, kids,...and women, get treated like utter crap. They are either getting humiliated and/or abused (physically or sexually). What I\'m trying to say is: Gantz is pretty F\'d up.The funny thing is I don\'t even really dislike Gantz, but I\'d be lying if I said Gantz had any kind of depth. They do a lot of talking, but they don\'t really ever say much. The plot could be described in a paragraph but is stretched out over 13 episodes where you only get two encounters with Gantz/aliens and lots of discussions about whether to shoot or not.Let\'s start with the easy part, the pros:1) So where does Gantz go right?Well... I suppose the idea behind the show is interesting? Guys with special suits and secret missions caught up in some bizarre intergalactic excursion. The opening theme isn\'t bad, at least at first, it starts to get old pretty fast though. The sectioned layer teleportation was kind of cool. There\'s quite a bit of funny ""engrish"" like ""You can be RIDER powful"" and ""hear are your skores"" that amused me. I also enjoyed the Dragonball Z, Fist of the Northstar and possibly Akira references. If you like violence with a lot of nudity mixed in, Gantz has you covered. I guess there is a certain level of... honesty(?) in Gantz\'s sadistic depiction of humanity. Kato is the only real trace of decency and dignity in the whole show. Gantz is probably the funniest/best part of the show, you bastards.At best Gantz is a cutting criticism of the dark side of human beings and a hard look at the many flaws that can make people detestable. As such, people are mostly portrayed as weak, cruel, manipulative, inconsiderate and degenerate. Now to some extent I suppose one could consider this seemingly realistic, but more likely, Gantz is the cynical machinations of a misanthrope with deep seated resentment towards the world and some deviant wish fulfillment. Now I\'m not passing judgement here, if that\'s what you are into, then... ok... but let\'s call it what it is.2) So what does Gantz do wrong?First, the main character (Kei) is, to be blunt, an insufferable, lecherous prick who doesn\'t know that he\'s an unlikeable, pathetic prick. Almost every other character is as well, or they are gullible and naive. As if that\'s not bad enough, the show seems to actually attempt to glorify or sympathize with Kei\'s adventures in douchebaggery. Now, I\'m not allergic to douchey characters, I\'ve liked both Light from Death Note and Lelouche from Code Geass. I liked Light\'s perseverance and determination, and Lelouche\'s cunning and bravado, but Kei... he\'s cowardly, perpetually perverted, selfish, and kind of stupid. I\'m not just ""hating"" or saying this out of some kind of predetermined bias, in all honesty, he really just doesn\'t have a single redeeming quality to speak of. I didn\'t think this character could get any worse, but, the dub somehow manages to make him sound like even more of a shameless creep.Then there\'s the animation. I\'m not like some people who gripe and complain about the use of CGI in anime, and I don\'t even mind it here either, but some of the actual animation is so lazy and terrible...There are scenes with random pixelation and (intentional?) ghosting and plenty of still/pan scenes where it looks like they were cutting corners in order to afford preserving the CGI to animation ratio that makes up half the show.Lastly there\'s the female main character. Her method of death was apparently suicide (bathtub cutting). So we are introduced to one of Gantz dubious and faulty premises. Let\'s be serious for a second. Does this girl even seem like the suicide type? The reasons they give for her ""motive"" aren\'t very convincing. She\'s not ugly, she\'s well endowed (i.e. HUGE breasts) and she shows none of the trademark signs of mental scarring. It\'s not like she would have trouble finding someone willing to employ her or a boyfriend. I think we can all admit someone like that is not in living hell just because of some bad grades. So we are forced to conclude that the whole bathtub scenario is merely a contrived device just to have an excuse to throw in a big boobed girl completely naked.Here is where Gantz shows its true colors. As if it\'s not bad enough that 99% of the show seems to be populated by complete jackasses, within seconds of Kishimoto\'s introduction we are treated to a scene where the girl is very nearly raped, by MULTIPLE people AND a dog. The rest of the show either flashbacks to this or comes up with new ways to have her naked and/or molested.Classy, and this is just season one. This is pretty much all you need to know to make a decision on if Gantz is the kind of show you\'d be interested in watching. Did I mention this show is also kind of gay? Like, literally.All that aside, the character motivations and plot development are erratic. Characters ask stupid questions and have to repeat the same answers continuously over multiple episodes. They also do very stupid things. Such as, doing nothing and just gawking like dumbfounded idiots. The best was the genius plan of inviting yourself into someone\'s home, offering yourself as a pet, getting in their bed, and then expecting it to NOT lead to sex... yeah, that makes a lot of sense... wait, no, IT DOESN\'T.It\'s kind of hard to like Gantz because it\'s a very dark and absurd show. There really aren\'t any likable characters other than Kato and maybe Kishimoto. The worst is how deliberate everything is. Characters take FOREVER to make a decision about ANYTHING. It\'s really kind of deceptive that way. They look like a bad-ass action squad, but in actuality they\'re a way-too-chatty and indecisive INACTION squad. For example, in this one episode they spend the whole time arguing over whether or not to put on their super powered suits. Sheesh. The only things one can really take away from watching Gantz is maybe appreciating it for its harsh depictions of reality or basking in its scattered brutality and rampant depravity. and women, get treated like utter crap. They are either getting humiliated and/or abused (physically or sexually). What I\'m trying to say is: Gantz is pretty F\'d up.The funny thing is I don\'t even really dislike Gantz, but I\'d be lying if I said Gantz had any kind of depth.

I didn\'t think this character could get any worse, but, the dub somehow manages to make him sound like even more of a shameless creep.Then there\'s the animation. I\'m not like some people who gripe and complain about the use of CGI in anime, and I don\'t even mind it here either, but some of the actual animation is so lazy and terrible...There are scenes with random pixelation and (intentional?) ghosting and plenty of still/pan scenes where it looks like they were cutting corners in order to afford preserving the CGI to animation ratio that makes up half the show.Lastly there\'s the female main character. Her method of death was apparently suicide (bathtub cutting). So we are introduced to one of Gantz dubious and faulty premises. Let\'s be serious for a second. Does this girl even seem like the suicide type? The reasons they give for her ""motive"" aren\'t very convincing. She\'s not ugly, she\'s well endowed (i.e. HUGE breasts) and she shows none of the trademark signs of mental scarring. It\'s not like she would have trouble finding someone willing to employ her or a boyfriend. I think we can all admit someone like that is not in living hell just because of some bad grades. So we are forced to conclude that the whole bathtub scenario is merely a contrived device just to have an excuse to throw in a big boobed girl completely naked.Here is where Gantz shows its true colors. As if it\'s not bad enough that 99% of the show seems to be populated by complete jackasses, within seconds of Kishimoto\'s introduction we are treated to a scene where the girl is very nearly raped, by MULTIPLE people AND a dog. The rest of the show either flashbacks to this or comes up with new ways to have her naked and/or molested.Classy, and this is just season one. This is pretty much all you need to know to make a decision on if Gantz is the kind of show you\'d be interested in watching. Did I mention this show is also kind of gay? Like, literally.All that aside, the character motivations and plot development are erratic. Characters ask stupid questions and have to repeat the same answers continuously over multiple episodes. They also do very stupid things. Such as, doing nothing and just gawking like dumbfounded idiots. The best was the genius plan of inviting yourself into someone\'s home, offering yourself as a pet, getting in their bed, and then expecting it to NOT lead to sex... yeah, that makes a lot of sense... wait, no, IT DOESN\'T.It\'s kind of hard to like Gantz because it\'s a very dark and absurd show. There really aren\'t any likable characters other than Kato and maybe Kishimoto. The worst is how deliberate everything is. Characters take FOREVER to make a decision about ANYTHING. It\'s really kind of deceptive that way. They look like a bad-ass action squad, but in actuality they\'re a way-too-chatty and indecisive INACTION squad. For example, in this one episode they spend the whole time arguing over whether or not to put on their super powered suits. Sheesh. The only things one can really take away from watching Gantz is maybe appreciating it for its harsh depictions of reality or basking in its scattered brutality and rampant depravity.', 'Good guy A: I\'m gonna shoot it!Good guy B: Shoot it now!Alien: *kills random guy*Good guy B: Shoot it already!Good guy A: I will for sure!Alien: *kills another guy*Good guy A: Okay, I\'m serious, I think I should shoot it right now...Good guy B: Yeah, sounds like a good idea...Alien: *kills nearly everyone but good guy A and B*Good guy A: *finally shoots the alien*...-mission cleared-==========================================Fun aside, but this is mostly what this anime felt like. It\'s not that it\'s bad at all (the story is quite interesting and offers great potential to make this show an awesome anime), but there\'s still so much that made me feel uncomfortable watching this show. But let\'s start with the good thing:Story:The main characters die in the very beginning and get kinda reborn in an appartment in Tokyo. They receive some super cool weapons and a suit, that offers superhuman strength, as well as the mission to use this equipment to kill some aliens, that are hiding in town,  within 60 minutes. Why they got to do that remains unexplained, but I didn\'t mind that.That actually seemed to be a pretty cool concept to me, and I did enjoy the first episodes.Characters:The characters are cheap... like... really cheap. We got the generic loser, that fell for a beautiful girl, we got the generic beautiful girl, that fell for a tall, muscular guy, and we got the generic muscular guy, that\'s not interested in the girl at all. Besides that we have a lot of annoying side characters, that are mainly used to be crushed by some aliens. Also there\'s no bit of character development in the course of the anime, which would be necessary to make the characters even a little more interesting. So long story short: The characters aren\'t really bad, but they\'re also far from being special or at least interesting.Animation/Artstyle/etc:The anime looks alright, no more, no less, a 5 out of 10, the least you could expect but nothing better. I\'m really struggling how to describe what the show looks like, but I think ""alright"" just describes it perfectly well. There\'s a lot of splatter and a lot of nudity; fans will like it, others won\'t. The design of the aliens is alright aswell (an onion-frakenstein\'s monster-hybrid and birds without wings). Nothing to get excited about, but they\'re okay.Sound:The soundtrack is actually pretty good. It fits the whole scenario and accompanies the action scenes as well as the not-so-action-scenes. The opening\'s still stuck in my head right now by the way.Enjoyment:First of all I did enjoy most parts of the show, because I like the idea and the way the story is told. BUT! Now we get to the big minus, that made some of the episodes a pain in the ass: The fighting scenes are sooo drawn out. I heard a few people comparing it to Dragonball Z, but Gantz is completely different (in a bad way). In DBZ both the hero and the villain stop fighting for hours just to talk about how much they hate each other, but at least they\'re as fair not to attack their enemy while he\'s still talking. In Gantz the ""heroes"" stop fighting to do nothing, while the aliens keep crushing them. It sometimes felt like they didn\'t even want to kill these monsters, and I personally really do hate that. It even made me fast forward some scenes because I just couldn\'t handle it, and eventually it\'s the reason I rate this anime not as good as I\'d actually like to.Recommandation:Don\'t watch it if you can\'t see blood. Don\'t watch it if you don\'t like sex scenes. Don\'t watch it if you get worked up over characters standing on the sidelines. Watch it if you\'re into sci-fi/aliens/mystery/superpowers/whatsoever, and you\'ll be having a good time. -mission cleared-==========================================Fun aside, but this is mostly what this anime felt like.

The pacing is awkward and the artwork pales in comparison to that in the manga.  The artwork of the manga is drawn over 3d models whereas the animation is completely flat.  Also the exquisitely drawn blood and gore of the manga is translated into a few seconds of short unskillfully animated blood squirting.  I suppose they could not invest any money into animating most of it since they knew it would be edited out for several releases. ', 'NOTE: This review is intended to cover Gantz in its entirety.Gantz is about as close as you�ll ever get to a love it or hate it anime. It�s littered with so much gore, profanity, nudity, and sex that it�ll either immediately turn you off or immediately glue your eyes to the screen. Being a person from the latter group I have to say I absolutely loved Gantz right from the start. Well, okay, not exactly right from the start. Gantz starts out in the life of Kei Kurono, an angst ridden teenager who has nothing better to do but think negatively to himself and get...boners in class. He�s always worrying about something, and doesn�t care about anyone else except for himself. To put it simply, he�s like an emo kid on acid. He complains about everything, but mostly dwells on the fact that he�s never gotten laid. Hmm�wonder why. Ten minutes of listening to this punk whine and cry while so eloquently squeezing in the occasional F-word and I dare anyone to not want to turn this anime off and forget all about it. Thankfully things pick up from there, albeit with all the whining and crying still intact.After we get acquainted with our main protagonist we get to meet Katou. Katou is an old time friend of Kei�s who used to look up to him. You see, before Kei was a whinny little punk he was actually a really cool and adventurous kid. Lack of character development doesn�t exactly show why Kei went from hero to zero, but Katou tries to emulate the Kei he once knew throughout the series, starting with attempting to save a homeless guy who fell on the subway tracks, with the help of Kei of course. Here is where the feces (and blood, guts, and various other nasty things) really hits the fan. Kei and Katou successfully aid the drunk homeless guy to safety, but soon realize that a subway is coming their way. Their plan of avoiding it? Run up the tracks passed where the subway should stop. Bad plan? You bet. I don�t know about you, but I�d much rather try my luck at climbing back onto the platform rather than outrunning a damn subway train. But that�s just me. It turns out that Subway isn�t going to stop at the station after all, and both Kei and Katou are royally screwed. They get hit, and heads go flying.Welcome to the true start of Gantz. Here is where things go beyond the boundaries of typical anime. Here is where things get fun. Kei and Katou wake up in this room with a number of random people who all seem to have died. They can�t leave the room, and trying to make sense out of it all is only a waste of time. Introduced into the story next is who I like to call the third wheel. Her name is also Kei, but like everyone else in the series I�ll just call her Kishimoto. Kishimoto serves little to no purpose other than for Kei to obsess and angst over, and as fan service, but with her flakey and often times clueless personality I don�t think she�s doing anyone a service. Luckily Gantz isn�t about character depth; it�s all about violence, nudity, and all that juicy stuff. That�s where the true main character of the anime comes in: Gantz. Gantz is probably one of the coolest anime characters to come around in years, and he doesn�t even have to say a word. He�s psychotic, yet fully in control. He�s evil, yet lovable. He�s the gears in the machine.Gantz is a game of survival that you can�t help but love. Everyone in the room is soon transported to an area of town and can�t leave until they have eliminated the targets selected by Gantz. These targets are as wacky as they are terrifying, and while many of them look harmless or relatively easy to dispatch of that is rarely the case. Part of the excitement of watching Gantz comes from not knowing what everyone will have to go up against next. It�s also worth mentioning that this isn�t your typical �bad guy of the week� series. Each time our reluctant cast is forced into battle it usually lasts for a lot more than just a single episode. This is good, because Gantz is one anime that will probably have you thinking �So many characters, so little time to kill them all.� Gantz sets its characters up like dominos. Very few of them are ever developed, and very few survive long enough to see the last episode. There is a lot of death in Gantz and plenty of gory scenes to cringe at and watch over and over again, trust me.Gantz does suffer from one major flaw, or at least I thought it was major: the ending. For an anime that is so straight forward and brutal right from the start it sure did have a weak and vague ending. Maybe the writers just didn�t know of a good way to end it. The movie The Cube had a very similar ending and plot, so I must wonder if that is what inspired Gantz in the first place. I would have liked to get a little background info on Gantz before it ended. Like where did he come from, and what was the purpose of these �games�.  Either way, there is a lot to love (and hate) in Gantz. It�s lack of character development, almost completely unlikable protagonist, and strict R rating is sure to turn many viewers off, but if you�re a fan of the brutal and nasty stuff I see no reason why you won�t like the fun little rollercoaster that is Gantz.My Score: 9.0Version Watched: English Dub boners in class.

Why are the two seasons even split up in the first place? The first season very clearly does not end the show and the second season picks up right where the first leaves off, so what\'s the point of even writing two reviews? If you have fundamental problems with this decision, blow me. Moving on.Gantz is a show that a lot of people don\'t get. This surprises me because, in the grand scheme of things, Gantz is amazingly simple and straightforward. It\'s brutal in a different way than anime fans are used to because...it pulls absolutely no punches in its delivery. This is an anime that isn\'t really suited for today\'s anime climate, where shit that uses gore for filler gets passed off as ""tough to watch"" (Elfen Lied), and Epic Movie style reference jokes get passed off as funny because moe girls are the ones telling them (Lucky Star). Its supernatural plot sets people up for something that ends up being the polar opposite of what they\'re given. At its core, Gantz is all about keeping it real, and that attitude is what fucks up a lot of the people that try to watch it. Really, it\'s the very definition of a love-it-or-hate-it anime.Essentially, what Gantz does is take familiar stereotypes (the teenager, the helpless titty girl, the self righteous big dude, the serial killers, the gangsters, the bikers, grandma and her spoiled grandson, etc.) and shows you how they would react in a life or death, kill or be killed situation. It\'s a textbook deconstruction that takes character types out of their usual element and throws them dick first into all sorts of trials and tribulations that they aren\'t usually written into. It\'s an anime that makes no judgements on others\' character; ""morally pure"" losers will at times act like fucking psychos, and complete assholes will touch your heart, or at least make you laugh. It\'s an anime that serves as both an indictment and an exoneration of humanity; it will con you into rooting for kill-first-ask-questions-later types over those genuinely concerned about their fellow player, but in the same way it\'ll coax you into rooting against the kill-because-I-like-it types who knowingly and purposefully fuck over everyone else for their own selfish reasons. It\'s an anime that preaches balance as the solution and then kills the balanced ones anyway. It\'s paradoxical, contradictory, cold, and eccentric, because that\'s the way a fantasy-land situation like this would be in the real world.Even though I basically just gave Itchiro Itano a textual handjob up there, Gantz is certainly not without its flaws. If you are not emotionally invested, or at least interested, in the fates of any of the characters (the majority of which are horrible douches), this anime will rape you with how slow its pace is. Battles have a tendency to run for 3 or more episodes and they can be the most frustrating things to have to sit through for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it feels like writers don\'t know how to end a battle so they just keep throwing more shit at us (the 3rd fight ends with Katou fighting a giant green turd because they literally ran out of ideas), some battles are plagued by having a cast of pussies who ruin perfectly good opportunities because none of them will act first, sometimes the characters launch into the Communist Manifesto during the middle of a fight scene, etc. There\'s much more dialogue than action, so if you\'re just watching this to see dead guys cash checks and break necks, then I\'m sorry but you\'re going to be disappointed. The writers have a tendency to let the plot dictate the character\'s actions, even if it means making otherwise logical characters act dumb as hell, just to further the show along. Above all that though, Gantz\'s most pervasive flaw is that the cynicism is often left unchecked. Half the shit in this show could be something out of Youngblood or Bloodpain or Assblood or any other generic, ""dark"" 90s comic book. Every child is beaten, every woman is nearly raped, the one black guy is a gay thug, the bully rips the Karate instructor\'s teeth out of his gums, the guy who loves guns also loves torturing things, the goody-two-shoes old man tries to ""save"" a kid serial killer by talking sternly to him, that same serial killer tries to validate killing and raping homeless people (!!!) with a long-winded speech about war, and so on and so forth. It just gets really really over the top at times and, I mean, I don\'t have a problem with that (I loved Death Note and its intense notebook writing action), but it shits all over the ""realistic and gritty"" atmosphere the anime tries to present.The art? Um, it\'s ok. That\'s about the best I can say. It incorporates some CGI, and it runs the gauntlet from good to ""what the fuck is that?"" The monster designs are pretty creative and they make up for how generic the character designs are. The backgrounds are nicely done as well, so no complaints there. Animation wise, the show is plagued by stiff computer animation and an assortment of cheap tricks that actually made me do a few double takes while I was watching. Nothing to write home about.Sound in-show is barely even noticeable. The OP is pretty cool but I skipped it a lot. I imagine it would\'ve gotten pretty fucking annoying quick if I had to hear it on a regular basis. The ED? Uhhhhh yea its ok. Generic, relaxing, melancholy Jpop. I expected much more in both of these departments from GONZO than what we were given---oh wait, no I didn\'t. The English dub was middle of the road as well, not shit-tier but not god-tier either. Some of the voice actors were better than others but for the most part my only complaints are subjective, so we\'ll move on.Out of everything it seems the characters are what piss most people off about this show. For starters, there\'s a rotating assortment of cast members because they\'re constantly killed off. Because of the wide array of assholes that regularly appear on this fine cartoon, the very few people you can sympathize with (aside from Katou) are minor roles, which sucks because again, in this show being a member of the supporting cast is an instant death sentence. There\'s a lot of varying personalities, some you\'ll like, some you\'ll hate; I think this is probably one of Gantz\'s strongest points because it allows the show to stay fresh, even if it is at the expense of a lot of character development. The 3 people of biggest importance to the plot are:Kurono, the whiny, horny, selfish, impressionable teenager. Probably one of the least likable characters on the show. His development is really haphazard because the second he starts to change in a certain direction, the show waves its floppy dick and fucks the whole playing field up. On the spectrum, he\'s more or less centered between I\'m-a-fucking-psychopath and I-fucking-care-about-everyone, and as such, he can be cool one moment and then act like a flailing dumbshit the next. Really, he\'s whatever the writers need him to be for that specific episode. Personality wise, the most flexible member of the cast.Katou, the big dude with everyone\'s best interests at heart. One of the only glimpses of genuine goodness on the show. Can get really, really fucking annoying when he hinders the progress of the group with his nobility, but at other times he\'s a welcome break from the sea of dickheads this show throws at us. Sometimes loses control and legitimately hurts people (physically). His only reason to really continue on living is to raise his little brother.Kishimoto, ahhh fuck this bitch. IMO the least likable member of the cast, even worse than that fucking serial killer kid or that whiny businessman. This bitch is the worst. Killed herself because her bad grades lead to a strained relationship with her mother or something like that. I don\'t know, it was basically just an excuse for us to see her naked (which is stupid because we saw her naked like 30 other times afterwards). Depends on others for 98% of the show and is always yelling at other people for not doing anything when she herself does the equivalent of masturbating during a house fire. Kept around primarily for fanservice and to create sexual tension. Not exactly emotionally stable but that\'s to be expected considering the circumstances of her death.Did I enjoy this anime? It depends on what you mean by enjoy. Its hard to ""enjoy"" an anime like Gantz in the typical sense, but it was well executed and at times pretty fun to watch, so I\'ll say yeah. Plus it made me laugh multiple times (both intentionally and unintentionally), and in an anime this bleak, I think that counts for something.Overall I give it a 7. Watch it for the black guy, he\'s hilarious. it pulls absolutely no punches in its delivery.

I expected much more in both of these departments from GONZO than what we were given---oh wait, no I didn\'t. The English dub was middle of the road as well, not shit-tier but not god-tier either. Some of the voice actors were better than others but for the most part my only complaints are subjective, so we\'ll move on.Out of everything it seems the characters are what piss most people off about this show. For starters, there\'s a rotating assortment of cast members because they\'re constantly killed off. Because of the wide array of assholes that regularly appear on this fine cartoon, the very few people you can sympathize with (aside from Katou) are minor roles, which sucks because again, in this show being a member of the supporting cast is an instant death sentence. There\'s a lot of varying personalities, some you\'ll like, some you\'ll hate; I think this is probably one of Gantz\'s strongest points because it allows the show to stay fresh, even if it is at the expense of a lot of character development. The 3 people of biggest importance to the plot are:Kurono, the whiny, horny, selfish, impressionable teenager. Probably one of the least likable characters on the show. His development is really haphazard because the second he starts to change in a certain direction, the show waves its floppy dick and fucks the whole playing field up. On the spectrum, he\'s more or less centered between I\'m-a-fucking-psychopath and I-fucking-care-about-everyone, and as such, he can be cool one moment and then act like a flailing dumbshit the next. Really, he\'s whatever the writers need him to be for that specific episode. Personality wise, the most flexible member of the cast.Katou, the big dude with everyone\'s best interests at heart. One of the only glimpses of genuine goodness on the show. Can get really, really fucking annoying when he hinders the progress of the group with his nobility, but at other times he\'s a welcome break from the sea of dickheads this show throws at us. Sometimes loses control and legitimately hurts people (physically). His only reason to really continue on living is to raise his little brother.Kishimoto, ahhh fuck this bitch. IMO the least likable member of the cast, even worse than that fucking serial killer kid or that whiny businessman. This bitch is the worst. Killed herself because her bad grades lead to a strained relationship with her mother or something like that. I don\'t know, it was basically just an excuse for us to see her naked (which is stupid because we saw her naked like 30 other times afterwards). Depends on others for 98% of the show and is always yelling at other people for not doing anything when she herself does the equivalent of masturbating during a house fire. Kept around primarily for fanservice and to create sexual tension. Not exactly emotionally stable but that\'s to be expected considering the circumstances of her death.Did I enjoy this anime? It depends on what you mean by enjoy. Its hard to ""enjoy"" an anime like Gantz in the typical sense, but it was well executed and at times pretty fun to watch, so I\'ll say yeah. Plus it made me laugh multiple times (both intentionally and unintentionally), and in an anime this bleak, I think that counts for something.Overall I give it a 7. Watch it for the black guy, he\'s hilarious.', 'It is not easy to find an anime that keeps you on edge. Something that in which no character seems safe, and nothing is certain. Gantz is one such anime, a relentless monster-busting gorefeast. It takes no prisoners, and even the central characters do not seem safe from harm. However, what Gantz has in intensity and shock, it lacks on plot and theme.Gantz follows high school student Kei Kurono. Kei is a rather selfish teen who’s only goal in life is to get laid, going on record as one of the horniest anime characters of all time. However, this goal goes unmet, as Kei and...childhood friend, Masaru Kato, die saving a homeless man from an incoming train. Unexpectedly, they end up in an apartment room with others who have died, including naked girl Kei Kishimoto, and and a sphere referred to as Gantz. The sphere opens up, revealing racks of black suits and weapons. They are informed that they have been given a second chance at life, but with a catch. They must hunt and kill aliens when called upon by Gantz.Gantz actually has quite a few things going for it. It has a very interesting premise, and an edgy feel. As mentioned before, this is a very violent series. Heads explode, limbs get cut off, people get torn to pieces, and all is shown on screen. Throw in some domestic violence and nudity, and what you have is something not for the sensitive or faint of heart. These elements make Gantz a relentless, gritty urban supernatural thriller.The visuals in Gantz are a strong point. Character designs are reminiscent of people you see in everyday. Business men, gangsters, and other people look as they would in real life, nothing stylized, safe for the gantz suits. The gantz suits actually compliment Kei and company’s character designs well, though they look silly on some characters. The aliens are some of the strangest looking creatures you will see, and of course, the gore is well detailed. The background art is also good, giving the feel of a real city. The music does a fine job of setting the tone for the series , and the opening theme perfectly captures the grittiness on the show. On the technical side, Gantz is solid, if only the same could be said for the writing.The biggest problem with Gantz is definitely the way its themes are handled. It is clear that Gantz wants to say something about society and human behavior, but the message is muddled. In the world this series paints, people are mean-spirited to the point of being unbelievable. There is almost no one willing to help their fellow man, only looking out for themselves. While there is certainly some truth to what Gantz shows about human beings, it comes across as more nihilistic than truthful.Most of the characters in this series are not very likable, most are quite despicable. Kei is one of the most unlikable leads around, he’s selfish, lecherous, and has little to no decency. He does manage to somewhat redeem himself near the end of the series, as he begins to look out for others, though not enough to redeem him completely. Kato proves to be much more likable, if for no other reason than he is the voice of morality in a show that would otherwise be completely devoid of it. His back story, which is of a violent relationship between Kato, his younger brother, and abusive aunt, also gains him some sympathy points. Rounding out the main cast is Kei Kishimoto who, despite being in an interesting situation due to a failed suicide attempt, is the least interesting and explored of the three. The rest of the cast consists of a collection of thugs, psychopaths, and innocent and well-meaning victims of society, all of whom will obviously die.The pacing of this series is another problem. Scenes seem to drag on and on at times. The scenes in the Gantz apartment, in which the new recruits try to figure out what happened to them while the veterans try to explain the situation, are interesting at first but eventually become quite tedious. Just as grating is how long it takes characters to make decisions, even in the midst of battle. Entire scenes are devoted to characters making decisions instead of getting anything done, and it grows tiresome after a while. The plot is stretched thin over 26 episodes and lacks a proper conclusion, making Gantz less than a rewarding experience.If you are simply looking for a thrillingly violent series with strong technical merits, than Gantz is certainly worth checking out. It has an intensity and willingness to show extreme violence that most anime do not come close to. However, if you also seek a well plotted, rewarding experience, there are much better titles that do the same. childhood friend, Masaru Kato, die saving a homeless man from an incoming train.

Imagine a paintball game where all the participants are dumb and become sitting ducks.Episodes drag endlessly, stretching at a slow pace, with all characters doing nothing, stupid, motionless, refraining from even defending themselves even if they are armed with hi-tech weaponry and if they are in the iminence of being hurt/killed by the bad guys. It feels strongly like a horrid NIGHTMARE in which you are frozen, unable to act and everything is out of control due to your own weakness.The aliens are quite something. Surprisingly sluggish grotesque weirdos, who even so eventually manage...to kill the characters due to their lack of decision. They are later replaced by mystical Tomb Raider-style living statues.The CHARACTERS are flat -- a profusion of generic cliches : 1) the big guy who is too soft-hearted to do something (in the best Yasutora Sado-style), 2) the innocent/stupid hot babe who is too scared to do something, 3) the cynical who plays the game all along (this is the one with whom the westerners will probably relate more), 4) the psycho sadist bum-killer who blames the society... and so on. Exception noted for Kurono, who starts as a grumpy selfish teen who evolves into a cowardly fearful selfish teen and then into a not-very-competent reckless teen killing machine.HUMOR pops up every now and then, and when it does it is well done (e.g., the scoring of the points for the dog with hylarious comments). Some acid critic permeates (e.g., the fanatical priest who is blind to the truth, the stupid yuppie who never catches up and is unable to act in the team).The vulgar language, the violence and sexual hints give the illusion that some development is really taking place, but the lack of action is unnerving, they mostly talk and talk, without deciding nothing. If the story was condensed/edited, the 26 episodes (of this two-parter) could easily become 10 or 12.Ah, there is also a sterile melee of criss-cross non-coincident encounters of apparently secondary characters which supposedly have some meaning in the major plan, whatever it may be. And also a faint attempt to create a psychological dimension with the curiosity about the meaning of the ominous ball 8.

It has buckets of Gore, a healthy dosage of nudity and a nice sprinkling of profanity to go along with it.That being said, Gantz really does have a message underneath it's grisly facade, this is actually a much more philosophical anime then people think, most might compare it to Elfen Lied, do not be fooled. I found Elfen Lied to be way over-the-top in content but I felt that they did way to many scenes just for the hell of it.

Ironically, Gantz unfolds after a fatal train wreck kills two of the main characters. It sounds intriguing, yes, but it is really a reflection of the utter barf that is this series.First and foremost, this series has so much profanity that it's akin to listenning to a teenager who has just discoverd the F-word for two hours. The over the top violence makes your stomach roil. Seriously, it's traumatizing. And finally, there's the nudity and boderline porn. Strick that, I'm going to go ahead and just call it porn because for someone who has never seen a...&quot;true&quot; porno, this would likely register as one in his mind.The actual story appears at first glance to be quite interesting.

Gantz presents all of the best elements that a series in the mindless gore genre should provide. It\'s positively chalked full of blood, sex, violence, dark comedy, unpredictably, and absurdity. If you enjoy Robert Rodriquez and the likes of Dusk Till Dawn, Machete, and Planet Terror you WILL enjoy many of things that Gantz has to offer. The most promising trait Gantz has is that it is willing to kill off any character, main or minor, at any time. This creates a very intense suspenseful environment that...very few anime (only Basilisk comes to mind immediately) can compare to. The story is ridiculous and shot full of holes in a very excusable manor considering the genre and intent of the series. To briefly summarize, adults, teens, kids, and even pets die and are transfered to a room where a giant black ball forces them to compete as a team versus varying creatures for survival. In these games, points can be earned through defeating the enemies. Said enemies range from aliens, to dinasours, to whatever other entertaining creatures the writers dream up. Earn enough points and you redeem your life and freedom. However, if you die in the game, you die for real. All of this enables some pretty insane yet entertaining scenarios for the group to face everytime they enter a new game. As I said, anyone can (and will) die at any given time. The unpredictable aura created is great!So why am i giving this title such a low rating despite this praise? Gantz absolutely and inexcusably implodes itself. One major downer of any action series/film is when the hero or villan talks, and talks, and talks when they could have finished their nemesis off. Gantz takes this to a whole new level. I challenge anyone to complete this series without routinely flailing their arms in disgust. The series is full of grouseme creatures literally tearing people limb from limb while their comrades point their guns shaking and exclaiming ""I\'m gonna shoot....here it goes....wait I can\'t...how could I possibly KILL with my own hands...but I\'m gonna.....how can I though?...I gotta! Here it goes!....wait...."" and so on. It really is THAT bad. I feel it could have been acceptable had the hesitation been limited to the first arc while the characters grew to understand their new violent life. But it continues through the entire series and becomes increasingly annoying every time. It really is disappointing that an otherwise grousemly awesome anime is dragged down by such a major flaw. It may be hard to comprehend the severity of this issue until you watch for yourself, but it scinceirly is a deal breaker. In the end the good manages to slightly out weigh the bad warranting a single viewing from fans of the genre. I doubt anyone could sit through a second viewing even if they really wanted to. 6/10 very few anime (only Basilisk comes to mind immediately) can compare to.

I like to see what others have to say before I watch, without spoilers.  I am really glad I decided to watch this anime. I was pleasantly shocked at the beginning and wanting more at the end.  I have yet to watch Gantz: The second stage, but I am starting when I am done with this review.Story:  I gave it a 9 because I really think it deserves it.  There is more than one hidden message in the story and hopefully most of you will see...it, if not, that's okay as well, you will enjoy it. I hate to read reviews with spoilers, so I won't add any. It starts off shocking and isn't for the faint of heart.  If you don't like blood, gore, nudity, profanity, this anime is not for you. There is no sex or romance,  :(  , lol, but thats okay as well.Art:  I think the art could've been done better.  If you watch it online fullscreen, it's kinda choppy. The colors weren't as vibrant as you would expect being horror.Sound:  I LOVED the music. It fit well with episodes and what was going on at that time. There was a lot of that creepy, horror movie magic there.  The beginning starts with Hard Rock or what I think is hard rock and then end is kinda...gentle.Character:  You love them, hate them, pity them and want to smack them.  Some characters made me wanna jump through the screen and beat the crap outta them for their lack of survival skills. You won't see all characters all the time, but we all know the mains pretty much stay. Some you can't wait to leave and others you feel bad when they are gone.Enjoy:  I was really surprised I enjoyed this anime so much. I usually go for an anime with romance, drama, etc.  There were times I was slack-jawed by what was going on.  Sometimes I was rolling with laughter at the stupidity and helplessness a few characters portrayed.  But I really enjoyed it and watched it all back to back in a few hours.Overall:  I think this anime is OUTSTANDING!!!

Released in tandem that year were Elfen Lied and Gantz. Elfen Lied became hugely popular and Gantz...did not. This is despite the fact that Gantz had more blood, more tits, and more realistic art than Elfen Lied. Many critics of Elfen Lied say that it is only popular due to tits and gore, but these people are missing a crucial bit of information in their analyses, the utter failure of Gantz! Gantz has a plot so stupid that an 8 year old on a sugar high could...write a better one in 5 minutes. The characters are either unlikable assholes or bland and forgettable. The soundtrack leaves MUCH to be desired, despite that awesomely terrible J-rap at the beginning. Despite all of this, Gantz could have at least been entertaining if it embraced its own stupidity and became self aware. This worked very well with the absolute batshit insanity that is Hellsing Ultimate. Instead, Gantz too often tries to take itself seriously and fails miserably as a result. The manga at least tries to avoid this, but the anime strives so hard to squeeze in a moral in that insufferable filler arc that the viewer feels like gagging. Don't watch Gantz!

They awake in a room with a giant black ball called Gantz and other people who have died recently. The ball in this room commands them to kill aliens every night within a certain amount of time and with every kill they rack up points. After every night of...killing the survivors do go back to their normal lives for another day before doing all of it all over again the next night. With enough points, they can go back to their normal lives without ever having to participate in the games anymore and they’ll have no memory of Gantz.Gantz has a fantastic setup but it just fails to deliver. The story is dark and shows how cynical the world can be. One of the characters risked his life to save a woman’s child but she didn’t even have the decency to say thank you. But instead of trying to find a balance between that and all the fights the characters get into, the story just focuses on the build up to the fights and the actual battles themselves (which can be entertaining) with only an occasional attempt at being philosophical about human nature and how cruel we can be. The personal lives of the main characters are really really boring, which shows that most of the effort really did go into all the battles.   And it doesn’t seem to bother any other civilians that people who have died recently and were reported dead on the news have suddenly come back to life. The use of profane language is smartly used throughout the show to add some humour and it does lighten the cynical and depressing atmosphere of the story occasionally.ArtThe art of Gantz in a mixed bag. The traditional character designs and animation are great but the mix of CGI objects with 2-D animation just doesn’t work. Maybe if the show was released more recently it would have looked better but it just looks like ugly clay models alongside our characters.SoundThe characters in Gantz shout and yell, a lot. I can tell you this can start to irritate the hell out of you. Kei shouting can make the hairs on your neck stand up. It really gets to you. And it’s not just him, everyone else does this. This is just nitpicking but when someone decides to shout for minutes on end you really want to fast forward or stop watching.The music is okay. Both the OP and ED are forgettable and so is the music used throughout episodes.CharactersThe characters in the story are despicable human beings, most of them anyway. They don’t seem to blink at the idea of killing somebody else. Kei is a pretty awful lead and has absolutely no redeeming qualities to him, in the anime at least. He comes off as whiney, obsessed with sex and just full of himself. This is supposed to be our hero, the guy we root for.I absolutely despise Light from Death Note. Not because he’s poorly written, as a matter of fact he’s a fantastic character. He’s what a villain should be and that’s why I hate him so much, because he’s the perfect bad guy, but Kei on the other hand is not the bad guy.  Kei is like a stand in for the audience, and when the hero is a real douche it makes it a lot harder to take in and follow the story.Another problem I have with the characters is that they have a tendency to repeat something and not do it. For instance, one of them will have a gun, and shout a dozen times “I’M GONNA SHOOT IT!” before actually doing anything. This happens quite a few times throughout the show and it can get really off putting. It also feels like time is being bought to stretch out the length of the episode.Characters die like flies in Gantz so don’t expect a lot of character development. If the character started out as really slutty in the series, chances are, the character will die as someone who was really slutty, the same can be said for everybody else, no matter what type of person they are.EnjoymentGantz is not a good show, but it can be enjoyable up to a certain extent. The battles are really fun to watch even with the uneven animation and the battles really have some suspense attached to it. Since the series ended before the manga, the ending has been discussed numerous times. Gonzo came up with material in the last few episodes that the viewer is supposed to study. Study the ending, the story, how it all came to this etc. But because this is filler, nobody cares and will not waste their time doing it. And since the last arc is non-canonical don’t expect to get a lot of the questions you had with the story answered.Gantz is something I’d only recommend to someone who loves and can stomach mindless violence and gore, with some added sex scenes for good measure. Although don’t expect to be fastened to your seat when watching it and when you finish the show, just forget about what you saw in the last four episodes and continue with the manga.6/10 killing the survivors do go back to their normal lives for another day before doing all of it all over again the next night. With enough points, they can go back to their normal lives without ever having to participate in the games anymore and they’ll have no memory of Gantz.Gantz has a fantastic setup but it just fails to deliver. The story is dark and shows how cynical the world can be. One of the characters risked his life to save a woman’s child but she didn’t even have the decency to say thank you. But instead of trying to find a balance between that and all the fights the characters get into, the story just focuses on the build up to the fights and the actual battles themselves (which can be entertaining) with only an occasional attempt at being philosophical about human nature and how cruel we can be.

Great nudity and violence though!', 'Gantz is a manga written by Oku Hiroya. It enjoyed quite a bit of success getting two anime series, a novel, a video game and two live action movie adaptations. Of course, popularity doesn\'t equate to quality and this is the guy who\'s known for random fan-service and gore of course you can\'t judge a person\'s works just by their reputation. So I guess I\'ll actually have to watch the anime before I make any judgments. Let\'s take a look at Gantz: First Stage.There\'s not so much a story in this as there is a concept. An electronic bowling ball known as Gantz creates copies...of people as they die, somehow getting rid of the original bodies in the process. Gantz then sends the duplicates to live their lives, assuming that they can survive fighting aliens. Okay, this is an interesting concept. There\'s a lot of room for intrigue and plot but, like the anime I reviewed last week, it squanders most of its potential. The first major issue is the aliens. They don\'t seem to be causing any problems, hell they aren\'t even hostile until provoked, but the only one who ever questions whether or not it\'s okay to hunt them is Kato and he quickly forgets about his objections. Are these characters all morons? How could you not question the morality of this situation? Look, it\'s a child-like alien standing there with a green onion, kill it! You don\'t know the situation. Maybe Gantz just hates aliens and you\'re helping it in a genocidal rampage. Stop blindly following the bowling ball with an annoying sense of humour and think for yourselves, Idiots. Another issue is that there are a ton of continuity errors. They\'ll end an episode with a scene, open the very next episode with that scene but done differently for no apparent reason. Or they\'ll close an episode with several characters unarmed and in the next one they\'ll have pulled weapons out of their bags of holding off screen. That\'s just inexcusable. How do you screw up continuity from one episode to the next? Did they just forget how the previous episode went? Another issue is that the anime moves really slowly. I wouldn\'t mind that much, but a lot of what they show is completely irrelevant to the important characters or its a different angled shot of things we\'ve already seen or its showing a scene that we already know everything about that we need to. As an example, female Kei\'s suicide scene. You know right from her introduction that she committed suicide in the bathtub. They don\'t need to show it. The images add nothing except for the information that she cut her wrists wrong. Dammit Kei, you cut vertically along the vein, not horizontally across it. Kill yourself properly next time. This is what causes you problems, you don\'t think. Another thing that bugs me is the humour. There\'s a repeated ""joke"" where the dog tries to lick female Kei\'s crotch and someone inevitably comments that he must be owned by a working girl because we all know that women with jobs can\'t find romance. After all, who would want a significant other with ambition when you can have someone wothless? Wait... what? They also end the final episode with a gay joke. It\'s funny because................................... gay people exist?Let\'s waste no time in looking at the characters. How do they fare, aside from the being too stupid to ask basic questions thing? There are really only three characters worth mentioning. The rest are either one dimensional side characters or fodder. Let\'s start with our hero, male Kei. I will admit that there are some good things about him. He\'s pretty courageous and he has a lot of determination. However, he\'s also a jerk who has no objections to harassing female Kei. To be fair, he never goes over the line into outright sexual assault but he does come pretty close. How are we supposed to sympathise with the guy when he\'s a terrible person? Kato is by far the best character. He\'s got a lot of rage but he also tries to keep it under control and cares about helping others. He\'s a good guy but he also has a darker side. It makes him an interesting character. Why doesn\'t the anime just keep the focus on him? Then we\'ve got female Kei. I don\'t even know where to start with her. Her main purpose is to provide fan-service and to get rescued from rape threats. Yeah, that\'s pretty bad. She has very little personality aside from wanting to support Kato. To be fair, she does get a few good scenes in the very last episode, but it really is too little too late. Come to think of it our only major female characters are her, a stalker with barely any dialogue and an old woman who spoils her grandson. I get the impression that Oku Hiroya has a bit of an unenlightened attitude towards women. Okay, that\'s a pretty massive under-statement.The art is mostly pretty strong. The characters look fairly realistic, except for their eyes. The eyes in this are just bizarre. They\'re almost always drawn so that they\'re looking in two different directions or staring blankly. The gore just looks silly. It\'s like watching one of those low budget independent films where they include obviously fake gore effects, except that this was drawn looking like a bad effect so it isn\'t so much a matter of budget as the artists apparently not knowing what actual blood and guts look like. Another thing that bugs me is the ridiculous amounts of fan-service. Female Kei gets nude scenes in virtually every episode and a lot of them drag on. You know, in case you forgot what breasts look like and need to study them. To the anime\'s credit the fight scenes are pretty interesting and unique. Even if a lot of them consist of one person fighting while everyone else just kind of watches like a lazy moron.The voice acting is really strong. Yamaguchi Megumi, Nabatame Hitomi and Namikawa Daisuke all do really well in the main roles. The music is also really good. If you weren\'t actually watching the screen you might get the impression that afro robots asking for Yuzo is actually dramatic.The yuri factor is a 1/10. This anime doesn\'t even pass the Bechdel test, of course it doesn\'t have yuri.So, how does Gantz fare? Well the concept is really interesting, there\'s one really good character, the art is pretty strong even with the bad gore effects and bizarre eyes and the voice acting and music are really good, but the execution is beyond sloppy most of the characters are twits, there\'s quite a bit of unchecked misogyny and there\'s just a huge number of flaws. Maybe the second season fixes them somewhat, but the first season definitely has more flaws than positive factors. It isn\'t bad, but it\'s certainly not good. I have to give it a 4/10. of people as they die, somehow getting rid of the original bodies in the process.

However, I felt that elfen lied had a much better story line and the story was attmpting to teach us ideas such as forgiveness, love, tolerance of others, tolerance of what we don't understand or expereince, self-refelction, human rights, morality, and irony.Aside from the fact that Gantz did not do any of those things to rectify itself, Gantz also displayed the idea that 'sometimes' murder is justifiable...I decided not to waste any more of my...brain cells absorbing trash.Like the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. brain cells absorbing trash.Like the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out."", ""Action, aliens, crazy wild sex! Yes, these are all elements of the story of Gantz, and what a story it is!The story starts with Kurono Kei, a complete asshole with no regard for the life around him, who dies trying to save the life of a homeless man.Yes, you heard me right and before you call out my contradiction, there were other parties involved.Kurono Kei was described as being a fearless person who was ready to tackle on anything by his close middle school friend Kato Masaru, however, as time went on Kurono slowly starts to drift away from being so fearless and eventually assimilates...into the void of the human nature.He becomes just like every other human being, no longer any different as he once was, just an uncaring, unfeeling person trying to work for only his own benefit in the world.Kato meets up with Kurono one day by accident and finds that his old friend has changed for the worst. The two start to reminisce by the subway station and Kurono notices a drunk old man, he curses at him silently to himself and talks about the filth in the world for a while in his own head when suddenly the man is on the tracks of the subway in imminent peril. Kato, being the fearless wonder boy he is, urges Kurono, whom he had always looked up to, to save the man! Yet, Kurono is no longer the person he once was, he has become detached from his former self. However, he reluctantly goes to help the man off the tracks, but, in doing so, Kurono and Kato are both killed by the oncoming train.When they awake they are not dead, or they are, but they still exist. This is where the story starts to get good.Possibly the greatest part of this anime was the characters. Truly, splendidly done. Wonderful character development as well.Throughout the story it's a constant test of &quot;What are you willing to do to survive?&quot; and it shows the human nature and animal behaviors that show the lengths of our will to survive.While Kurono starts out as someone who would die in this new world he finds himself in, he soon adapts to his new surroundings and overcomes all odds.While the series ends on a bitter note, at least Kurono gets to unleash his carnal desires. And isn't that what life is all about anyway?A great, great, great series that I would recommend to anyone 16 and over. There's a decent amount of blood and nudity, but it's nothing that someone at 16 shouldn't be able to handle.Definitely a guy's anime, but, maybe some girls will like it as well. into the void of the human nature.He becomes just like every other human being, no longer any different as he once was, just an uncaring, unfeeling person trying to work for only his own benefit in the world.Kato meets up with Kurono one day by accident and finds that his old friend has changed for the worst.

Also, I am not a person who watched it for the gore or nudity, but for the story and overall message. I started this anime expecting a disaster. But as I continued to watch the series, paying attention to every detail, I began to feel a thrill that no other anime has offered. It is that thrill that made this anime unique.Gantz was a thrilling adventure about an...average high school student, Kurono Kei, who didn't think about anyone but himself. He was just a perverted kid that thought only about women. But all that changed when he died. Well, I'm not sure if he really died, but that doesn't matter.He was sent to a room with several other people that had similar near-death experiences. In the middle of that room was a large black sphere known as Gantz. This mysterious sphere sent Kurono and his group on various alien hunts. Whoever died was replaced for the next round. Kurono's main goal was only to survive until he discovered that he would be able to go back to his normal way of life if he killed enough aliens.That is the main plot of this series. The strange events that occur along the way are what makes the series stand out from the crowd. If you're bored and can't find anything to watch like I was when I started this series, I suggest you try Gantz out for a spin. If you do, you may get more than you were looking for. average high school student, Kurono Kei, who didn't think about anyone but himself. He was just a perverted kid that thought only about women.

The idea of people dieing and then being transported to a place where they basically have to kill to earn points and win their life back sounds interesting enough, plus after hearing that is loaded with violence, sex, and profanity... nuff said had to give it a shot...But of course this anime went the way of Elfin Lied, alot of hyped up talk, but nothing to back it up. There is no sex in the first 13 episode season.. ill tell you that now, just a lot of fanservice shots,...and the sex that was in the second season.. pointless and was pretty much just put there to keep people watching. The Violence... not really there, yeah you see a few heads explode here and there, but most of the time the first season is pretty much still shots of people being scared to fire a gun. Also there is no real character development in the first season.There is almost no REAL character background for the characters, I guess with a series this short they didn\'t want to waste time and just kinda summed everything up as quick as possible, which would have been fine if they hadn\'t made them all mentally challenged... it\'s like watching a really bad horror movie where everyone is retarded and you get all ticked off at the endless stupidity... I feel that this whole anime can be summed up as follows...Main character: ""hey i\'ve got an erection and im just gonna stand here and watch everything go down and let me friend do all the work (which he won\'t) until the last minute then I\'ll pretend i was of some help after everyone id dead :D, yay i have an erection :D""His friend: ""I have to do something!!!!..... *Stands around not shooting the enemy and lets everyone die*The Girl: ""I have big tits and just like to stand around crying, while people (and a dog) try to rape me all day, but its okay because \'His friend\' will protect me for five seconds then stand around not shooting some more""Everyone Else: ""Hi I\'m your average horror movie retard and I\'m just gonna do the dumbest stuff you could possibly do at every given opportunity, until i die.""Gantz(person ball thing that controls everyone): ""I don\'t really know why I\'m even doing this, we\'re never gonna tell you, but I\'m a rude over-sized bowling ball, that does magic :D""Yeah that about sums it up, there characters are horribly created and their actions and emotions are lame. Please save yourself the trouble and don\'t watch this, you will never be able to get those wasted hours of your life back, The second season picks up a little bit, but not enough to be worth how horrible it still is, I could feel myself dieing a little inside with each episode, but i finished the series for you, the readers, that way i could give a proper review and hopefully no one else will ever have to suffer through this like I did. and the sex that was in the second season.. pointless and was pretty much just put there to keep people watching.

When I started to read it I found myself unable to stop. I thrilled me to no end. When I was finished, I was really sad because I wanted more of gantz, until I found out that they made anime.I started watching it and frankly it ruined the gantz name for me.Half of the things are left out in anime, the other half was just poorly done.Just a poor poor imitation of manga.Ok, I understand. The manga has about 380 chapters,a lot of things are expected to be included, story is huge and they made just 2...seasons.But if you already decided to make 2 seasons of particular manga, shouldn't you at least try to make it as similar as possible as manga?This part ruined it that much that I was very disappointed and I don't recommend it at all.Of course you can try to watch it but I highly recommend manga which is much much better.Not to mention the poor quality of characters as well as series itself.Very very poor. seasons.But if you already decided to make 2 seasons of particular manga, shouldn't you at least try to make it as similar as possible as manga?This part ruined it that much that I was very disappointed and I don't recommend it at all.Of course you can try to watch it but I highly recommend manga which is much much better.Not to mention the poor quality of characters as well as series itself.Very very poor."", '(This review contain minor description of some scenes you may find as spoilers)Gantz ........ Gantz is an horrible anime.I will tell you this: the story has a good setting. My first thought reading the anime synopsis was ""Ok, this sounds good"". Too bad it wasn\'t like that. Gantz fails in almost any aspect it try to deliver.Like I said, the story isn\'t bad, but each episode is extremely slow. The only way I could watch any episode was skipping the much I could from it. The anime start to give a lot information to the watcher without answering any question .The art is...just ... meh. I don\'t know what the budget was but most action scenes were poorly animated ... No, rather, the anime in general was poorly animated. Repetitive scenes, actions scenes where they show the face of each character taking the emotion out, extremely slow camera approaches, and a long et cetera.The sound was the only good thing I can rescue from this disastrous thing. The Opening and ending were quite good. My only problem was the ""Gantz!"" sounds between pauses done by kids; I mean, c\'mon, it\'s a gore anime with a lot of blood, nudity and sex scenes, those kids saying gantz just doesn\'t fit anywhere.Now let\'s move on with the characters: The worst shit this anime has. How can some guys that just die and get teleported to a room don\'t believe anything that people in suits that looks like they know what is going on is trying to say? Why those guys can shoot an alien kid like nothing  but can\'t shoot a giant killer statue that is about to kill one of your friends? Why would someone would want to fight  bare handed a killer alien that you saw killing somebody with one hand in an instant? Why would everybody stay calm when that same alien destroyed the torso of a person in front of you but suddenly in some others situations everybody just gets fucking dumb?.Those are the kind of question you make to yourself in gantz all the time. The character development is horrible: Just a bunch of random memories of the main characters from time to time, that\'s it.The enjoyment was bad. Like I said, is extremly slow, random scenes can appear from nothing and the action scenes were bad.Overall: This thing sucks, this anime sucks, gantz sucks.Notes:- My review and my english probably sucks too.

The anime doesn't do it justice as it barely explains what Gantz is or what its purpose is. It leaves many questions unanswered. Past that, the overall plot kinda sucks at times due...to the characters sticking way too much to their stereotypes... Having too many useless characters makes you go nuts and get pissed off at them and undermines the story. Also, there are a few too many plotholes. For example, the ending.... like wtf it just leaves you hanging and was WAY too abrupt, it was so freaking bad i was like okay where's the next episode, i seriously spent like 5 mins searching for the next one but that was the ending....Also, the anime really goes off track after the Buddhist hunting, so it made up the final hunt for Kurano....doesn't happen in the manga.Art: nothing really amazing here, cgi 2D/3D with the Buddhists you'll notice some really bad animation there.....Sound: god damn the voice actors for both english/japan suck..... however I like the Tanaka aliens and their funny voices LOL THEY EVEN LOOK LIKE MIGHT GUY XDDDDDDcharacter: here i kinda have a problem, the characters act WAY TOO STUPID AND HESITANT like others have said. too many stupid characters do ruin the show.....  and sadly i feel the females are just there for their tits..... that's kinda sad lolOverall, some of the anime is kinda cool and will pull you in, but at other times you'll be bored and want to skip stuff, because the dialogue sucks. to the characters sticking way too much to their stereotypes...

This anime is filled with blood,gore, and constant killings.  Whats so interesting about this series is that anyone can die at anytime.  I actually find this to be a downfall to Gantz.  As soon as I find a character that I don't want to die, HE DIES!!   I like to understand the characters and if they keep dying soon after their background information is given, that information becomes useless.  However, because I don't want to ruin the plot I can't go into detail.Besides...the fact that there is little information on the characters, there is also little information on the weapons.  People just keep pulling out new weapons.....WHEN DID THEY GET THESE??  I mean when they showed them in the earlier scenes they had nothing and in the next clips they have every weapon available.....HUH??By the way: THIS IS NOT AN ANIME FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE A ROMANCE....For some reason I felt I had to list the things I disliked first.  Luckily the good things counteract the bad.  Unfortunately, I watched this anime a long time ago and the easiest things to remember are the things I disliked.The plot is complex, unique, and well done.  Many of the episodes progress slowly, but there is a good share of fighting as well.  The characters are very simple despite the complex plot.  There is the typical male with a hero complex who feels he must do right no matter the consequences.  Then there is the male who feels he is forced to play hero after having pressure applied by the male with the hero complex.  However, what would two males be without a damsel to rescue?? Nothing and that's why the third main character is a beautiful girl.  Two males and 1 female mean one thing, a love triangle.  A love triangle forms, but I don't recall this playing much importance in the plot.  There are other characters as well, but there is no need to list them because a lot of them die =*(.Overall, this is a pretty good anime, but it's only worth watching if you watch the 2nd season with the final 13 episodes.  A lot happens in the second season and I feel it is better than the first season.  The plot is even more dynamic and things happen that you will never expect.  With that said, watch the second season after watching the first season!!Probably not the greatest review, but that's life.

Inside the ball is a creature named Gantz who sends copies of people who died to battle against various alien creatures.Gantz is split into two seasons, and I\'m reviewing the first one. The first season consists of only two of the many missions in Gantz.Story:A blend of science fiction and pure grotesque horror is what you will find when watching Gantz. This show succeeds at stretching the limits to what can be shown on the television, so expect tons of profanity and body...parts. Also, Gantz contains one of the best and shocking beginnings to any anime show.Gantz is brilliant as it primarily focuses on the human element instead of just the story, where realistic people are put in an highly unrealistic situations. Most people would probably react just like the people who are forced to fight for Gantz, and that is the magic of this show. The characters don\'t display flashy moves, but instead show fear and hesitation.Art:Gonzo did a pretty damn good job with the art and animation. The weapons, armor, and aliens featured in Gantz is some of the most original work I have ever seen.Sound:The soundtracks are eerie and set the mood of Gantz perfectly. Even though I tend to dislike rap music, the opening theme song in Gantz is catchy and memorable.Character:The main character Kei Kurono, is somewhat of an antihero, who is pessimistic and frustrated with the world, and I personally found myself relating to Kei.Masura Katou, who is the opposite of Kei, is somewhat naive and tries to ""save"" everyone instead of just himself. Katou actually proves to be a role model for Kei later in the series (in the manga). Nishi, my favorite character, is even more pessimistic than Kei is and has a Darwinist view of society. Nishi has some of the best lines in the show and the manga.Overall:The first season of Gantz is really well done, and follows the manga almost perfectly.

This was going to be my next ""Battle Royale"", yet sadly it missed the mark, flew a few more miles, through a window, and into a thousand dollar vase.The story was intriguing to say the least, but a lack of any substantial plot development by the halfway mark left me waiting for the series to actually get going. The art and sound were fine, nothing interesting, but nothing terribly negative. Then came the characters, who are some of the least interesting, shallow,...and simply boring characters I have ever endured in an anime. The fact that they are terrible people wasn\'t what bothered me, I loved the Droogs from a Clockwork Orange, but they had actual motivation. By the end of GANTZ the protagonist hadn\'t changed in the slightest, and was still the same whiny coward he was in the beginning. The ""monster fights"" generally ended on anti-climatic notes, and I couldn\'t wait to see that ending theme for the last time. and simply boring characters I have ever endured in an anime.

At first u must think I did this as a joke because i rated this series as a 10 . Well I will explain this while I am doing my review of this series . And i mean series and by saying such I mean the second season and the manga and movies too . It will not give out spoilers.IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY RECOMANDATION FOR YOU SKIP TO THE LAST 4 PARAGRAPHS.So lets start with the first season of the anime. Being a gore fan...i liked it from the first episode. This was due to the way the characters died (think this is my only spoiler if u have not seen this anime at all) but the most impressive fact was how the events unfolded. It showed what all the characters thought and the excitement they felt when they thought they will see some one die and their refusal to help someone if that will put them in danger .It can be said that the main character is horrible but here is the thing. Kei suffers a huge change because of the gantz universe he is thrown in . At first he is a no good brat , cynical and perverted . This is showed in the first season which also shows his determination to survive. He does not adapt instantly as in most animes like bleach when Ichigo became  a shinigami his was not at all surprised (i know he would see ghosts before but what the f**k). After he decides to live he is willing to sacrifice everything. While taking part in missions he survives solely by instinct at first.The second season shows the character becoming a killing machine which does not care for moral codes or such petty things. His survival is the only thing that matters.Now as you can see all characters change but the one who suffers the most is Kurono Kei .. as expected from the main character. He is horrible at first but starts to get better in the second season because he becomes a bad ass killer (which i enjoyed to the fullest) and at the end of the season he comes to appreciate life and tries to do his best for the people around him ... well after something happened in the 22nd episode ... that is what changed his mindset .Now let us ignore the last episodes because they suck hard .. it is not an original ending .. it is an alternative ending for the anime . The story goes on in the manga ... which is where I wanted to arrive.The manga shows how lovable the main character is ... risking his life for the person he loves and for all his friends . His resolve to save and protect everyone is quite touching. Kei goes through a huge change .. .from the cynical weak and pathetic punk he was to the hero we all wish to become. And all of this because his willpower .More powerful characters enter the scene but none have the ability to survive without an incredible amount of wepons or sophisticated gadgets that help them dominate the enemy completely.The anime was good but I recomand the manga if you do not want to waste your time ... if you do watch the anime be shure to skip the last episodes .. after the temple mission ends i mean.Now .. I said ill talk about the live action movie too so here it is. Except from the first movie the plot is totally different . Only the characters remain but what happenes is a different story. Like the anime with the alternate ending , here an alternate story is presented and is done quite well. The effects are good and its very entertaining . But unfortunately if u hated Kei in the anime you will hate him too in the begining and maybe the entire time you are watching.As you can see this was not actually a review but more of a recomandation . Skip the last episodes of the anime and continue with the manga ... IT GETS BETTER ... or skip the anime entirely and go to the anime .Watch the movies they are great really except from some acting issues but nothing can be perfect.SO what do I have to tell you other then that ?Kurono Kei develops amazingly even though this is not seen in the anime . Gantz was a series that made me read the manga .. .and believe me I do not read manga unless something impressed me deeply in the anime.If you have  questions feel free to ask me .. I have watched the anime 4 times and read the manga and reading it still so i know this series pretty well . i liked it from the first episode.

The dialogue isn\'t that interesting, and there\'s a lot of it. The characters aren\'t very likeable, and a good bit of conversation (especially when fighting aliens) consists of a drawn...out version of this scenario:A:""I need to shoot this thing."" B:""Yeah, you need to shoot that thing."" A:""I can\'t shoot the thing.""That being said, there are some interesting visuals. Nothing spectacular, but nice enough to keep you interested.

But I can ensure you it is anything but. Gantz is the kind of show you either love or hate. And people tend to love it or hate it for the same reasons.Gantz is filled to the brim with sex, gore, and profanity. This will either be why you hate it, or the reason you love it. As...for me, I absolutely love this show. It is so absurdly hateful and cruel to its characters that you can\'t help but bask in awe of the sheer amount of hate that oozes from the pores of humanity (as represented in the show).Gantz is essentially Japanese MiB with an extremely mature twist. There\'s a mysterious black ball called Gantz that forces recently deceased (and resurrected) Japanese cit is ensure into a life-or-death Battle Royale against aliens.Talk about an absurdly entertaining premise. It holds promise for tons of action. However, the characters spend more time talking and arguing than they do fighting aliens. Each encounter with the absurd kind takes up massive chunks of the 24 episodes (both seasons).This is mostly because the pacing is absurdly slow. If you thought Monster or Shiki were really slow, you have yet to experience the insane pacing of Gantz. Normally slow pacing would be considered a flaw. But like all of Gantz\'s other flaws, I see it as part of the show\'s charm. One positive of the pacing Is that it immerses you in the situation.When I watched this series, I binged it all in one sitting, and it\'s easy to see why. Gantz absorbed me into the world. Where I felt like I was right there next to the characters. And part of why is actually the slow af pacing.Everyone in Gantz is a completely unlikeable, hateful, selfish, degenerate asshole! AND IT IS AWESOME!Many of the characters in Gantz are so unlikeable, that they come right back round to likeable. This is especially the case for the main character, Kei Kurono. Keith started off as a selfish, perverted, asshole douchebag, but he eventually developed into a rather likeable protagonist. Kind of hard to believe, but it happens. Especially in the second season. Keith goes from asshole to pervert to badass to reluctant hero. And man, his development was one hell of a ride.As for the other characters. Kato, his ""best friend"" is the other likeable character. He\'s the only legitimately good person in all of Gantz (manga not included). He is a caring older brother, a good friend, a responsible paragon of sorts. Though he is a bit of a crybaby in the second season (though he had good reasons)Then there\'s Kei Kishimoto. She\'s basically just Tits McGee. She contributes little other than getting in the way (and having big tits). While she is a likeable and memorable character, she didn\'t feel like a very useful character to have around.Other characters include Nishi, the cold-hearted veteran with ruthless resolve (he\'s a bit weird, but I quite liked him), Muroto, a sadistic evil fuck who kills homeless people for fun, and many more.So yeah, the characters tend to be absurdly unlikeable. But once again, that\'s part of Gantz\'s charm. Just like how Gantz itself always makes jokes at the cast\'s expense, so does the anime blow our minds with how cruel it is.Gantz has really dated CG environments blended with 2D characters. It makes for a really jarring visual spectacle. It is very inconsistent. It looks very much like a video game. Boy, do the 3D computer generated environments make everything look absurd. While this would normally be a bad thing, this jarring and inconsistent animation somehow works in Gantz\'s favor.The character designs are cool and stylish. The Gantz suits are especially appealing to look at. The aliens each a have very interesting designs as well, especially the Buddhist Temple Aliens, which have a very artistic look to them.Gantz has a very weird blend of hand drawn and CG animation that looks rather dated by today\'s standards. But regardless, it looks amazing precisely because of this. This being said, Gantz does have some great animation whenever it stops using CGSo? Sub or Dub?Definitely Dub. Dub is better because it more accurately reflects how cruel and heartless the show is. The English voice actors just do a better job at conveying a really hateful, onpbnoxious, and stupid cast. The Japanese version doesn\'t really capture the absurd and ironic awesomeness of the series.The OST is a tricky one. It has so many great tracks that we can hear while watching. But the real problem arises when you try and Google the OST to listen to the full score. The problem being that the OST cannot be found ANYWHERE. Believe me, I\'ve looked far and wide. It is a damn shame that we simply cannot find it. (If you can find it, lemme know).From what we can piece together in the series, the ost is rather kickass.The opening is really fun and gets you pumped up. It\'s much like a warmup routine. It gets you prepared for the various absurdities and emotional gut-punches you will experience. And the ending theme has a certain appeal to it, as it is slower and allows you to rest.Gantz is an anime with tons of problems, but i cant help but love its bravado. These ""problems"" would be legit were it any other series. BUT THIS IS GANTZ! The problems don\'t work against the show. They, more or less, add to the experience I stead of taking away.Joking aside, Gantz is a show with some really emotional and sad scenes scattered throughout, as no character is safe from death. However, other than that, Gantz can\'t help but make me smile at how damn awesome Gantz is.I give the entire Gantz anime series a 8/10.Thanks for rreading. for me, I absolutely love this show.

Without this ridiculously slow pacing, I could have potentially rated this a 7, 8, or maybe even higher. Dropping the rating down to a 3 may seem extreme, but the amount of time wasted with nothing happening was bad enough to make me stop watching, even after bearing through many episodes waiting for it to pick up.First the good. The...story takes place in darker, grittier version of the real world where everyone seems to be selfish and inhumane. Through some events that can be best described as horrific, the characters find themselves in an unexplained supernatural situation. What is interesting is the despite the absurdity of the situation, the characters must deal with it or die, and they know as little about it as you the viewer does. Those who can\'t get over how ridiculous the situation is die. This brings you to accept the situation and sympathize with the characters as you and they try to figure it out.The characters are very unlikeable. They are annoying, stupid, and unreliable, and remind me of horror film characters that act badly, do stupid things, and get killed. So unlikeable characters here is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it may be intentional. I was sometimes so annoyed with the characters that I wanted them to die as I cursed at them. So seeing them get killed wasn\'t heart-wrenching, but rather was satisfying.But now the bad... The story goes slower than anything I\'ve ever seen. And it\'s not just slow advancement of the story. Rather, it is pointless moments of nothing at all happening. Every time something ""shocking"" happened (shocking only to the characters apparently, not the viewer), you would have to watch each and every one of the 8 or so characters give a surprised look and say ""OH!"", one by one, with a unnecessarily long delay between each one. Multiple times in each episode, the screen would show something mundane like a street light for about 8 whole seconds, for no reason at all, and not even as a transition between scenes, but truly for no reason. Perhaps they though this added suspense, but it doesn\'t come close.What could have EASILY been compressed down to one episode without losing any content (dialogue, action) instead was somehow stretched over 3 episodes. After watching some episodes, I sat there in disbelief over how nothing actually happened in the episode. They are at the same point as they in the last episode, literally in the same spot, with the same objective, in the same continuous time-frame. Whole episodes seemed to consist of watching powerlines/stoplights, characters being indecisive, acting surprised, and watching scenes that were more like still pictures than animation.So this interesting story which had me curious was destroyed by the emptiness of the episodes. Perhaps the best way to watch this would be to fast forward to the points where something actually happens. story takes place in darker, grittier version of the real world where everyone seems to be selfish and inhumane.

Perhaps the best way to watch this would be to fast forward to the points where something actually happens.', '(Editor’s note: This was originally going to be a review of both seasons, however, considering my vastly differing opinions of the two, I will review them separately.)Gantz…… What an experience. After reading several reviews and reading what the story was about, I had no idea what to expect. It’s a battle royale, for one. Neat! I’ve always been a fan of those types of storylines. But apparently, the show also suffers from Elfen Lied syndrome, where the show consists of little more than brutal violence and female nudity. Going into it, I knew that it was going to be bad (I hated Elfen Lied,...and Gantz is a Gonzo anime), but I still wanted to like it.Gantz was a show that I will never forget…… For better or worse.-Story & Characters-Taking place in modern day Japan, our protagonist, Kei Kurono, is your typical high school student. The show opens up with…… him sitting in his classroom and fantasizing about all of his female classmates completely naked (I’m not making this up). After the obvious (and pointless) fan service, Kei walks to the subway and meets up with his childhood friend, Masaru Katou. The two of them talk for a bit, and all of a sudden, a homeless man falls onto the train tracks. Being the do-gooder that he is, Katou jumps in to save him, while Kei, out of guilt, follows him. They manage to rescue the homeless man, but Kei and Katou were not able to make it in time, and ended up getting killed by getting hit by the train. In a bizarre twist of fate, however, they wake up in a room filled with people and a giant black ball. It is soon revealed that everyone in the room has died, and must now participate in a battle royale, conducted by Gantz, the giant black ball. Gantz gives everyone a black suit and an arsenal of weapons. These black suits grant the participants great strength, allowing them to jump great heights, and survive attacks that would otherwise kill them. Gantz will transport everyone to a certain part of the city that they live in, and their goal is to kill the target monster(s) that appear within a certain timeframe, and if they manage to do so, they will be transported back to the apartment, and any injuries that they may have sustained are fully healed, and they are free to leave. However, it’s not as simple as all that, as Gantz will randomly transport them from the real world to the apartment to fight in more battles.The setting and concepts of Gantz are easily one of the most intriguing that I have ever seen. Unfortunately, the execution falls flat on its face due to the awful dialogue, terrible characters, and needless nudity and sex. Let’s star from the beginning: The dialogue.This anime’s dialogue contains some of the most disgusting and needless cursing to have ever been conceived. Imagine if this review were written something like this:“This f**king anime is the best mother**king anime that I have ever f**king seen in my entire f**king life. This f**king anime is the f**king best sh*t ever, and god f**king dammit, I f**king loved this mother f**king anime………. F**k.”That’s what the dialogue consists of, and I don’t mind cursing, but for the love of god, this is a whole new extreme. There’s so much of it, in fact, that it’s actually offensive, and it comes off as juvenile and immature.Moving onto the characters, these people are some of the most obnoxious, morally reprehensible human beings that I have ever seen. There are maybe one or two tolerable characters, but the good majority of them are awful, and I hated them. The ones from the biker gang are the worst, as the majority of the excessive cursing comes from them, and they’re all selfish jerks. Of course, as stated before, there are some good ones, such as Katou, who has a Shirou Emiya complex (Minus the depth), and feels like he has to save everyone. He’s actually a fairly interesting character, since he goes to such great lengths to help his little brother. The two of them live with their abusive aunt, who constantly physically and emotionally abuses them. Kei Kishimoto, a girl whom the characters meet in episode 1 (And also shares the same first name as Kurono), was also another character who wasn’t reprehensible, and her backstory (Or, at least, the little that we got) was actually fairly sad, and made her sympathetic. Kurono, on the other hand, is rather hard to describe. My problem with him was his sudden change in personality. In episode 1, he is a selfish, egotistical prick, but after that, he becomes a rather nice guy, despite saying and doing some questionable things here and there. It was as if it wasn’t even the same person anymore. To be fair, I would much rather him be this way, as he was a total jerk in episode 1, but his sudden personality shift didn’t sit well with me.And last, but certainly not least, is the nudity and sex. For the love of all that is good and holy, there is a lot of excessive nudity. One such scene is in the beginning. The first thing that you see (As mentioned before) is Kei sitting in class and fantasizing about every female student and his teacher completely naked. Why are we seeing this? What’s the point? While he’s fantasizing, he becomes sexually aroused, and some girl yells to everyone “Teacher! Kei has a hard on!” Ok, I have several problems with this. First of all, again, what is the point of this scene? Literally the only thing that we’re learning is that Kei is a teenager with natural urges…… That’s it. Let’s also take a second and analyze this scene logically. How was the girl sitting next to him able to spot this? It’s not like it was bulging and coming out of his pants. Also, how was the girl so quick to notice this? Were her eyes on Kei down there the whole time? This whole scenario makes no sense. And this scene happens more than once.The story of Gantz is broken up into two parts: The real world segments and the Gantz missions. The former delves deeper into the lives of the main characters, and shows their home life, as well as the interactions between each other. Here, we see Katou’s awful backstory. The abuse that him and his brother both endure is hard to watch, and at times even heartbreaking. The lengths that he goes to, to help his brother is one of the best aspects of the show. I also found the relationship between Kei and Kishimoto to be very entertaining. The young, hot Kishimoto has no home, and asks Kei if she can stay with him for a while. Their interactions are very amusing and fun to watch, and are even intense at times. However, we then have the Gantz missions. Whenever Gantz transports the main characters back to the apartment, they meet up with new people each time. The Gantz missions all follow the same pattern: Get transported, explain the situation to the new participants, they don’t believe them, they don’t wear the suits, they die. Rinse and repeat. It’s all very predictable and repetitive. While I didn’t mind the three main characters, I found each new character in the Gantz missions to be absolutely insufferable. What’s ironic is that the concept of the Gantz missions were the most intriguing parts of the show, yet I found it to be the show’s weakest aspect, as they were all very formulaic, with very few interesting things happening in them.The story of Gantz is a mixed bag. While it has a lot of good ideas and some really great moments from time to time, it also suffers from predictable battles, terrible characters, and cringe-worthy dialogue, and its excessive gore is little more than shock value. It’s a story that I really wanted to like, but just couldn’t. What a shame.-Visuals & Sound-I actually have to give Gonzo props here. I won’t lie to you and say that the show looks amazing or anything, but Gantz is actually a fairly decent looking show. The animations, while a bit off at times, are adequate enough, and the monsters, while strange-looking, are all nicely drawn. Slightly above average is the best way to describe the visuals.Aurally, the show, just like the visuals, is above average. It sports a solid soundtrack with a lot of rockin’ electric guitar tracks, some somber piano pieces, and a nice acoustic guitar tune thrown in for good measure. The dub is a bit of a mixed bag, with a lot of good performances, but a lot of weak ones, as well. Christopher Ayres does a really good job as Kei, and after watching the whole show, I can safely say that I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else doing his voice, and Shannon Emerick does an equally good job as Kishimoto. Katou’s voice, on the other hand, was questionable, and I found the biker gang characters’ voices unbearable (Luckily enough, though, they didn’t stick around for long). Dub or sub, it’s up to you for this one.Gantz only features on opening, and it’s one of the most irritating openings since Another, which is one hell of an accomplishment. Skip this opening, unless you’re a glutton for punishment. The song that plays during the end credits, however, is beautiful, and is vastly superior to the terrible opening.-Conclusion-Gantz was a very…… interesting experience. Despite its good ideas, it falls flat in nearly everything that it does. I wanted to like it, I really did. In fact, I sometimes think to myself “You like Gantz! You like Gantz!” The second season, however, is a vast improvement, and a review will be coming soon.Gantz is a hard recommendation, unfortunately, and I can only recommend it to people who must watch every anime to have ever been made, ever.+Story had potential+Non-Gantz missions are decent+The three main characters are cool+Decent visuals+Good soundtrack+Solid dub-Gantz missions are predictable-Awful dialogue-Terrible supporting cast-Excessive blood and gore-Needless nudityFinal score:3/10 and Gantz is a Gonzo anime), but I still wanted to like it.Gantz was a show that I will never forget…… For better or worse.-Story & Characters-Taking place in modern day Japan, our protagonist, Kei Kurono, is your typical high school student.

It sports a solid soundtrack with a lot of rockin’ electric guitar tracks, some somber piano pieces, and a nice acoustic guitar tune thrown in for good measure. The dub is a bit of a mixed bag, with a lot of good performances, but a lot of weak ones, as well. Christopher Ayres does a really good job as Kei, and after watching the whole show, I can safely say that I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else doing his voice, and Shannon Emerick does an equally good job as Kishimoto. Katou’s voice, on the other hand, was questionable, and I found the biker gang characters’ voices unbearable (Luckily enough, though, they didn’t stick around for long). Dub or sub, it’s up to you for this one.Gantz only features on opening, and it’s one of the most irritating openings since Another, which is one hell of an accomplishment. Skip this opening, unless you’re a glutton for punishment. The song that plays during the end credits, however, is beautiful, and is vastly superior to the terrible opening.-Conclusion-Gantz was a very…… interesting experience. Despite its good ideas, it falls flat in nearly everything that it does. I wanted to like it, I really did. In fact, I sometimes think to myself “You like Gantz! You like Gantz!” The second season, however, is a vast improvement, and a review will be coming soon.Gantz is a hard recommendation, unfortunately, and I can only recommend it to people who must watch every anime to have ever been made, ever.+Story had potential+Non-Gantz missions are decent+The three main characters are cool+Decent visuals+Good soundtrack+Solid dub-Gantz missions are predictable-Awful dialogue-Terrible supporting cast-Excessive blood and gore-Needless nudityFinal score:3/10', ""TURN IT OFF! I HATED IT!Of all the shows I've ever watched, Gantz is the only one I mentally realized I found revolting but that I needed to finish as to present a complete picture of the series.Our hero is Kurono or some sort of spelling close to that, a character that I at first appreciated for that the fact that he was a pervert and we got to see an unapologetic look at him in all his mediocrity.Then the plot gets started and he ends up in a room full of strangers, learning he has to hunt aliens to survive. Good potential for...a mixture of conflict within and without the group.The delivery however fell so flat you could feel your nose getting pushed up into your brain as you hit the concrete.Do you like recaps? How about characters endlessly repeating what's going on around them ad naseoum and do nothing to change the situation but talk about it? If neither of these appeal to you, for the love of anything don't watch this. a mixture of conflict within and without the group.The delivery however fell so flat you could feel your nose getting pushed up into your brain as you hit the concrete.Do you like recaps?

They shouldn\'t have been split up in the first place, in my opinion, so I\'m rolling it into one.Ah, Gantz...the only series I\'ve seen with an overall rating that seems to contradict my feelings.Let me break it down.Gantz is technically terrible. The pacing is weird and jerky, the characters are range from bearable to god-awful, the animation is mediocre, and the ending is literally not an ending. It\'s like the studio and writers got so sick of it they just dropped it to move on to something else, hoping...Gantz would be forgotten.For the most part, it was, and that\'s probably a good thing.But get this. I fucking loved this show. I believe a large part of that was due to watching the dub which greatly intensified the horrific script and outrageous voice acting. How many times do they say ""fuck""? I\'d need to be more than a six armed dyclonus to count on my fingers.Gantz is a show you can put on and feel like you\'re watching Cartoon Network\'s Toonami again. You can turn away from your computer, leave the room, paint your nails, come back and still not miss anything cause they\'re still yelling at each other over who\'s going to shoot the alien.Even the humorous aspects don\'t sum up my sheer enjoyment for this catastrophe. Something about the show still allows you to get involved in the characters, even if every single one of them is a piece of shit. The ecchi aspects also lent themselves well, although it was some of the creepiest, most comical ecchi I\'ve seen. And despite much of the awful voice acting, some of it was actually quite good; Chris Patton as Nishi was to die for. While the animation was subpar the character designs were good. Same artist as Ergo Proxy and Ai no Kusabi. The music was also pretty kickass, and it pains me that they didn\'t release an official OST.I thought the show was funny and disturbing, but I\'m really not sure if that\'s how it was meant to come across. I have a feeling that it was supposed to be a more serious show, focused on human nature and battle-royal-esque scenes, but if that\'s all I\'d gotten from it I wouldn\'t have enjoyed it nearly as much.All in all, I still can\'t entirely explain my love for Gantz. The best I can do is to say that while it\'s a technical and literal trainwreck, it\'s hella cool. Gantz would be forgotten.For the most part, it was, and that\'s probably a good thing.But get this.

This studio while having some interesting projects like Basilisk or speedgrapher it is mostly know for it's really bad anime like the first Hellsing anime and this one. Now, Gantz is considered one of the most thrilling and amazing manga of the decade yet this anime is one of the worst adaptations ever made. The story is really stupid. I mean a survival game fighting... aliens? What are we on ''Men in black?'' But I let it that slide because back in the 2000's aliens  were a really popular thing in movies and television. But apart...from that the story doesn't have a descent progress. One time  you are seeing the protagonists fighting aliens in a gory survival game and then you are  seeing their everyday lives. And they were so stupid that you are actually wondering if the writers were serious when they were writing this. The only thing that restrained me for putting a lower score to the story was because of the last episode . It seemed like the writers did a tremendous try to make a dignified last episode to end the first season. They didn't exactly manage it but the results were certainly better than all of the previews episodes. One other bad thing that I should point out about this anime was it's horrible animation. Even though the anime is a 2004 production Gonzo did a terrible job even for this years standards. The animation and the aesthetics were so bad that my eyes hart in a lot of moments by its bad quality. In the sound sections things weren't better. Daisuke Namikawa in one of his firsts leading roles didn't manage to convince me as the anti-hero Kei Kurono. Same goes with the other two not so well known voice actors Masashi Oosato as Masaru Kato and Hitomi Nabatame as Kai Kishimoto. There were some good performances in secondary roles but nothing really special. The opening was really good when I first heard it I said 'wtf is this shit'' but after a while it becomes really catchy and makes up your mood. The ending was really uninteresting.The character of this anime were some oof the worst I have ever seen. Kurono is an annoying little prick, Kishimoto is more useless than ten Orihimes and twenty Hinatas together and Kato is just plain and boring as the good guy that doesn't want anyone to die. There were a couple of interesting roles but the anime was not giving them enough screen time to see their development. Speaking of development this anime had zero in it's characters. There was a little bit near the end but it was really rushed and  predictable.  I hope the characters will be more developed in the second season. To summarize, Gantz is  not a good anime but it was kinda enjoyable to watch it and tell how bad it is in every spectacle. That's why I put a five in the enjoyment section. Nevertheless, it manage to make me want to watch the second season mainly because I want to see if this is  going to be any better. I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone but I have to watch the second season too, so that I can  have an opinion as a whole. from that the story doesn't have a descent progress.

Gantz had everything any anime fan or emo person could want, Twisted Plot, Amazing desgin, blood, gore, nudity and the occasional awkard ness with a hot chick. If you liked elfen lied or any hentai ever made with action in it, then this anime is for you. I absolutely loved it and Im still reading the manga.P.S. I know where you can read the manga for free online, the only problem is that it comes out like, every 2 - 3 weeks, and its annoying to wait for such a materpeice. Messege me for the link. "", 'Please note that this review reflects my thoughts of the complete series and not the separate halves. With that said, on with the review.Oh fun, another dud from Gonzo I get to rip apart. Gantz came out in the same year as Elfen Lied in delivering a brutally violent anime with enough gore and nudity to go around. But while Elfen Lied at least had a decent story and meaning to elements of its violence and nudity, Gantz is enough of a mess in its storytelling and what it was trying to depict.The series is set up to feature those killed in various ways being...brought back from the dead to be forced into a game of survival by a mysterious metal ball named Gantz to kill off various aliens. Don\'t bother expecting any answers as to what the survival game is all about and what are up with the aliens, as the series is mostly focused on the various aliens that the Gantz team members have to fight off and there is very little focus on what their purposes are and why they are bringing people back from the dead just to put them through a survival game against aliens. Much of the violence in the series comes from the gory ways in which the various aliens and players of the game get offed, which Gantz makes enough of a spectacle of outside of its nudity and sexual content (with some occasions of near-rape and being molested by a dog).To a great extent, the characters in Gantz are depicted to be the lowest within society from criminals to mentally disturbed teens. With exception to Katou (whose story saves this from being a complete dud for me), mostly every character in this series is either quite shallow in depth, completely worthless and/ or enough of a complete scumbag with their acts where you could care less about them. This is especially bad as the male lead of the series, Kei Kurono, is a selfish pervert of a teen aroused by any attractive woman he encounters and the moment I seen him more turned on from seeing a naked Kei Kishimoto about to be raped than concerned for her well being had me hating him from the start of the series. The series also has a bad enough habit of having some of the latest ""additions"" to Gantz gawking like a bunch of idiots at the sight of the aliens instead of either fighting them or running off scared. If many of these people are supposed to be depicted as real-life humans, then the makers of Gantz have done a poor job in convincing me these are folks I could identify with.Visually, Gantz does offer a great amount of visual detail in the designs of its characters and scenery, with the former seeming quite realistic in how they were made. The action scenes are engaging to see with the Gantz players being up against alien threats with occasional implementation of CG animation and some noticeable shortcuts. The music used in this series makes use of a gritty hip-hop song for the OP, a soft ballad for the ED and a mix of orchestrations and clanging sound effects for insert music. They do their part to enhance the mood of Gantz, but they don\'t really have anything that stuck out for me.Overall, Gantz is mostly mindless in its focus on the survival game that Kurono, Katou and others go through. With most characters being shallow or unlikeable, a barebones plot and way too much glorification of its gore and sexual content, Gantz isn\'t a series worth hopping into unless you are going into it for the third mentioned element to its presentation. brought back from the dead to be forced into a game of survival by a mysterious metal ball named Gantz to kill off various aliens.

Oh well...The first two or three episodes were really interesting and teasing for me. I noticed high quality of animation and expected exciting plot based on popular yet not used out conception ""survival-game"". I thought it would be something like ""Cube"" movie, with secrets and psychological analysis. But after that...I started to understand something was wrong when the green-Frankenstein-like-clawed-monster ran after characters for about 3 episodes in a row, spilled a lot of blood (well, generally, I\'m not against violence, I loved it much in Elfen Lied, Afrosamurai and all that), and the Almighty-Heroes just held their Mega-Blasters and ranranran....And for half an episode the main char couldn\'t kill trapped monster... well, I\'ve seen lots of sentimental Hollywood blockbusters where superheroes can\'t kill people... But damn, they don\'t hesitate for SO long! In fact, they simply don\'t have so much time, american time is too expensive.And now, as I woke up after sleeping (I mean ""watching-these-last-pathetic-episodes-where-characters-still-didn\'t-learn-how-to-fire-their-guns""), I can remember two real advantages of this anime: energetic opening theme and cute big-breasted chan (looking at her I understand this perv K-chan with constant erection, hehe). They say manga is better. Well, I\'ll try to read, I\'ll really do my best... until someone else says ""No, I can\'t shoot them"".

YES THAT IS POSSIBLE.The characters will stand around doing NOTHING, even while their friends are getting killed, just sitting there asking themselves if they should do anything or crying to themselves full of self pity, when they could easily solve the problem.This is something that is impossible to understand until it has been seen, the pace is absolutely maddening at times.Summary:Pros:Boobies (why it got a 2, not a 1).Actually an interesting premise, just horribly executed.Cons:EVERYTHING else.Just read the manga if you are really interested.If you\'re here because of the manga, do yourself a favour and don\'t ruin it\'s memory by watching this. my personal preference, but it just looked bad.If you watched it(please don\'t) you would see what I mean; the scenery is rendered in some 3D program separate from the characters and the camera moves through it, it looks really awkward.Then there are the characters.They constantly contradict themselves and don\'t make any fucking sense.I don\'t know if this is Gantz\'s idea of ""character development"" or something, but sometimes a character will just do something that completely goes against everything they have stood for or said throughout the rest of the episodes with no explanation.However, much worse than either of those is the pacing.Some scenes go slower than a DBZ fight...

He's obsessed with porn, and only interested in getting laid. And the story is very slow paced. However it will get more interesting as you continue watching.

"", 'Now, this is a different story from your everyday wholesome and innocent series. But I wouldn’t say it is a breath of fresh air. And let me just say that this is definitely not for someone with a faint heart.There’s a long review coming………About the STORYFirst, let me just say that I am so fascinated with psychological type of series but I am absolutely not very fond of gruesome series. I know very well that some of psychological series are accompanied with gore and gruesome killings but I just think that it is not healthy for the subconscious mind. With that said this series still...has a very unique and interesting plot which is why I got interested in the first place despite its gruesomeness. It is definitely not a wholesome series with all the dark elements of it. Despite having too much gore, the plot is interesting enough to make you want to follow the flow of the story as to know the truth behind all the mysteries. Let’s admit it, stories about a set of complete strangers fighting together in a somewhat survival game is always a sure hit. Anyone would always wonder on the whats, whys, whens and hows on the story. What the hell is happening? Why are they chosen? When will the game ends? How the story will unfold in the end? And when you are already on these questions then you are indeed interested already with the series and will surely follow it. It might look cheap with all the gore but unlike others where you’re already at the 100th episode and it still boring, this series will surely get your attention from the very first 10 minutes of watching it which I strongly believe is one of the important qualities a series should have. And this is coming from someone who hates gruesome series so much. Still, the drama is really so cheesy and over the top. It’s very hypocritical.About the CHARACTERSThe disgusting side of human being is very much shown here which unfortunately makes the characters somewhat realistic. There’s a wide range of characters; a very hypocrite guy, an extremely irritating and useless girl, a perverted guy, an extremely bitter guy, and there’s even a dog involve. But one thing for sure, there’s not even a single decent character. All of them can be very irritating most of the times. Well, that’s to be expected because of too much profanity in this series. Like I said, it is what makes it very realistic. Though, I said that, I still strongly believe that human beings are not that bad as the series portrays them. I guess it is a little bit too much. I really like that the characters literally took so much time before getting used with the survival game because unlike others where as if magic, the characters can already kick butts the moment the survival game starts. It details how the characters little by little learn to survive the mess-up game. This way the storylines are more realistic and believable. Though, that makes the storyline somehow flow in a very slow pace. Well, at the end of everything Gantz is the worst of all and I really hate him!About KURONO KEIEven the main lead could be considered the worst type of character much less a decent enough protagonist. He’s the type who doesn’t care about others and would just move if there are no choice at all. He also tends to become so arrogant. Plus he is extremely perverted. Most of the time, he thinks nothing but sex. The worst of all, the second he got dumped, he just had sex with the most available woman. He’s a very good example of anti-hero character. Though, some anti- hero can still be amazing and memorable like Lelouch, Sebastian, and of course LIGHT YAGAMI. They are indeed can be really irritating but it is no doubt they are amazing enough that you would remember them even after so many years but Kei is just an anti-hero character, nothing amazing about him but instead my irritation for him is tripled. Seriously, there are even times when I really wanted for him to just die. The funny thing is, he’s one of the lamest protagonists I’ve ever seen and one of the worst characters of the series personality-wise but for some reasons he always end up looking so cool in every mission.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDI don’t know much about CGs but the animation is very different from the typical anime. It is very interesting and could even consider like from a movie. It is no doubt made so amazing. You can really feel that it is a science-fiction series from its animation. The uniforms are really cool as well. The sounds are just great and so cool. It really compliments the science-fiction theme of the series.There is no doubt that this series is one of the most exciting series I’ve ever seen. Every episode is just exciting and anticipating. In fact, among all the gore series I’ve seen, this is the best made. HOWEVER, I definitely wouldn’t consider it amazing. Even for someone who have seen so many series with profanities, nudities, and gore, this is still too much to the point of I am more disgusted by it than amazed. The exciting and interesting part of this series is overwhelmed by the too much profanities, tragedies and worst characters in it. It is unique in many ways and some elements of it are really well made but it is not amazing or memorable at all that would even compete with some of the average series of today. has a very unique and interesting plot which is why I got interested in the first place despite its gruesomeness.

It is unique in many ways and some elements of it are really well made but it is not amazing or memorable at all that would even compete with some of the average series of today.', 'The first episode I was like ""DAMN this show is going to be amazing"". It really had so much potential with the way it went but it had horrendous execution. I really don\'t like spoiling key plot points as the mystery in the beginning is what\'s supposed to draw you in. It did for me until it was bottled down with very slow pacing and irritating characters. Also it unnecessarily throws around naked chics which might seem cool at first but it gets old very quickly. I did not like this fan fair one bit.Overall I would say pass on this anime. But if...you can forgive the slow pacing and simply irritating characters, it might end up with a satisfying conclusion. I could not make it through it though. you can forgive the slow pacing and simply irritating characters, it might end up with a satisfying conclusion. I could not make it through it though.', '*Warning I\'m coming in biased towards the Manga, but due to that I also wanted to enjoy the anime extremely bad.*Story-Most of the story of Gantz plays on the moral decisions the main characters must make. Although a lot of the intensity from Gantz is trying to push the viewers sense of morality and sensibility as well. Meaning. They don\'t really hold much back here. There\'s profanity, Gore and sex. And plenty of it. You also have a lot of pointless dialogue. I would be willing to bet if they would have cut half of the aforementioned -Guy1:""shoot guy!""Guy2:""I\'m gonna shoot!""Alien: kills guy 3Guy1:""you...really need to shoot guy!""Guy2:""I\'m really gonna shoot guy!""Alien kills both guy 1 and 2 and a girl.Girl\'s assets are exposed at death.They would have lost about 8 episodes worth of time. Seriously that\'s just about every battle scene. So by the time any character almost reaches a decision. You don\'t really care who dies as long as they move on to the next scene. That being said. Gantz does well enough to make you feel for the characters separate from those occasions.Art-The animation is pretty good keeping in mind when it came out. Most scenes and characters are polished and have a good feel to them. Though apart from characters the way they decided to animate camera shifts and some objects is strange to say the least. Maybe a better word would be cheap. A scene will look decent such as the first subway scene. Then they\'ll either zoom and the image will distort in quality or the other objects don\'t keep up with the background when the camera shifts. Apart from that it\'s really clean and easy to watch.Sound-Gonna be honest. I really don\'t remember much of the soundtrack besides ambient scifi music. Which fit but isn\'t memorable. So I gave it a mid grade. Got the job done. But nothing special.Character-As far as characters go Gantz really goes from one stereotype to another. That can be good or bad at times. Where it really pulls is when characterA is clearly a stereotypical thug 70% of the time. But then circumstances cause a change in character and said stereotype becomes slightly less stereotypical. That\'s only for a few characters though.Enjoyment-I enjoyed it when things had proper pacing. But most of the time it\'s like ascending a roller coaster and when you hit the top and prepare for your descent. It plateaus. Except everything outside of the Gantz game. The pacing there is pretty realistic.Overall-It\'s not bad, but it\'s not necessarily great either. It is different and you probably won\'t find something much like Gantz out there. It\'s a good sci-fi to some extent, but in reality it focuses much more on the human element. I\'d advise most people to skip the anime and go for the manga. Not to be punny. But as a sci-fi title the Manga and anime are worlds apart. The manga is easily one of my top 5. The anime on the other. I highly doubt I\'ll be watching it again anytime soon.

If at all.', 'Gantz had potential but it is quite disappointing and also frustrating at times. The story initially appears to be quite interesting until it continues into the next episodes due to the following reasons:1. Characters- There are many characters who are incredibly stupid, useless and one-sided causing quite a lot of frustration during the whole screen time. The main character, Kei Kurono is no better. He\'s a totally hesitant and whiny idiot throughout the entire anime and it soon gets to the point that you feel like punching him in the face to get some sense into him.2. Dialogue and action- Dialogue is no better...in Gantz. The most annoying quote throughout the anime is ""I\'m gonna shoot it!"" because it takes at least 10 minutes before they can even fire their weapons by then, where most of them are dead because the monsters kill them. This is very frustrating throughout the show. Another major problem with the dialogue is that it is quite boring which makes you feel like skipping parts of the anime.3. Genre- Gantz is classified under the psychological, horror, sci-fi, action and supernatural. However, Gantz fails to deliver a psychological aspect because it doesn\'t go in depth regarding the thoughts of the characters. Action isn\'t really action in Gantz as well because so many of the characters stand around waiting for someone to kill the monsters before they get wasted without even inflicting any major damage on the aliens. Horror is done relatively well compared to the other genres with many of the deaths involving graphic explosions of blood and body bits.4. Animation- The animation is ok. Nothing superb about it.5. Storyline- Some parts of the storyline are good but most of them are not. Gantz explores human nature and it portrays how cruel and indifferent humans can be. The story initially catches interest with humans being teleported to a room where their mission is to kill aliens with special powered weapons however the fights drag on for a very long time (the fighting is also crap).6. Sound- Sound is also not great. There\'s a lot of shouting from the characters which gets annoying especially when they are just standing around. The op song is fine as its quite catchy.Recommendation: Don\'t bother watching this, there are much better anime to watch if you want excessive gore and violence. This anime is not for those scared of blood. in Gantz.

They didn\'t explain and develop well the characters because they were not good characters. They were simply not humans, didn\'t had emotions or anything. They just kill and kill.[spoiler] When I think about titles like Elfen Lied and Battle Royale, they\'re violent, but they succeed because...the protagonists at least have something to them that makes them human. There\'s something about them that you identify with, that despite all the horrible things they do, you can tell they\'re trying to rise above it. Just because circumstances force them to become monsters, they don\'t have to stay that way -- they can redeem themselves or at least try.

Through a chance meeting with an old friend he is killed and wakes up in a room with an assortment of strangers and a mysterious black sphere.

Perhaps not the best, but very different. More mature content than the average series, with gore, slime and tits everywhere.AnimationThe graphics give a dark and gloomy feel, which is cool. Blood and dismemberment look good and is better presented than in, for example, Elfen lied. The characters are not great, though. They look rather plain and ""normal"". Sure, this is an anime about normal people, but the dull characher design was one of the letdowns of this anime.Still, a high score for all the splatter and the dark theme.SoundNice intro/outro themes and background music. The voice acting is alright,...but there are waay too much ""eh, uh, ah"" moaning of people hesitating. Gets on my nerves.StoryWierd but interesting story of people being forced to play deadly games.

Gantz, is a diamond in the rough because of its surreal feel that provides a look at the darkest aspects of human behavior and the human mind, by letting you get to know the characters from the inside out. Characters think out loud in some sorta stream of consciousness, showing that which is normally left unheard. This keeps the phrase/cliché “show the evils of humanity through children” theme from being dull. In combination...with the uniqueness of the situation, the character's thoughts make Gantz an intriguing watch. A creative use of the human logic and  the raw look at the best and worst of humanity makes Gantz more than a gore-fest, but an OUTSTANDING series.Yeah i think they could have taken it farther since the Manga goes on Forever, but i think it was a great series altogether. Yes, sex in the anime, violence in the anime, doubtlessly made it attractive; one could even argue that the makers of the anime are making a statement based on how we are drawn in by our own nature, or apprehensive thoughts in this messed up society we all live today, where some human lives are worth less than others. In the end, there is nothing that cannot make Gantz both a great work of art and a great creative success because to me art is suppose to shock you, and this series did exactly that.This is why I believe Gantz is a perfect unique piece, regardless of how great the manga was.

I only made it a few episodes in before dropping this one. I really tried to give it a chance but after a while it was apparent that, yes, while the story was indeed moving in the forward direction, the pacing of the plot and the events on the screen would continue to bore me for the duration of the series.We start off with the most cliche\'d character as the main, 2 childhood best-friends, one sort of dim-witted, the other White Knight type who must always do good blah blah done to death a...million times. OK. I can get past that. The next round of characters, the shy guy with glasses, hotshot punk, obligatory helpless TnA chick, etc. just more 1-dimensional cardboard cutouts to occupy space on the screen before eventually serving as cannon fodder for the next bloody encounter.Then on to the ""action"". Well, if you count half a dozen people standing around staring at something in disbelief as ""action"". I\'m pretty sure they blew a whole 15 minutes of one episode standing there in front of that alien, and spent what seemed like an eternity trying to kill him.  Another episode seemed to spend its entire duration with the characters running through the street screaming and being chased. Didn\'t you people have guns or something? Have you tried pointing them and pushing the button? That usually seems to work. Instead we get stuck with 5-minute long internal monologues (typical boring anime trope) agonizing over personal failures, childhood nonsense and self doubt, all while there is supposed to be something exciting happening on the screen.I have never seen such a collection of uninteresting, frustratingly stupid people in one place at the same time. I found myself frequently shouting at the screen: ""Do something! Do anything!"" as most of the characters took turns standing still making that same *gasp* sound while watching each other get bludgeoned to death or eaten or whatever else. The violence and nudity in the show did not entertain me in the slightest. I love me some blood, guts and nudity as much as the next person, but I found most of the violence and sexuality in this show to be gratuitous and juvenile, hardly fitting for a show supposedly targeted to adults.How can a show about being brought back from the dead to shoot aliens be this incredibly boring? million times.

Katou is just a big pussy that you're gonna hate because of how useless he can be sometimes, and Kei Kishimoto is pretty much just an autistic version of Sakura from Naruto but with huge tits. Most of the side characters die just after getting introduced, the kill-count for this show is like Game of Thrones on crack, Don't get too attached to the characters because every single one has a high chance of getting killed at any moment, one character that i should mention is Nishi, he may not be the most original character ever but he was really interesting compared to most of the other side characters that were so bland that the writers, pretty much the only character that got any kind of development is Kurono Kei himself.Enjoyment : 8/10Even though this anime had its problems, the fun and enjoyment that you get while watching anime is never about storytelling or character development, it's just about the mindless action and intense fight scenes , you can watch this anime just for the excitement and action  if that's entertaining enough for you on it's own.Overall : 7/10Gantz was quite an enjoyable ride, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone that has any interest for the action genre, even though it's quite mediocre on a critical standpoint, i think it would be worth your time. However, what i think you should do right now is that you should go watch the anime, and right after you're done with it, go start the manga on chapter 90  (since that's where it goes right after the ending of the anime) , and that's where gantz gets really good and exciting. childhood friend Katou in the subway by chance after not seeing each other in a very long time, as the two were chatting, Katou notices a homeless man on the train tracks, but right after they help the man, they get hit by the subway train and get killed, now suddenly our two characters find themselves trapped in an apartment with some other people that had a near death experience be their last memory too, in the room there's also a big pitch-black sphere called Gantz, Kei and the others are now forced to fight aliens and gain points. now the set-up is very interesting and exciting, and it just makes you beg for more after every episode, but sadly this anime has one of the most anti-climatic endings I've seen, but it definitely had some exciting episodes that grabbed you by the balls, since everyone in this anime is constantly wearing a red shirt and it actually kept you on the edge of your seat at times ,but I'm very glad that the manga continues after that mediocre ending.Animation : 7/10Gantz was produced by Gonzo, the same studio that brought us Bokurano, Hellsing and Gankutsuou, but Gonzo is far from perfect, even though they can have some amazing and thrilling action scenes here and there, they are known for using very bad CGI that would stick out like Kurono on Viagra , most of the scenes looked solid with a small amount of flaws, so other than the CGI the rest of the visuals were acceptable, nothing that would drop the quality of the anime overall.Sound : 7/10The Japanese Dub was good, but the English Dub on the other hand was a little mediocre, with the emotions of the characters being misrepresented quite often, but watch the dub if you can overlook some shitty voice acting for irrelevant characters that are going to die in a few minutes anyway, the sound effects were pretty good, the soundtrack always matched the atmosphere of the scenes really well, and Christopher Ayres's Kurono Kei was surprisingly above average.Characters : 4/10Our main character Kei Kurono is a perverted teenager that comes off as a complete twat at first , but he does get a good amount of development throughout the second half of the series. Katou is just a big pussy that you're gonna hate because of how useless he can be sometimes, and Kei Kishimoto is pretty much just an autistic version of Sakura from Naruto but with huge tits.

Contains much nudity and a few heavily sexual scenes. Gantz is pretty bloody, probably won't find many that have as much or more gore than this. The characters grow on you so you'll probably like them. This one is meant more for the male population but has romance drama melted in very well. The animation is above standard as is the character design, looks to have CG mixed in. Not the best I've seen, I think the creators had a message but with this kind of action it gets kinda blurred. "", ""Story 9/10 - Innovative to say the least. I've never seen anything compare to the creativity put into Gantz. Without spoiling the plot twists, the story follows a young man who is killed, although finds himself in a strange room after death with a mysterious black ball. This black ball puts this young man, amongst others, into serious life threatening combat situations in which they are struggling to regain the life they had lost. Completely amazing.Art 10/10 - The blood is well done, the characters are well done, the visuals are amazing and the enemies are creative. Perfection.Character 9/10 - Nearly perfect.

And how!Story:The concept of Gantz is incredibly interesting and terrifying at the same time. The idea that people didn\'t really ""die"" until they\'ve defeated the Gantz was kind of reassuring, but once I saw the trials that the characters face in the series, I wasn\'t sure I wanted the extra chance was worth it... I tend to dwell on these things, so life after death-philosophies are best kept away from me...The story was pretty good, it was pretty intriguing, and like I said, an original way of viewing an ""afterlife"". In the end, it was what kept me watching...the series because every episode just seemed more terrifying than the last.

If you\'re not pulling out your hair while they try to decide whether to blink or not.', 'This review is written from the perspective of someone in middle of the series trying to finsh it off, and point out some confusion, pros and cons of the series as I see it. Many have voiced opinions as I will below, but first I want to take a moment and discuss the presentation of the series to a late-comer.The confusing part for me is trying to line up the TV series (the single disk I have) and the books, and which of the myrad of offerings Amazon has to offer will best fill the void.I can gauge the pace a little and...figure out at what point the stories line up, though I don\'t understand how the ""filler"" can be so different between the books and the TV versions.  I\'ve seen how stories have been reinterpreted before they are put to screen or print, and that stuff happens, but the Gantz TV series throws more of some things in that would have been more at home in the book (little things of no consequence to add into the book) but are almost out of place in the TV series.I was going to go into the Amazon mess that was confusing me, but it boils down to trying to find out how the ""collectors"" type collections match up to the first and second series. I guess I\'ll figure it out eventually.In case you are wondering, I usually buy random anime on clearance at the store hoping to find one that I like.  The first part of Gantz I found was disk 2 or 3, and it had little fighting, I don\'t remember even a single transfer to the room, but it was still intriguing, as it had some ""rememberances"" and the end had a few previews.  Wasn\'t bad but didn\'t make me want to tear up the town trying to find more.  I kept my eyes open, though.Book 1 showed up at Borders and I grabbed it. Art looked great on the cover, but I couldn\'t look through it til after I bought it, as it was wrapped, which also peaked my interest as it meant it wasn\'t going to be a simple ""children\'s story"".  I\'m on book 16 or 17 now, waiting for the horribly long and irratic period of time until the next release... while the untranslated series is 4x farther along and a movie has come out I\'m probably going to get to see anytime soon.  The anime is about all I can reach for....Now for my opinion on how I felt about the series.  I have mixed feelings.  As stated in other reviews the pacing is murderously slow and awkward, both in the TV version and in the books.  I keep feeling like I\'m straining for the next action/event to occur, at times nearly getting bored with the detail along the way......yet I was addicted when I opened the cover, and even more so when I replayed the lone disk I have after getting some of the beginning understood.  It isn\'t that I\'m particualarly attracted to the gore, the violence, the edginess, nudity, or some of the other things it\'s known for, but the series would fall flat on it\'s face without it all there, and in the books I notice that the author/artist seems to be at war with either himself or the publisher as he smears one issue with gatuitus gore and nudity, then seems to censor the next issue.  It\'s another frustration that it isn\'t consistant.The tech facinates me, though.  There are a few inconsistancies here and there, probibly due to errors in translation, but all in all the theory and mechanism of the technology of Gantz is far more fluid and coheasive than most anime/manga series for how far fetched it is.  Specific tools or devices have specific purposes, and there are no \'all powerful\' guns or abilities.  It almost seems like there is an imbalance at the beginning of the series, but this is due to the writer being able to keep the reader in the dark at the same pace as the main character, learning as he does.*Spoiler*I like stories that don\'t make concessions for ""main"" characters.  In some ways it was a slight letdown when Kei was basically killed off after doing little of nothing to solve the level, but he was the only one returned.  It would have been almost more at home to have the team survive and kei die, another ""main"" character replacing him, then kill the ""old team"" off.  I\'m not sure why Gantz would choose a player that it has had such trouble with and dissapointment over team mates that were much more ""live"" at the end and more active, even more successful.  Of course, that\'s part of the feel of the story: there\'s a craziness lurking in the shadows, wanting to be understood but refusing to come to light.*/spoiler*From what I\'ve read of the the TV series, it doesn\'t have an ending that lines up with the books, so it will be interesting to see how that plot develops.  The books eventually do make sense, even if it takes way more time than it needs to for the reasoning to come out.(A personal note:  There have been times that I\'ve considered not buying the next book, feeling like ""it\'s been two or three books this battle has been going on, when is something signifigant going to happen"".  Keep in mind that this is digests in graphic novel format, probibly about ten chapters to a book... I would probibly given up long ago if I had to buy EVERY SINGLE ISSUE of a Gantz comic, especially at today\'s US prices, or a whole magazines with single issues in them.  As many have mentioned, this is the biggest issue with the series.)All in all, I enjoy Gantz emensely, but wish that the author/artist (and carry this to the TV series) would stabilize his focus on steady and reasonable pacing, as well as pick a level of ""adult content"" and stick to it.  Varying levels of censorship are worse to me than continous levels of high censorship, as this latter does not distract from the actual story. figure out at what point the stories line up, though I don\'t understand how the ""filler"" can be so different between the books and the TV versions.

Varying levels of censorship are worse to me than continous levels of high censorship, as this latter does not distract from the actual story.', 'It’s a wonderful thing when a scene doesn’t have to rely on constant dialogue and allows other elements such as music or maybe even silence to combine with what’s happening on screen be it atmospheric or action based to deliver more powerful story telling than what words alone can do. If you have no idea what I was just talking about then you will probably like Gantz First Stage because all it is, is characters talking, shouting, talking or shouting across each other, screaming, crying, complaining, whining, you get the picture. To sum up the experience of watching this anime in one word it would...be ""headache"", because that’s mostly what I got out of this noise fest. The only reason I give it a 6 instead of a 4 or a 3 is because the parts outside of the terrible action scenes were done so well in my opinion that it brought the whole thing up somewhat. Let me break it down.Story – Just like with Afro Samurai (the first Anime I reviewed, this is the second) the plot makes no sense. From what I understand when a person dies in a specific area of Japan they are transported into a room with whoever else died that night or survived their last mission and they have to work together with the people in the room and destroy the aliens they are told to by this big black sphere called Gantz. They are given a powerful futuristic weapon and protection suit each and if the “subjects” let’s call these dead people that are brought back refuse to cooperate and make a run for it the government sends down a satellite beam that blows their heads off. Why the government need random people that happen to die to kill these aliens instead of handling it themselves with skilled men goes beyond me, especially considering all the aliens in this series are complete jokes.Of course it’s supposed to be a story about human nature, perhaps even an experiment. What happens when there become no rules, when a human is put in a situation where their animalistic nature can get the better of them and allow themselves to go nuts in their alien hunt mission? It’s a good idea but just not executed too well. Let me sum up how one of these alien encounters goes. Character points a gun at an alien. Character hesitates to pull the trigger but looks like they might be able to do it if they absolutely had to and feels they have to tell everybody about it. Another character tells them not too because it’s not right. Another character tells them to blow its head off. Those two characters get into an argument. The character holding the gun shouts that he doesn’t know what to do. Oh too bad the alien just killed 3 people. It gets old fast and if it wasn\'t bad enough they did this all the way through the first of the two Gantz missions this series making me think the lessons they\'d learnt would make them do better next time, they do the exact same thing again the second mission! It\'s extremely tiring, especially when the aliens are just about as loud and obnoxious as the characters, which we will get onto now.Characters – This is where some points can be redeemed. Kei Kurono is one of my favourite Anime characters (not in my top 10 but I still like him a lot). While he can be just as annoying as anybody else in the Gantz missions outside of the Gantz missions his progression is great. We really get to see inside his head and although many people wouldn’t want to admit it a lot of the time the things we see him contemplating are very realistic and things that we as real people might think about in these sorts of situations. Is he pathetic? Absolutely. But he\'s a pathetic kid who now has bragging rights. As he gets used to his suit and weapon he gets more cocky just as any human being would now that he has the technology to go beyond human limits. This and his personality in “other” situations make for some great moments that are really interesting, kick ass and also hilarious to watch. I don’t really want to spoil exactly what happens here. But if I sound like I know what I’m talking about so far then you can take my word for it.As for the other characters… well they’re all pretty darn annoying and never shut the hell up ever. Seriously I know I’m going on about that a lot but it really is a repeating problem. Masaru Kato. Good god! These aliens are trying to kill you and everyone around you. Stop trying to see the morality in EVERYTHING! Kei Kishimoto is your standard hot big boobed character, likable but not that interesting. Many people may not have liked Nishi for the simple reason he’s a massive dick but I liked him, he’s the only character who got anything done and could have got more done if he had the back up from his pathetic squad! Everyone else is an annoying forgettable side character.Art – Gantz has definitely jumped on the CG bandwagon which makes for some great shaping but not so good details in the art. Aside from that it doesn’t really jump out at you as a unique art style particularly with character designs unlike something like Code Geass or Monster for example. One thing I can say is that the Gantz manga is one of the most detailed I have ever seen. It might be worth checking it out.Animation – Terrible. Absolutely terrible. And it’s all because of the CG it tries to implement in order to try and create 3D environments and proximity between characters. It looks laughable to say the least and it is constantly distracting. Occasionally you might get a cool looking scene in an epic action shot but for the most part everything looks so dodgy, especially when the camera is moving, it’s like a load of 3D models put on the gamer grid.Action – Like I’ve already said, if there was less chit chat and dilly dallying around and more shooting some freaking aliens it could have redeemed some points here. Especially considering most of the aliens in this series could have been killed really easily. The animation does make the action look stupid and what the characters end up doing in order to win (see Masaru vs chicken robot) doesn’t help in its favour either. But if you like to watch characters shooting guns maybe you might get something out of this.Sound - Some of the sound effects are pretty cool being that they are using futuristic weapons but I can\'t say the soundtrack was particularly memorable but that probably means it can\'t have been that bad either. The opening is pretty catchy, after watching both First Stage and Second Stage it managed to stay in my head for weeks on end. In my case that was good as I liked it, but hopefully it doesn\'t get stuck in your head in a negative way. The English Dub I should point out is done very well. And that\'s not just because they use the mother of all swearwords (c**t) but the voice actors do great jobs too. Especially Chris Ayers as Kei Kurono.Enjoyment – As far as I’m concerned the Gantz missions were horrendously painful to watch and the parts outside the Gantz missions were absolutely fantastic. They are easily the more interesting parts as you see the characters lives unfold now that they’re doomed to do these missions and nothing else really matters anymore, especially to big boobs. I already mentioned Kei Kurono is awesome here but even Masaru who I hated was likable in his everyday life and I did manage to get invested in the side plot with his kid brother.Overall – I don’t recommend Gantz First Stage. But I recommend you watch Gantz First Stage so that you can watch Gantz Second Stage the better series. It might not stick to the manga in its ending but the missions were vastly superior and the everyday life was just as enjoyable as before. But I guess I have to say it\'s a decent series overall, if you\'ve seen much more anime than I have and missed this one out I\'d probably say check it out to add to your collection but if you\'re kind of starting out on the Anime road there are much better series out there I\'d say you should watch before getting onto this one. be ""headache"", because that’s mostly what I got out of this noise fest.

It\'s extremely tiring, especially when the aliens are just about as loud and obnoxious as the characters, which we will get onto now.Characters – This is where some points can be redeemed. Kei Kurono is one of my favourite Anime characters (not in my top 10 but I still like him a lot). While he can be just as annoying as anybody else in the Gantz missions outside of the Gantz missions his progression is great. We really get to see inside his head and although many people wouldn’t want to admit it a lot of the time the things we see him contemplating are very realistic and things that we as real people might think about in these sorts of situations. Is he pathetic? Absolutely. But he\'s a pathetic kid who now has bragging rights. As he gets used to his suit and weapon he gets more cocky just as any human being would now that he has the technology to go beyond human limits. This and his personality in “other” situations make for some great moments that are really interesting, kick ass and also hilarious to watch. I don’t really want to spoil exactly what happens here. But if I sound like I know what I’m talking about so far then you can take my word for it.As for the other characters… well they’re all pretty darn annoying and never shut the hell up ever. Seriously I know I’m going on about that a lot but it really is a repeating problem. Masaru Kato. Good god! These aliens are trying to kill you and everyone around you. Stop trying to see the morality in EVERYTHING! Kei Kishimoto is your standard hot big boobed character, likable but not that interesting. Many people may not have liked Nishi for the simple reason he’s a massive dick but I liked him, he’s the only character who got anything done and could have got more done if he had the back up from his pathetic squad! Everyone else is an annoying forgettable side character.Art – Gantz has definitely jumped on the CG bandwagon which makes for some great shaping but not so good details in the art. Aside from that it doesn’t really jump out at you as a unique art style particularly with character designs unlike something like Code Geass or Monster for example. One thing I can say is that the Gantz manga is one of the most detailed I have ever seen. It might be worth checking it out.Animation – Terrible. Absolutely terrible. And it’s all because of the CG it tries to implement in order to try and create 3D environments and proximity between characters. It looks laughable to say the least and it is constantly distracting. Occasionally you might get a cool looking scene in an epic action shot but for the most part everything looks so dodgy, especially when the camera is moving, it’s like a load of 3D models put on the gamer grid.Action – Like I’ve already said, if there was less chit chat and dilly dallying around and more shooting some freaking aliens it could have redeemed some points here. Especially considering most of the aliens in this series could have been killed really easily. The animation does make the action look stupid and what the characters end up doing in order to win (see Masaru vs chicken robot) doesn’t help in its favour either. But if you like to watch characters shooting guns maybe you might get something out of this.Sound - Some of the sound effects are pretty cool being that they are using futuristic weapons but I can\'t say the soundtrack was particularly memorable but that probably means it can\'t have been that bad either. The opening is pretty catchy, after watching both First Stage and Second Stage it managed to stay in my head for weeks on end. In my case that was good as I liked it, but hopefully it doesn\'t get stuck in your head in a negative way. The English Dub I should point out is done very well. And that\'s not just because they use the mother of all swearwords (c**t) but the voice actors do great jobs too. Especially Chris Ayers as Kei Kurono.Enjoyment – As far as I’m concerned the Gantz missions were horrendously painful to watch and the parts outside the Gantz missions were absolutely fantastic. They are easily the more interesting parts as you see the characters lives unfold now that they’re doomed to do these missions and nothing else really matters anymore, especially to big boobs. I already mentioned Kei Kurono is awesome here but even Masaru who I hated was likable in his everyday life and I did manage to get invested in the side plot with his kid brother.Overall – I don’t recommend Gantz First Stage. But I recommend you watch Gantz First Stage so that you can watch Gantz Second Stage the better series. It might not stick to the manga in its ending but the missions were vastly superior and the everyday life was just as enjoyable as before. But I guess I have to say it\'s a decent series overall, if you\'ve seen much more anime than I have and missed this one out I\'d probably say check it out to add to your collection but if you\'re kind of starting out on the Anime road there are much better series out there I\'d say you should watch before getting onto this one.', 'Okay, where to start... It seems to me that Gantz is underrated by the general anime community due to the gore in the series, yet if you can move past that I believe that there is a profound element that shines through in this series... namely a bold take on the meaning of life. It seems that the critics of Gantz are unable to appreciate the amplification of the qualities that make us human behind the violence that is prevalent throughout the series.If you are torn asunder between watching this series or not, be bold and watch it, despite the reviews created by people...who are afraid of the possibility of non-absolutism (in the traditional sense) of life and are henceforth unable to even pose the question of a Gantz-like scenerio. Aha! This is precicesly the point of this show, you will feel strong emotions while watching it, but as any free person, attempt to at least consider the show\'s perspective and you may learn something valuable about existence in general.The cruelty that humans are capable of imposing upon fellow humans is appalling, yet Gantz just brushes upon, with great brevity, some of the atrocities humans commit against one another. If you cant accept this simple fact you are too weak to appreciate this series.Character development in the show is especially impressive, as the protagonist changes when faced with dire circumstances. He MUST become the hero and BE the person with no fear to help the humans around him to survive.Please excuse the disorganization of this review but consider this when thinking of Gantz: this series epitomizes the beauty of life by forcing people to break their daily habit of living, (going to work, eating, passing away) and deciding what makes going through the pain of breaking their routine to accomplish something worth it. Essentially posing the question.. Why is going through the pain and horrors of life worth it if their is no after-life (in this scenario)? And then giving answers in an ambiguous way that many fear for most people don\'t want to hear it (need absolutism) but... I interpret this series to say that life is not a question to be solved but a mystery to be lived.Sorry about the grammer throughout, and not trying to shatter any beliefs here but a test of a strong mind is the ability to consider possible perspectives and their implications.. to watch this series you need to assume that there is no morality other than that which is created by the herd instinct of society. Additionally that no ""higher"" justice will befall wrongdoers.Hope you learn something from this animation! who are afraid of the possibility of non-absolutism (in the traditional sense) of life and are henceforth unable to even pose the question of a Gantz-like scenerio.

He is the side of all of us, controlled only by lust and greed, while all the other characters are literally plot devices to make Kei...do stupid shit.Not only does GANTZ go deep into the understanding of humanity, thus expressed with the almost lifelike animation quality! Let me break it down for you brotendo, but most anime reaches about 30 frames per second, though GANTZ reaches some points that I myself clocked out in a video editor at about 5fps. The fact that such primal and raw emotion can be shown in five frames is reason enough why you should watch this absolute masterpiece.Don't listen to any of these other virgin losers, GANTZ is an anime only for those of higher intelligence, if you don't like it, you simply do not get it. There is no possible way to dislike GANTZ.

In the first episode, the mc dies along with other characters and has to kill some aliens to go back to his life. Sounds weird? Probably. But it's epic. Another thing is the music and art. The opening, the ending and the music put in some scenes are really great and suit the anime perfectly. The art style is a little...bit weird but in my opinion is very good and graphic. Very gory tooThe bad about it:One thing Gantz fails in my opinion, is the characters. There are some awesome characters (like the MC -although a lot of people hate him, well I love him xD) but others are just not interesting and you really don't care much if they live or die.____If you like gore anime with good story, good action scenes and with a good pace then Gantz is definitely for you.

It's not just little bits, it's pretty in your face stuff.

It is hilarious, suspenseful, and all-and-all awesome.The gore and vulgar language are over the top, as well as the plot, but it was just so much fun to watch.While the show is riddled with flaws (that I don't need to illustrate if you've seen this), and is far from a masterpiece, it will always be my #1 anime in my heart. "", 'I have not seen a show like this in a long while. That\'s not to say it\'s good, mind you. I came away from [i]Gantz[/i] with mixed feelings that ultimately ended in dislike. The show follows a perverted, angry-at-the-world teenager who sees an old friend at a train station. They both witness a homeless man fall onto the tracks, and the friend jumps onto the tracks to save him, then yelling for his friend to help. For no good reason that I can figure out (unless it\'s peer-pressure), the cynic jumps onto the track to help. They save the old man, but are killed by...a train, and transported to an apartment, where others who have just died seem to be gathered.I don\'t want to say more about the plot, but I do like the ideas behind it. The story told in [i]Gantz[/i] is interesting enough that it kept me watching it all the way through. I wanted to know what was going to happen next, especially in the latter four episodes or so. However, the ending left me very unsatisfied, and made no sense at all. I came away from the story ultimately with a sense of pointlessness.Of course, it doesn\'t help the show\'s case that the main character is utterly unlikeable, for me at least. He almost comes off as believable, but is taken too far to really be a believable character.The same rings true for most of the characters. They\'re presented as these people in this alternate Earth, but then taken just a little too far in their archetypes to be believable. This isn\'t necessarily a problem for most of the characters, except the one or two that just become annoying.This problem is compounded by the art design for [i]Gantz[/i]. Everything is drawn quasi-realistically, but retains enough of the fact that it\'s an anime that, again, it just becomes a little annoying, rather than giving the impression that I\'m sure the people behind this show wanted it to.Voice acting for the series is, overall, decent. My only real problem with the voices was casting for certain characters, especially a major character, who ended up sounding weird at times. The VA work wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t great, either.My biggest problem with the show has to be the pacing. For the first few episodes, things go along somewhat slowly, but any time it comes to a scene where the characters disagree about something, they stand around for twenty minutes talking in circles about it. Everything seems like it\'s taking way too long, to the point where it became a game to guess what would happen episodes in advance, which isn\'t a fun game, because the answer is always, ""They\'re gonna talk about it for two episodes, and then they\'ll actually do [spoiler].""But not only does it move really slowly, but any time stuff does start to happen, the viewer is constantly assaulted by the gory deaths of characters that I guess we\'re supposed to care about, but I didn\'t, and by scenes that almost make this show hentai, if not for the rest of the plot.That\'s pretty much [i]Gantz[/i] in a nutshell; nothing happens, then gore, then sexual scene, then nothing for a while, then a lot of talking in circles, more gore, and more nothing.

To...break it down and make it simple A average high school student is taking the train home one day when he sees a homeless man fall onto the tracks, One of his friends he knew from when he was younger jumps down to help him seeing how nobody else was, His old friend looks and asks for help seeing him calls him out to help.  Of course he doesn't want to die but he doesn't want to look like a jerk either so rushes down to help after helping the homeless man off the tracks the two boys realize they can't get back up as the train is to close they both start running hoping the train will stop before it hits.  To no avail the train ends up not stopping at this station and keeps going the two boys are struck and instantly die.  Or so they think they wake up in a room filled with other people alive and well, Nobody knows how or why but they were all alive after being dead or so they thought the room has windows and doors none of which open the only thing in the room is a large black sphere.  It tells them there lives are now over and that what happens to there new lives is up to it to decide.  Now that is probably the simplest way to put it and the premise alone had me hooked.  I have never done a review before so please excuses me if this one is a bit sloppy or not well done I will try better in the future, But if you like great story pretty great characters Sci Fi type premises and awesome action I think you will really enjoy this anime.  Side note this is a mature themed anime there is nudity lots of gore and violence and swearing. break it down and make it simple A average high school student is taking the train home one day when he sees a homeless man fall onto the tracks, One of his friends he knew from when he was younger jumps down to help him seeing how nobody else was, His old friend looks and asks for help seeing him calls him out to help.  Of course he doesn't want to die but he doesn't want to look like a jerk either so rushes down to help after helping the homeless man off the tracks the two boys realize they can't get back up as the train is to close they both start running hoping the train will stop before it hits.

Side note this is a mature themed anime there is nudity lots of gore and violence and swearing."", 'Beforehand I want to say, Gantz is my absolute favourite Manga, but the Anime is certainly not.Story:Gantz has a really interesting story, the first episode of Gantz is likely the most interesting thing you will see in the whole Anime.A everyday guy goes his usual way while you as viewer can listen to all of the peoples thoughts of what they are currently thinking. This is certainly something you will not find in any other anime, definitely worth the watch because it\'s such a different experience and very interesting from a psychological point of view.What happens then is, the main character gets hit by a...train(in it\'s actual meaning) and wakes up in a room with other people who seem to have died and the weird black ball called ""Gantz"" sends all of them on missions for their survival to fight aliens which inhabit earth. The whole idea seems like a very morbide, crotesque way of looking at what might happen after death or a weird way of a sci-fi story to tell a very disturbing, scary tale.From there on however, the story gets dull. The ""dead"" people keep getting sent on their missions of survival, fighting off aliens while fanservice scenes keep showing up and while the anime similarly like the manga tries to show the cruelty of humanity and some really deep philosophical meanings and tries to make you think, the anime version of Gantz sadly fails at this miserably and even the ending makes you want not to ever have watched the anime because it won\'t make any sense and you get the feeling something is missing.You get the feeling you are in a anime that was made for little boys in their puberty. Nudescenes everywhere, videogame-style missions and 3D-monsters which seem totally unfitting in the anime background and act like a bot out of a game.It\'s like the author thought ""let\'s make a anime which offers action, sex and all covered within a videogame sheme to make it look cool for young boys"".Art & Sound:Gantz offers standard animations and drawings, nothing too interesting but also nothing that would disappoint overly. most of the Monsters which show up in almost every episode of Gantz are not drawn but are 3D Models and don\'t seem to have any sort of movement animation and instead just ""float"" without any sort of movement, really dull, from one point to another.The drawing style itself reminds of typical Hentai drawings, which makes the anime seem even more like a mindless trash-story.The sounds are alright, very nice Intro and Ending songs, the background music is not exaggerated and resembles the current mood well, the soundeffects however don\'t always fit in.Characters:Kurono, the main character is the perfect main character for a story in my opinion. He is just everything that is real. He is no superman who does what he wants and beats everyone and he also isn\'t a idiot, who just searches for fights and is not able to count to 3.He is your typical guy that you could identify yourself with. He seems educated, slightly arrogant, perverted and overall just everything that identifies what a human is. Unpure, with his mistakes and yet looking out for the best he can be. However, he doesn\'t develop throughout the story much, unlike in the manga. So he stays the egoistic human he is from beginning till the end. He does have some sort of change of minds within the story nevertheless.Then there are the Sub-Main characters like Kato, who seems to represent the good side of what a human should be. And while the anime doesn\'t offer much in comparison to the manga, it shows with Kato at least something important of a character for a story. Somebody who looks at Kato might think ""oh he\'s a good guy. He has his heart at the right place"" while someone else might think ""man is that guy an idiot"". And this is where this character makes you start to think. If you think being the good guy is good, looking at this guys actions might make you reconsider, while his noble actions might also touch you if you are the person to say ""what he does is just dumb"".The female main characters are not really of any importance in this anime. They seem more like a bunch of puppets without real personalities.Most of the time they are busy giving fan-service and if they are not, they need to be rescued by the main chars of the story.There are also tons of different characters which keep coming and dying throughout the story and these characters are all made exceptionally brilliant.They act mostly dumb, egoistic or just very cliche-like in such a critically exaggerated way that you just have to dislike most of them and are glad they are dead once they die.They show perfectly just how humans in general are, what their priorities are in a dire situation and how their daily life makes them ignorant, not even trying to see something extraordinary like aliens a possibility.Gantz as anime offers overall not much except for some fan-service and action in videogame-style. The ending is not even the real ending of the actual story, but just a filler ending which makes you more confused than that it explains anything.As Gantz fan I will still honestly admit that this anime will most likely disappoint you and be nice at most.The concept of life and death, the crotesque and rude way of showing humans and the brave choice of showing balantly gore and nudescenes sure makes you want more and is a very good fundamental idea, which was just not executed correctly.If you find the idea of Gantz from the first episode on onward is totally uninteresting, then this anime is not worth watching on in any way, it won\'t get anymore interesting than it was before.If you find the first episode or at least the fundamental idea of Gantz interesting, you may watch the whole series, it\'s not completely bad but might disappoint you from your expectations.I can strongly suggest in this case however to read the Manga of Gantz, because it executes the fundamental idea of this really well, which the anime just does not.~Flevalt train(in it\'s actual meaning) and wakes up in a room with other people who seem to have died and the weird black ball called ""Gantz"" sends all of them on missions for their survival to fight aliens which inhabit earth.

It showers the show in so much  gore, profanity, nudity yet it is still awesome. I\'m not the biggest fan of action anime. I mostly dislike the genre but this show got my attention from episode 1.A pair of high school students, Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, are hit by a subway train, after saving the life of a homeless drunk who had fallen onto the tracks. Following their deaths, Kurono and Kato find themselves transported —alive and well— along with a number of people who have...also just died, to the interior of a Tokyo condominium. They are unable to leave, as the outside door and all the windows can not be opened, and cell phones do not work. At one end of the room is a featureless black sphere known as ""Gantz"".I found the story of gantz to be very interesting but nothing too awesome.  But I did not mind this small hiccup for the plot is not the main part I enjoyed this anime. The main part I enjoyed was the the amazing art, the fantastic sound, and the amazing characters. Sure some of the characters weren\'t that memorable but the ones that were, were just great. One of the most memorable characters from this season was definitely Joichiro Nishi. He is from them from day one, and is the only one out of them that has any experience with the matter.The music wasn\'t that memorable except for the opening theme song ""Super shooter"". But sound isn\'t just music. The sounds were up to par with the animation, and art style and just made it so much better.All of these categories combined together definitely made this a fantastic anime and one of my favourites I\'ve ever seen.  I recommend you should atleast try this anime to see if you like it before passing it up. As I said before It\'s either love or hate so just stick with it for a couple episodes and see how you like it. also just died, to the interior of a Tokyo condominium.

He suggested this manga to me because I said I enjoyed Death Note and Code Geass the most. I told him I wanted something intense and intriguing. Something that makes you think.I ended up not buying it. However, when I saw the anime on sale at rightstuf, I decided to check it out.I bought the first 4 episodes, and then ended up buying the entire series(both seasons) right after finishing those four.Honestly, there\'s not really an anime I can compare it to... If I had to, I would say...it\'s most like Deadman Wonderland, because they both never really pull any punches. I like that. I think, this show has a lot of character; you even learn to love characters that you initially hated in the beginning. It really makes you realize that even horrible people...are still people. And if you take the story to heart and not superficially(with its ugly, harsh exterior), it really is touching.In the beginning, I hated the characters. But despite all their weaknesses(and every character had pretty big issues), this show made me feel for them as well...So...I guess, I didn\'t really hate them after all. They were just....so human, that I found it hard to, in the end.The reason this story is so good is because it doesn\'t bullshit around. And it shows clearly what different kinds of people would do in life or death situations. I really enjoyed seeing how the characters reacted. I found their reactions very realistic. Being in a life or death situation, most people would react cowardly. And in this show, they very often do. There\'s nothing pretty about it, and there\'s nothing heroic or cool about some of the characters. But that\'s life. And that\'s what makes this anime so real.The only con for me was that I felt the scenes where the characters struggled between killing or not killing(then perhaps losing their own lives or the lives of others), were heavily dragged out.... Then again, I could see myself reacting in a similar way....The best part about this anime was that it doesn\'t tell you how to think. It doesn\'t give you any bias\' on the characters. It\'s just shows all their flaws, and lets you decide.I also liked seeing the main character grow and change through his experiences. Seeing how the main characters friendship with the other two main characters and other characters later on shapes his own was really cool. He started out as a prick...and he\'s always a bit of a prick, even til the end...but as the show goes on...you start to respect and care about him...prick or not.I guess the way you will like this anime, is if you can relate to the characters. If you can understand what it would be like to feel their terror, anger, and pain despite some of their stupid actions. And if you can... Then, I promise you. You will be blown away by this anime. You will be moved and touched. And you will love all the main characters and root for them to succeed.That said, this isn\'t meant for people who enjoy mostly light-hearted animes or even animes that avoid dark issues. Unless you really love dark tragic shows that confront every uncomfortable situation or disturbing moments like this one does... I wouldn\'t suggest it. It contains a ton of blood, gore, nudity and sex. There are many disturbing scenes, meant to shock you, and make you think ""what would I do""? So unless you can relate to the dread and horror of the situations and feel it for yourself, it may just come off as disturbing and depressing.But... if you like entertainment that is moving, alarming, and honest, and that leaves a strong impression, while giving no bias toward what\'s right and what\'s wrong, and you don\'t mind some harsh language and a whole lotta blood... You will love this. :) it\'s most like Deadman Wonderland, because they both never really pull any punches. I like that.

I stopped right at the end because this anime was still so damn SLOW. But let\'s speak about the different aspects of the animation serie.Story 7/10Why 7? Because the concept was kind of creative. This kind of killing mission where only people who just died are used to kill aliens is not so bad. But the problem is not here.Art 4/10This anime is quite old allready. 2004, so the artstyle became old. The details are not really present and the colors are kind of poor. The characters are not really...beautiful to look at, but I would say that this aspect goes well with the plot, which has to be a bit psychological and/or stressed. Having bad looking people make the anime less ""ideal"" and give a bit more of realism.Sound 5/10I saw this series in streaming, so on an extremely legal way. The sound was there... but I didn\'t noticed a special theme that was putting emphasis on the situation or the atmosphere. The sound was there... it wasn\'t perfect, but not awful either.Character 6/10The characters are HUMANS and we can FEEL it when we see the serie BUT the way they interact with each other is REALLY BAD. I think the show wanted to create a ""bad society atmosphere"". But this anime puts it a bit TOO FAR. People are not so DUMP and BAD. Our society is not nice, but the people, ALL the people would lend a hand if the danger was not going right towards them.[SPOILER]For example at the beginning, the two main characters are killed by a FU**ING TRAIN. HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY ACCEPT THAT!!!!! This is a REALLLLLLLYYYYY BAD choice of the autor. Why? Because they tryed to get away from the rails by running down the station. And NOBODY COULD HELP THEM GETTING BACK ON THE SIDE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!![SPOILER]The whole problem in this anime is the way the people interact with each other and the way it is shown. Everyone become USELESS in this anime. Everyone stay where he stands and wait for the others to DIE. I thought this was a good choice at the beginning to show how the anime works and than get rid of this way of doing and get a bit of dynamic in the action scenes. BUT NO. From the beginning to the end EVERYONE has a gun and 80% of the people get killed because the others are watching them die, without trying to help. They only shoot when 60% of the group is dead.Normally, when ONE human is killed. The person/entity who did it is maybe the target of the group, when EVERYONE HAS A GUN. But no, 70% has to die in a REALLY dump way to understand that THIS IS A THREAT which CAN KILL EVERYONE.If this show wasn\'t so dump, I would maybe have enjoyed it.So,Enjoyment 3/10No I didn\'t enjoy this.........Overall 5/10To end this review, I would say that you CAN\'T LIKE THIS only because of the way the anime was realised. The way the action is less then slow and all the characters are perverted humans with snails in the head instead of a brain. The main concept was interresting.... but it was a bad way to show it, to use it. Every single thing could have been better.But the show is old. So some of this mistakes are due to a lack of technology and experience. beautiful to look at, but I would say that this aspect goes well with the plot, which has to be a bit psychological and/or stressed. Having bad looking people make the anime less ""ideal"" and give a bit more of realism.Sound 5/10I saw this series in streaming, so on an extremely legal way. The sound was there... but I didn\'t noticed a special theme that was putting emphasis on the situation or the atmosphere. The sound was there... it wasn\'t perfect, but not awful either.Character 6/10The characters are HUMANS and we can FEEL it when we see the serie BUT the way they interact with each other is REALLY BAD. I think the show wanted to create a ""bad society atmosphere"". But this anime puts it a bit TOO FAR. People are not so DUMP and BAD. Our society is not nice, but the people, ALL the people would lend a hand if the danger was not going right towards them.[SPOILER]For example at the beginning, the two main characters are killed by a FU**ING TRAIN. HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY ACCEPT THAT!!!!! This is a REALLLLLLLYYYYY BAD choice of the autor. Why? Because they tryed to get away from the rails by running down the station. And NOBODY COULD HELP THEM GETTING BACK ON THE SIDE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!![SPOILER]The whole problem in this anime is the way the people interact with each other and the way it is shown. Everyone become USELESS in this anime. Everyone stay where he stands and wait for the others to DIE. I thought this was a good choice at the beginning to show how the anime works and than get rid of this way of doing and get a bit of dynamic in the action scenes. BUT NO. From the beginning to the end EVERYONE has a gun and 80% of the people get killed because the others are watching them die, without trying to help. They only shoot when 60% of the group is dead.Normally, when ONE human is killed. The person/entity who did it is maybe the target of the group, when EVERYONE HAS A GUN. But no, 70% has to die in a REALLY dump way to understand that THIS IS A THREAT which CAN KILL EVERYONE.If this show wasn\'t so dump, I would maybe have enjoyed it.So,Enjoyment 3/10No I didn\'t enjoy this.........Overall 5/10To end this review, I would say that you CAN\'T LIKE THIS only because of the way the anime was realised. The way the action is less then slow and all the characters are perverted humans with snails in the head instead of a brain. The main concept was interresting.... but it was a bad way to show it, to use it. Every single thing could have been better.But the show is old. So some of this mistakes are due to a lack of technology and experience.', ""Gantz - A story of people being randomly abducted and commanded by a ball to kill aliens, with a fair share of gore along the way. I have heard of anime with a worse premise that have actually turned out to be really good, but Gantz wasn't actually one of them.Story (4)~ MAYBE all of my complaints will be resolved with season two but for now I will say that a lot is just thrown into the anime and not explained. A lot of conflict, mysterious overlord black ball guy, aliens..... And this isn't even a spoiler that none of it is explained, not...even a hint as to why ANYTHING in the anime is happening is dropped. I would just explain the story as guys killing aliens, which is probably pretty bad seeing as I'm someone who can make PacMan sound meaningful. I think that you should at least drop a tease to some answers in your first season (I really think SOMETHING should be answered mostly anyway) but towards the end all Gantz gave was people questioning what they had been all along, but just sounding more angry about it.Art (6)~ Meh. The art is just meh. The characters are completely meh as well as the scenery and even the gore. The only thing that I can really comment on here is the art of the aliens. They are disgusting. I personally liked this element, even though it was immediately putting a bias on them (if something didn't look as absolutely ugly I would question why it deserved to be killed). I think it added nicely to the whole affect and mood and it does make you revolted by the enemy presented to you, which seeing as the story and characters give you no motivation to hate them I guess the artists had to make them ugly.Sound (5)~ I like the opening song I guess but the rest of the soundtrack to me was white nose. I don't feel like it adds too much to any type of mood so it wasn't really notable to me.Character (6)~ This is the saving grace of the whole anime for me, I really enjoyed the backstories of the characters. I didn't like any of the characters though if that makes any sense. Even those I sympathised with annoyed me whenever they opened their mouths and no one really has any notable or redeeming qualities. I just really enjoyed what they were going through in life, especially the characters that later come in to the anime.Enjoyment (4) ~ As I said before, there isn't much really to draw you into the story, make you like the characters or just put you on edge in general. I was only really watching for as long as I did because I wanted to find out more about the characters backstories. Even the gore didn't pull me back into paying attention. Well maybe episode 11 had the most of my attention but even now Ouran High School Host Club was more nail biting than this.Overall (6) ~ I really think I'm being generous here. Gantz is an anime that I would never ask someone if they've watched or tell them to watch because I don't care and I don't feel like it has anything that needs to be seen except for confusion, but not even a good kind of confusion like Cat Soup or Perfect Blue. Personally I wouldn't waste time on it as it doesn't really offer much and is really draw out with the last four episodes.

Most of the backlash stems from its seemingly dull, sometimes annoying characters and their actions e.g. their hesitation to ""pull the trigger"" when the situation is dire. Or possibly even the slow-burn plot progression and the multiple episodes of nothing but character development sans fight sequences. I however saw all of these things as near perfect. Gantz follows the story of average, run of the mill human beings drawn into a war with the things that hide in the...dark with no training and lacking the constitution for it. Most of the hesitation from the characters can be explained away at this notion, even if the dialog and actions from them are over-exaggerated and seem unlikely. You must remember that these people are just people, not bad mofo fighting machines portrayed in other anime. This is primarily where my affection for this show stems, as it tried pretty hard to steep the characters in real human defects of character, even if it\'s way over-embellished. And yes, this show is brutal af, but who doesn\'t like some great gore every once in awhile? Honestly I\'d suggest this show to anyone, but it\'s not my job to make the world love this little gem as much as I do, that\'s for you to decide. dark with no training and lacking the constitution for it.

""Highschool DXD has too much fanservice"". ""Highschool Of The Dead has too much -"" Calm down people! Gantz is here and oh boy it uses shock value and fanservice worse than most Seinen and Ecchi media. Gantz is known in the beginning as being infamous for terrible characters, poor, shoehorned and unneeded usages of shock value and fanservice, pacing and story. Let\'s get to the details.Story: The story is about a young man named Kei Kurono who is pathetically perverted and very well weak. After school he does some outside activities and meets with his friend Katou. They...head to the train station in which they find a homeless man and after saving him they just wait for the train to run them over because they weren\'t fast enough *facepalms*. They get partially resurrected by a mysterious ball like being known as Gantz which they must survive in a death game and kill all the aliens as possible. A very interesting premise but the story loses its identity by focusing on other random stuff for no reason other to say ""Some humans are bad. Life is tough"" and has many plot holes and inconstancies. The anime adaptation is worse as it uses a terrible original ending that has no relation to the manga at all.Characters: Most of the characters are awful. Many of the males are cliched, over- arrogant for the sake of ""Human can be bad at times"", perverted, narcissistic and idiotic while the females are damsels in distresses, almost only exist to be sexually objectified (Yes actually they are) and used for death fodder and sex. While Kishimoto gets development. It\'s very short as they kill her off fast after giving her ""development"" which is absolutely pointless and stupid.Sound: Most of the music is trash and misplaced. Example is when they\'re fighting the father Green Onion Alien. It sounds like superhero music is being played rather than fitting music that\'s supposed to sound more intense. The suspense/unsettling music sounds like it was ripped off of classic horror films like Halloween though the opening is cheesy fun while the ending theme is good. The Japanese voices are good but the dub is garbage. The dub tries to poorly emulate most of Manga Entertainment\'s profanity filled cheesy dubs and the characters sound more annoying in the dub such as Kishimoto\'s screaming and Kei\'s whiny voice though usual for ADV to have poor dubbing choices.Overall: It\'s quite pretty bad at times and I hope the manga is better too. The fanservice is actually sexist to the point it makes Dead Or Alive, Highschool DXD, Highschool Of The Dead and even Fairy Tail look clean in comparison. Gantz is a mess and it seems it wants to destroy its great ideas and potential at times. head to the train station in which they find a homeless man and after saving him they just wait for the train to run them over because they weren\'t fast enough *facepalms*.

I was hyped to see a oversexualized and gory anime. Then I watched it and remember being underwhelmed by it.Recently, I gave it a rewatch and now I am not only doubly underwhelmed but also can see the clear reasons behind my initial hype and disappointment afterwards.First of all the pacing is fucked as hell. It is stretched like a fuckn cheesy slice of pizza that never lets go. My initial bad view of this show clearly stems from that reason. It seems like it is targeted for brain damaged people that...has cognitive problems. It is so much repetitive for no clear reason other than to fill the animation time without much effort.Sex sells. That much is clear so I cannot say I am saddened by the amount of titties, thighs and sexual intercourses in the anime. But, alone they could not save the show. This is not a hentai after all. Were it a hentai with more gore, it might have been at least decent I guess. But sadly this is not the case.Action is also on the level of non-action.

Whereas most other sub par anime in this genre use flashy or elaborate action sequences to cover up a tacky and cliché plot, Gantz does this opposite. The plot is fine, the tone is fine, the characters (at least before they were screwed up) are fine but Gantz loses the majority of its points for criminally awful action sequences.I tried to think about what makes Gantz’ action so uniquely bad and I came up with this:1)\tTerrible Directing. The fight sequences are boring, drawn out and lazy. There is never more than one thing going on at a time. There is no respect for pacing or continuity. Monsters will literally stand still in the background, as the humans bicker among themselves.2)\tAnnoying Empathy: One of the pivotal decisions any character in any death game anime has to make is whether he/she is capable of killing in order to survive. This internal struggle and the character’s ultimate decision can take many forms but it’s fascinating to watch. Think Phantom, Fate/Zero, Alice in Borderlands. The way Gantz handles this dilemma is just immature. The choice should be so simple, either you kill the alien who just slaughtered half of your party or you die yourself. I won’t go into specifics but the characters have a serious problem getting into a survival mentality. Even ‘veteran’ characters constantly waver back and forth between whether or not it’s right to fight to survive. This does not add complexity or nuance it simply makes the whole cast impotent and ineffectual.3)\tLack of urgency: It’s no wonder Kato, Kishimoto and Kurono have time to navel-gaze and ponder moral quagmires because even in in supposed ‘life and death situations,’ urgency is in short supply. You’ll literally have groups of characters idly standing around, gawking as trusted friends get murdered. Should we do something? Should we not? <brutal death> Hmm that was awful but I’m still not ready to act so let’s talk about this some more. <another death> Well we have to do something but let’s first give that wounded enemy some time to recover. <another death> . etc. etc. etc.The overall theme of this anime is unbelievable incompetence. Everyone sucks at what they are doing. Everyone. In juxtaposition to an anime like JoJo where suspense/action are built up by showing the protagonist/antagonist cleverly one-upping each other, the story of Gantz is only driven forward because the good guys and the bad guys can’t stop fucking up so much. Poor aim, missed opportunities, STANDING AROUND, sudden pangs of indecision/empathy are constant roadblocks to actually enjoying the intriguing premise of the anime. When you add mediocre animation to the mix it’s like watching a death match between two retarded, paraplegic and blind gladiators.

You’ll literally have groups of characters idly standing around, gawking as trusted friends get murdered. Should we do something? Should we not? <brutal death> Hmm that was awful but I’m still not ready to act so let’s talk about this some more. <another death> Well we have to do something but let’s first give that wounded enemy some time to recover. <another death> . etc. etc. etc.The overall theme of this anime is unbelievable incompetence. Everyone sucks at what they are doing. Everyone. In juxtaposition to an anime like JoJo where suspense/action are built up by showing the protagonist/antagonist cleverly one-upping each other, the story of Gantz is only driven forward because the good guys and the bad guys can’t stop fucking up so much. Poor aim, missed opportunities, STANDING AROUND, sudden pangs of indecision/empathy are constant roadblocks to actually enjoying the intriguing premise of the anime. When you add mediocre animation to the mix it’s like watching a death match between two retarded, paraplegic and blind gladiators. Good Luck.', '1st review ever so tips and opinions are welcomed here with opened arms.Remember that guy that used to talk crap about you for watching anime? I was that guy. I never understood how people could be so into cartoons.  Then, 3 years ago my friend sat me down and forced to me to watch Gantz. And Gantz is certainly not a cartoon.Story 8/10: Gantz is about a group of individuals, ranging from kids to senior citizens, that have died and somehow are transferred to a room before being thrown in to battle in a game to hunt various alien lifeforms. The thing is this...is your 2nd chance to live and if you die, you\'re dead this time.I really enjoyed the story. It drew me in and had my attention all the way through. Just wondering,""How can their situation get any worse?"" Then it did. Now don\'t get me wrong, its no Steins;Gate. Now when i say that i mean in terms of the story progressing over time so you get to really understand its plot line. Gantz just sorta says, ""This is what you\'re getting so deal with it."" I admire that. It doesn\'t try to be something else. It doesn\'t need to be. The concept was new and fresh for its time, and i haven\'t seen anything like it since.Art 9/10: The art was amazing, especially considering that it was released in 2004. I love the guns that they use. They are so different than anything before it. There is plenty of gore in this anime and the animated mutilations were incredible. I haven\'t seen such a style of animation done quite like this to this day.Sound 7/10: I can\'t say anything great nor anything bad about the audio. I guess....it was just there. Nothing special about it really.Character 10/10: I really loved the characters in Gantz. They felt like real people. Think about it. A bunch of random people thrown in a room together after they died with no idea how they got there or what is going on. Each one of them has their own personality, their own beliefs and ideals, so its natural to react in different manners. Some people start cussing because they\'re nervous and freaking out. Believe me there is a lot of foul language, especially from the mouth of our protagonist Kei Kurono. Still, no 2 characters are the same. Just as no 2 people in this world are the same (except maybe twins). Through-out the series they stay true to who they are and that\'s what i love about these characters.Enjoyment+Overall 9/10: This series kept me entertained from start to finish, toying with the fact that everyone died once before so nobody is safe. The level of nudity and violence in Gantz is ridiculous and i mean RIDICULOUS. This is not for the weak at heart. If you can\'t bare to see melting flesh and torsos being ripped apart, then just walk away dude.

I\'ve seen the dub, sub and I\'m up to date with the manga of this series, so I\'ll be reviewing that too to give it a fair evaluation.Gantz is split up into two seasons of blood, gore and utterly mind blowing acts of sadistic grandeur that can be compared to other animé in the same seinen genre; you\'ll want to avoid this like the plague if you don\'t like your blood or gore but I would highly recommend this for the excellent action scenes. Well then, let\'s get into the thick of...things with Gantz.Story -Gantz has quite an interesting premise, taking a step into the horror survival genre while making it seem like a \'fun\' game to the audience, although I\'m sure that all of the characters would be prone to disagree. It poses a lot of strong sci-fi elements despite being set in modern day tokyo, so if you\'re into your weird guns and outfits, you\'re likely going to check this out.If I had to summarize the story in three words, they\'d be blood, sex and guns. It works as a short action series; the first season is very consistent because of its\' close relationship to the original source material, a reason for why this will score significantly higher for me than the second season.At the core, it\'s a very bleak and rather shallow story about surviving through twisted survival games in which the monsters look as if they\'ve been designed by a monkey on crack. Not even kidding, some of the characters look like aliens themselves.With all of that being said though, the story of the first series is consistent and gives us plenty of time to get to know our protagonists, sadly not enough time to really bond with them or see them evolve from being completely unlikable just because of how hormonal the lot of them are. Seriously, it\'s like all of the males have been stacking up on oestrogen and the females don\'t know how to keep their legs together.Art -I don\'t know what happened to the art for this show, the manga is actually rather well drawn but the series takes that and completely butchers it into an absolute mess. All of the characters look uninteresting, and the protagonist looks so bratty most of the time, it takes all of my restraint to not just leap in and slap him into oblivion. I suppose it\'s supposed to look realistic to some degree because of the series\' gritty nature, but to me it appears as if they\'ve only really gone half-way with that; the characters\' just aren\'t as expressive as they appear in the manga and they look really forced whenever they try to show something resembling an emotion. With all of that being said though, there is one thing in this series that\'s well drawn, and that\'s the female leads breasts. I\'m not even kidding, there\'s more detail in her boobs than in the rest of the cast combined. It\'s not a surprise, as attractive female characters fill out most of the blank pages in the manga too. It\'s basically saying, ""We hope you enjoyed your blood and gore, here, have some boobies~!"" Yeah. If you\'re not into that sort of thing, I\'d give this series a miss.Sound -After going through the entire sound-track, I can happily say that I think it\'s complete garbage and not something that I\'d like to listen to, but I do think it could have been used in a better place. Gantz is set in modern day Tokyo, it\'s not set on an alien planet, thus the sound-track comes off as a little misplaced. It\'s overly dramatic when characters die(Spoiler?), and when I say overly dramatic, I mean it feels as if the music is trying to make you care when you really don\'t because you haven\'t known the character long enough to even attempt caring. I\'m not going to count character death as a spoiler in this review, I won\'t name the characters but death in Gantz is about as common as breathing air. I think what they tried to do with the sound, is try and complement the alien theme that\'s given off by the series\' \'antagonist?\', which doesn\'t really have much of a personality outside of making horrible jokes about all of the other characters in written text form. (Which are hilarious, by the way.) Well, that would be fine, but the dramatic and slow paced music doesn\'t clash well with the high octane action scenes and it doesn\'t really work for characters we have had very little time to care for.Character -All of the characters in Gantz are perfectly regular people, with a few quirks and none of them are especially interesting; mediocre at best. Given time to grow more attached to them, perhaps you\'d like them a little more, but you\'d have to read the manga for that because most of the characters you\'ll be getting to know in this series will likely not be appearing in the next.Hey! Main protagonist, Light Yagami called and he wants his character design back! That\'s right, folks. Our protagonist looks like an alienated Light Yagami with none of his attractive features and a bratty \'woe is me\' streak that comes off as desperate plea for attention. There\'s absolutely nothing wrong with him, he has no physical or mental ailments and his personality ends ""I\'ve never gotten laid."" Dude, you\'re a teenager. You\'re not horrendously disfigured or suffer from a disorder. You\'re going to get laid, give it some time. I really hate characters(and people) like that.The supporting cast isn\'t much better either. If I had to summarize the three major characters in order of importance, I\'d go with; the horny puppy, the pacifist but not really and the stupid one, with big titties.Thankfully, there is one character in this series that insults them all on a daily basis so I don\'t have too and that\'s the somewhat antagonist, Gantz! I really do mean it, for a character that never speaks vocally, he sure knows how to rile up the cast with his horrible puns, dark humor and overall black persona that would make most forum trolls cringe if they got into the ring with him.Enjoyment -While this show suffers from massive bouts of mediocrity, there are some things that still make it a show good enough to make my \'seven\' list. It\'s quite funny; watching the characters you hate so much suffer(if you\'re into that) turns out to be a very enjoyable prospect because they all more or less get what they deserve for being the most boring, three dimensional people on the entire planet. Topped off with some strong, black humor and there we go, a pretty hilarious sci-fi, gore-filled comedy with titties, guns and more titties.Overall -It has an interesting premise, art tangible enough to let us know what\'s happening in the story, an unfitting sound track, bland yet realistic characters and enjoyable dark humor. I would not suggest this series to a young audience but if you enjoy the seinen genre, this isn\'t something that I\'d pass up on a night where I have nothing else to watch. Avoid the English Dub like a plague; not only do all of the characters sound one hundred percent more like angst possessed rejects, but they change the script and add a ton of American colloquialism and sex puns that don\'t belong in there at all.If you do enjoy this season, check out the second season; I\'ll be pulling up a review for it shortly. If you feel unsatisfied by the train wreck of a second season, read the manga because it really is worth the time to read if you\'re into this sort of thing.

I highly recommend it.', 'Most underrated anime ever. Gantz is about a guy who gets ran over by a train when he trys to help this bum off a railway, he ends up in this hotel room and ends up in a survival game, to win this game you have to get 100 points, when you get a 100 points, you can leave the game or get a new weapon and play the game over, this anime is very gory and is for 18+. sadly this is only a 26 epeisode series but the manga is still ongoing! ', ""Unlike Gantz:2nd stage what i also reviewed the way it ended SUCKED!, i like the 1st season FAR better , the gruesomeness of it all, the hopelessness of the ppl, keeping control at any costs, the filth, the wicked thoughts, yep was the show thats hasn't shocked japan so hard in at least 10,15 years! Good animation and  start of the show, wich is too wicked, nice 3-d elements and weapons design,s. The drum& bass music  fares well throgout the show at some parts, along with good action scene music.the internal struggle of the charac. is sometimes damn creepy about the past and...stuff, oh the humanity! at least the makers of this anime put most of their potential in this part of the serie's stuff, oh the humanity! at least the makers of this anime put most of their potential in this part of the serie's"", 'You die and death greets you. Before he carts your corpse-less soul away, he offers you a sort of ""Game of Life."" If you win, you get a second chance. If you loose, well I\'m sure you can guess the repercussions.Gantz story is something more one of multiple life stories with added action. It tends to drag everything out far more than is really needed. The first 4 - 5 episodes are the introduction with the next 5 being explanations on the lives of the next crew while keeping tabs on the surviving last crew. It is almost a text book definition of a filler.Art...is decent for the most part. Scenery is done well and the occasional done 3D CG scene is something not often seen in anime. However the angles for some of these CG scenes can make the animated characters look incredibly  flat and out of place, being 2D. The major thing that kills the art is the real facial expressions. they rarely change from wide eyed shock or surprise.Sound is adequately placed and used quite well. Even background music pieces are well used and fit the scene accordingly without being so loud as to be the only thing that gets your attention. While many object stock sounds are used, one tends not to care because either the scene is explaining something or you\'re too bored to notice.The one thing that makes this seem like a filler anime is the characters. It spends so much time explaining the back story of all the characters in the second groups and only a little of one character from the first group, that there\'s only few real action sequences. Everyone\'s too soft or their personalities take a complete 180, far too easily.Enjoyment was quite low. They drag on the first few episodes far more than needed and the next how ever many episodes, nothing interesting really happens. Then when they are called upon again towards the end, everyone\'s constantly changing perspective and it takes them so damn long to do anything, you get bored of that too. is decent for the most part.

Nothing in particular happens. You see, in the manga it makes a lot of sense for your characters to slowly figure things out. And, when you realize the Gantz manga is a little under 400 chapters long, it's reasonable to assume that the characters of Gantz will only figure out the world of Gantz after about chapter 80 or so. Considering the incredible horror of alien killing, it's even more so understandable.However, in an anime that is limited to 13...episodes (and yes, I'm excluding Season Two for this review) you can't have your lead characters fumbling around constantly. They need to get better. Fast. You have a short amount of time to make things work, so get cracking. Animation is a totally different medium that, while can be more sensory, is limited to a shorter amount of time, therefore things need to move faster, MUCH faster.And, in that area, talk about slow. The pacing in this show is absolutely terrible. I think it has to do with the fact that the producers couldn't procure 24 episodes right off the bat and had to stick to 13 at first. Afterwards, they got the ok to do even more. Why this is important: They couldn't expedite earlier content to make room for latter chapters, effectively closing off the expositional arc of Gantz (somewhere around chapter 120-130). So, because of this, Gantz runs extra, extra long on scenes that turn into complete schlock. When the action flows well, it's great. When it's constant gun pointing and talking, it's very boring.Now, many will find this show offputting because the narrative is so hateful, and that's a very reasonable response. It's very evident that the writer is a straight nihilist and a pervert. There are many scenes that are clearly thrown in to be edgy, and it's laughable. There are other scenes that are horrible, completely inhumane. The latter is more fitting considering the circumstances, but when it's surrounded by disgusting 'pornography,' it seems like it doesn't belong. It's one of my biggest complaints about the earlier Gantz stories. It's not until long after these events (and the following ones that, I assume, are in Season Two) that the story reaches 9/10-10/10 territory. Of course, like a boomerang, the manga falls back down to the lowest of lows for the finale, but this isn't a review on the manga, just bringing this up for comparison.Basically, this season couldn't help but be a mess. It's all pretty dumb in the manga, too. If it wasn't for such a cool premise, Gantz would fall flat near instantly.Art:The animation is pretty dang good when things are actually happening. Proportions were occasionally off, but that's what happens when animators are told to focus on making nude females more important than clothed male forms.Scenes are varied, but most combat takes place at night. Because of this, everything sort of blends in.I liked some of the transitional cuts that were in 3D while characters were in 2D. It was a stylistic choice that was risky, but, to me, added a lot of neat ways to explore the world.I liked that this show had gore and didn't just BS some of the animation.Sound:This is an incredibly limited OST that is sparely used. At first you hear a track with vocals during a fairly intense scene and it seems as though this will happen more often than not. I would have preferred that to the rather ridiculous nonsense that came later. It's not terrible, but it's not all that great, either. Certain scenes really don't earn themselves any right to have music. They're far too gritty and disgusting to have music. Rather, hyper realistic sound effects would have been more efficient in getting across how disgusting the world of Gantz is.General combat sounded alright. Nothing memorable.Character:Talk about terrible. No one is likable save for Kato. This is definitely the fault of the source material considering I felt the same way then, but it's only made worse when the anime changed some scenes and made certain characteristics WORSE. Holy cow, it's just pure crap.Enjoyment:Lukewarm. I've read the whole manga and really disliked the opening stuff. It's not until after a huge event (those who read know) that things pick up and become really, really good. Then, of course, terrible once you get to the ending.I watched this with a bunch of friends and it was pretty fun since we all laughed at the pretty crappy junk, but we still enjoyed it since the concept is quite engaging.((If you liked this review, check out my other reviews by going to my profile and clicking the 'reviews' tab.

It's one of my biggest complaints about the earlier Gantz stories. It's not until long after these events (and the following ones that, I assume, are in Season Two) that the story reaches 9/10-10/10 territory. Of course, like a boomerang, the manga falls back down to the lowest of lows for the finale, but this isn't a review on the manga, just bringing this up for comparison.Basically, this season couldn't help but be a mess. It's all pretty dumb in the manga, too. If it wasn't for such a cool premise, Gantz would fall flat near instantly.Art:The animation is pretty dang good when things are actually happening. Proportions were occasionally off, but that's what happens when animators are told to focus on making nude females more important than clothed male forms.Scenes are varied, but most combat takes place at night. Because of this, everything sort of blends in.I liked some of the transitional cuts that were in 3D while characters were in 2D. It was a stylistic choice that was risky, but, to me, added a lot of neat ways to explore the world.I liked that this show had gore and didn't just BS some of the animation.Sound:This is an incredibly limited OST that is sparely used. At first you hear a track with vocals during a fairly intense scene and it seems as though this will happen more often than not. I would have preferred that to the rather ridiculous nonsense that came later. It's not terrible, but it's not all that great, either. Certain scenes really don't earn themselves any right to have music. They're far too gritty and disgusting to have music. Rather, hyper realistic sound effects would have been more efficient in getting across how disgusting the world of Gantz is.General combat sounded alright. Nothing memorable.Character:Talk about terrible. No one is likable save for Kato. This is definitely the fault of the source material considering I felt the same way then, but it's only made worse when the anime changed some scenes and made certain characteristics WORSE. Holy cow, it's just pure crap.Enjoyment:Lukewarm. I've read the whole manga and really disliked the opening stuff. It's not until after a huge event (those who read know) that things pick up and become really, really good. Then, of course, terrible once you get to the ending.I watched this with a bunch of friends and it was pretty fun since we all laughed at the pretty crappy junk, but we still enjoyed it since the concept is quite engaging.((If you liked this review, check out my other reviews by going to my profile and clicking the 'reviews' tab. I review virtually all anime and manga I find!))"", 'If you\'ve already decided to watch Gantz, take my advice: Always skip the Opening and End Credits.  1) they\'re sorta bad, and 2) they (the OP especially) can foreshadow or outright spoil future plot points.This show\'s core concept -- random strangers are assembled to play a game in which the rules are not clearly stated -- had great potential.  Unfortunately the anime itself was painful to watch.  I committed myself to marathoning the whole series over a couple of weeks, and I wish I hadn\'t.What\'s there to like?  Well there\'s:- Gore.  People and aliens blow up and die in horrible...ways.  I couldn\'t shake the feeling that this manga/anime was a direct influence on Psycho-Pass.- A bizarre survival plot.  Like the 1997 film ""Cube"", strangers are placed in an inexplicable situation, and are forced to save themselves while struggling to understand and work with each other.  Gradually characters discover the rules that bind them, and as they play the game again later, they learn even more.What\'s not to like?- The main character.  He\'s unlikeable, in large part that we\'re subjected to his sex-obsessed inner-monologue for the entire show.- The main heroine.  Completely useless.  Sexualized and victimized in unnerving ways.- Missed opportunities.  So many situations could have been solved if one character would\'ve said one obvious thing or grabbed one known useful item, and its frustrating to watch the characters repeat stupid mistakes when they don\'t.  This could\'ve been a cool, meaningful feature of Gantz\'s story, if only the characters recognized their mistakes after-the-fact.- Unbelievable reactions. Characters will think, say, and do things that are inconsistent with their surroundings or recent events.  Main characters and side characters stand like a deer in headlights, stupidly ignorant of the mortal threats right in front of them.  The main character may see someone die horribly right in front of him -- despite this, he\'ll be thinking about boobs instead.  This might\'ve worked if the anime were a slapstick-comedy, but that tone isn\'t used here.- The tone.  There really isn\'t any.  Music is notably absent from some scenes.  Animation relies heavily on panning and zooming, like a clumsy homage to The Maxx (1995, MTV\'s Liquid Television)- The pacing.  Dear god, it\'s abysmally slow at times.  In one episode two characters run away from the same alien with the same crappy 4 frames of animation for 10 minutes.  (the pacing does improve notably for episodes 14-26) ways.

This anime puts a light on things in a whole different way than most mainstream animes, least to be said. It actually shows the world in a rather ugly, savage light. Kei, the story´s main character, has to go through these death games and you can see him develop. Very soon he becomes badass and will kill anything that stands in the way of letting him and his friends survive. I should also say that this anime definitely isn´t meant for kids, as it doesn´t leave out any incredible, but necessary gory scenes, or sex scenes. The characters...are great, all of their personal lives and problems being shown. The animation is amazingly good, eventhough the anime was made in 2004, akthough most websites probably won´t have it in higher resolution than 360p. I definitely enjoyed this anime and it gripped me within the first few episodes. If the ending wasn´t so tragic, then it´s probably be a lot better in my opinion, though I´ve seen that the manga still goes on a lot further and the anime was just cut off for catching up to it. I deem this anime so good, it might even get a place in my top 10. Very unique. are great, all of their personal lives and problems being shown.

But in this anime version, most of the characters will scream until you have a headache, cry and watch others perish. I\'m in honest doubt that so many people would give up in a life or death situation, but I don\'t exactly know of course. Wasted potential, a whole good idea thrown away that could have been something great.So unless you want to hear ""KATO-KUN"" shrieked into your ear for a majority of the time, watch people die with little to no resistance, and spend a lot...of time not getting plot development or explanations for anything, don\'t watch this. I hoped it\'d get better and watched it since it\'s short. But it doesn\'t get better at all. Almost every single character was annoying in more than a single way and the story needs to press the pedal to the medal.And this anime also had one of the most disgusting characters I\'ve ever seen, the p**** licking dog that served no purpose to anything at all that was happening.

Never have I ever hoped the animal dies, except in Gantz.', ""The anime has a great concept, but that's all it has going for it. The characters are bland and unlikable, and their morals change so quickly. For example one of the man characters has trouble killing one of the aliens yet a minute later he squeezes one to death. None of the characters are likable or realistic, half the time their just standing around debating whether to kill an alien, while the alien does nothing but stand there even though a few minutes ago it had no trouble slicing a few characters in a matter if seconds. Even the voices of the characters are annoying,...everyone has a really high pitched voice in the dubbed version and it makes my head hurt so bad. A lot of people say that the anime has great gore, but really its just ok and it doesn't happen as often as you'd think. Most of the time the characters are talking about killing an alien or their just standing around and talking about a girls breasts. Overall I wouldn't watch the show if you want to see some intense action and agonizing whether a character will survive. Since the majority of the time its quite obvious who's going to die the main characters have plot armor while everyone seems to be extremely fragile and are as dumb as rock.Pros: good to watch in the background, gore is ok, the intro is coo, the art is decent but it does fluctuate a bit here and thereCons: All characters are idiots, none of them are likable, action is meh, the voices in the dub are so high pitched that it made my head hurt, no suspense whether a character will survive, lot of filler with nothing happening.

This anime does not contain gore in *every* episode, but I will say it is a lot. Do not watch it if you cannot stand themes such as gore, rape, murder (especially needless), immorality, and more. It's incredibly explicit. A true not safe for work anime if there ever was one. I will be going over a number of things in this review. This is just for this season of the anime.First of all, I enjoyed Gantz. I enjoyed it a lot, actually. So why...the 6 on something I enjoyed so much? Well, strap in folks, because there's levels to it. If you're into gore, and only watch gory anime like me, keep this on your plan to watch list. If you're not watching for gore, leave this out of your to watch list. Gore and action wise, Gantz was pretty satisfying.Character development was relatively shallow and nonexistent.One of the main things people fail to realize when writing reviews about the characters in this show is a key thing: Trauma makes people freeze. It does not matter how many times someone has gone through a traumatic event, trauma will and can make people freeze. That is a part of being human. The characters of Gantz freeze pretty much half of the episode, or longer. It may be annoying, but it is realistic for a human being to freeze for so long. It is realistic for someone to go through trauma, say things they will do, and then not go through with it. The brain needs time to process events, surprisingly.One of the characters is solely fan service, up until a certain point. In fact, there's a lot of fan service in this anime. There's plenty of boobs and nudity.The art was quite fine. The switch between CG and 2D animation does get a little distracting, but only if you have an eye for it. There are many times in the anime where there are still frames, and those still frames look quite botched. Though, keep in mind this is an anime from 2004, after all.Sound was decent. Nothing special, but it wasn't bad.Overall, while I personally enjoyed Gantz quite a bit, I don't believe I would recommend it to many people. the 6 on something I enjoyed so much?

I'm not sure what it is that triggers this, but it would repeat after every episode. Yet, I still continued to watch. It felt a lot like watching a schlocky b-movie. Yes the acting, the cgi, and just about everything else is shit. But there is something somewhat enticing about a giant crocodile battling it out with a giant spider. And of course all the gore is a nice bonus. And that is how I feel about Gantz. Pretty much everything about this anime royally sucks with the...small exception of an interesting plot. Speaking of which, let's get down to it.Plot/Story: The only redeeming factor of Gantz is it's concept. Keep in mind too I'm only reviewing the first season. It hints toward a possible escape/redemption scenario in the final episode. Basically the way it works is randomly selected people are transported the moment after death into a room. Their bodies are copies, and the originals just disappear from the scene of their deaths. Inside that room is a giant grey ball, or sphere, as the characters like to call it, that holds strange weapons, armor, and a bald guy with chords going into his head. This bald guy we quickly learn is Gantz. He doesn't speak, and instead makes snarky comments on the front of the sphere which is also a computer apparently. The reason our protagonists have been summoned into this room is to hunt aliens. That's pretty much it. With an hour time limit they are given a certain radius in which the aliens are hiding. Failure to capture, kill, or leaving the perimeter results in certain death. Success guarantees them to be placed back in the room and allowed to leave until they are again summoned. That is all I will say in this review but you start to learn things in the last two episodes.Characters: This will be brief. Never in my life have I seen an anime with more pathetic characters than Gantz. Even after thirteen episodes I could care less if any of them lived or died. They are painfully dumb, perverted, heartless, and selfish. The three main protagonist Kei, Katou, and Kishimoto change slightly as the story progresses but continue to stay true to their original shitty nature all the same. There is also Nishi, who you will hate more than anybody the anime/manga world has ever spawned. Everybody else is unrelated to the main plot or just a throw in during the alien hunts during the first season. I assume some of them will make a return.Sound: Honestly, I'm not one to care much about OPs or EDs. I skip them 99% of the time. However for the sake of this review I decided to watch them all the way through. I didn't think they were anything special, but not outright dreadful either. Throughout the show nothing from the sound track really caught my interest too much. But there were a few times in matched up with the atmosphere well.Art: Gantz has a weird approach to blend CGI with a traditional anime style. This will be very apparent in the opening scene of the first episode. It plays a lot like a weird click and point game from the 90s and to be entirely honest  I almost picked a different show after seeing it. Fortunately, they begin to use it less and less as the show goes on. Keeping in mind Gantz was release in '04, I tried not to keep my expectations too high. But even for an anime released over a decade ago it still felt sub par. And I'm not even talking about the CGI parts.Overall enjoyment: As I stated in the first part of this review most everything about Gantz feels half-assed. Yet it does have a certain charm that kept me watching. Overall I would say it deserves a 4/10 but I went against my better judgement and gave it a 6/10. If you like good anime, and only good anime, don't watch this. But if you can turn you're brain down to 50% and enjoy a lot of head explosions, some pretty creative aliens, or maybe you like survival scenarios, then I'd say give Gantz a watch if you're in need of a quick binge. small exception of an interesting plot.

PEACE! it out longer. you should appretiaite that technique rather that dis it. PEACE!', ""(This is only a review of the first season of Gantz. I have not watched the second yet. [English Dub])Going into watching this anime, I never thought it would teach me a lesson. What is that lesson exactly?  People suck. It's that simple. The anime did a great job of portraying this. This anime proved that the world is not as nice as it appears. There is greed, violence, and lust running rampant through the veins of this show. While Gantz does an excellent job of executing these themes, is the anime as good as it should be?Well, I'll just come out right...now and say no. Problems begin in the story/storytelling. The premise and basic plot for Gantz is bizarre, but very interesting. The basic plot consists of people dying in the real world, but instead of going to Heaven or Hell, the victims join in on a survival game. In this game, the people selected by Gantz must hunt down an exotic creature and kill it before the sixty minutes are up. Kills earn them points in the game, but I won't give anymore details in the game. What can be so bad about that? The pacing is way too slow.There are only two games during the first season, and I really think there could have been at least one more if the producers picked up the pace a lot. The episodes that separated the games were either random or repetitive. This bizarre, sluggish pace made me feel like I was being dragged through the mud by the world's slowest race horse. This series should have had a lot more action in it to keep the excitement up. A lot of the time, I would get frustrated because something that could have easily occurred within one episode was spread into three. Overall, great ideas, but horrendous pacing. (6)Along with the storyline, the art was disappointing at times too. While I liked the 2D shape in a 3D world perspective, some of the art clashed sometimes and looked a bit goofy. A lot of facial expressions were either Slenderman esque, or unreal looking. That is not a good thing in an anime which wants to convey a feeling of real people in it. Besides those flaws, the animation looks pretty good during the fight scenes and most other scenes throughout the anime. Overall, not bad, but could've been more consistent. (6)In contradiction to the last two categories, the sound in this anime were very well done. First of all, the music was fantastic. The opening theme was really zany, which was a good match to the feel of the anime' s material. However, I really, really loved the song during the ending credits. The female singing had a beautiful voice, and I think the lyrics of the song matched up with some themes of the anime pretty well. The music during the action scenes were high octane, blood rushing tunes like they should have been. The other music in other scenes matched well as well.The only thing that brings down the score here a point is some of the voice acting. While mostly all of the characters had a fitting voice for their character, some of them got on my nerves in screaming scenes in particular. I've always liked Greg Ayres' voice-acting, but when his character, Kei Kurono, screamed it gave me a little bit of a headache. His definitely was not the only one. Overall, an excellent score with pretty decent voice acting. (8)While the music was rather good in this anime, the characters were a real letdown. Our three main heroes, were decently developed, but lacked likability. First of all, I'm going to talk about Kei Kurono. Kurono is one of the most lusty, sex-crazed heroes I have ever witnessed in an anime. He has very few sensible morals, which is not a good thing. Kurono cannot make a decision and lacks the aggressiveness  expected him to have. While he gets more tolerable later in series, he still ends up being hard to  support.Along with Kurono, Kei Kishimoto is fairly unlikable. While her character design is very attractive and memorable, nothing about her personality is. She is incapable of doing much of anything for herself, and she is as bad as Kurono on the decision making level. I liked her backstory, but overall, she Kishimoto is not all that likable either. Of the three, the most likable, but still not great character, is Masaru Katou. Katou has an interesting backstory that truly makes the viewer want to cheer for him. However, I think he is a worse decision maker than the other two combined. His morals clash way too often and create a train wreck of confusion the audience. He also has a bad habit of crying at really inappropriate times, which is unintentionally laughable. With the exception of two fellows named Tetsu and Nishi, none of the supporting characters are very interesting. Many end up being flat out annoying. All in all, I believe this is the anime's main flaw. (4)How much did I enjoy Gantz? Well, as much as I possibly could. As previously stated, the overly slow pace frustrated me a lot. Watching the characters argue instead of fight things made Gantz a lot less enjoyable than it should have been. Stupid decision making by the characters also made me facepalm, per say.While it was not the main focus of the anime, the humor was pretty well done when it had relevance to the plot. A lot of the dialogue was very funny, but at times it was cringe-worthy. The humorous lines outweighed the clunky ones though. The first few, and particularly the last two episodes, are what made this anime have an enjoyment factor of a 6 rather than a 4. Overall, I enjoyed the action and humor Gantz provided, even though the pacing was way too slow. (6)Overall, Gantz was a decent anime, but could have been a whole lot better. The depiction of selfish, greedy people living in the everyday world was almost perfectly done, but the characters and pacing suffered because of it. I went into Gantz with high expectations because it was on the recommendations list of almost every show I enjoyed most. Unfortunately, a lot of those expectations were not met. I still did enjoy the uniqueness and draw of this very different anime. I hope the second season can build on these efforts and end up a point or two higher on my scale.Overall: 6/10 now and say no.

While he gets more tolerable later in series, he still ends up being hard to  support.Along with Kurono, Kei Kishimoto is fairly unlikable. While her character design is very attractive and memorable, nothing about her personality is. She is incapable of doing much of anything for herself, and she is as bad as Kurono on the decision making level. I liked her backstory, but overall, she Kishimoto is not all that likable either. Of the three, the most likable, but still not great character, is Masaru Katou. Katou has an interesting backstory that truly makes the viewer want to cheer for him. However, I think he is a worse decision maker than the other two combined. His morals clash way too often and create a train wreck of confusion the audience. He also has a bad habit of crying at really inappropriate times, which is unintentionally laughable. With the exception of two fellows named Tetsu and Nishi, none of the supporting characters are very interesting. Many end up being flat out annoying. All in all, I believe this is the anime's main flaw. (4)How much did I enjoy Gantz? Well, as much as I possibly could. As previously stated, the overly slow pace frustrated me a lot. Watching the characters argue instead of fight things made Gantz a lot less enjoyable than it should have been. Stupid decision making by the characters also made me facepalm, per say.While it was not the main focus of the anime, the humor was pretty well done when it had relevance to the plot. A lot of the dialogue was very funny, but at times it was cringe-worthy. The humorous lines outweighed the clunky ones though. The first few, and particularly the last two episodes, are what made this anime have an enjoyment factor of a 6 rather than a 4. Overall, I enjoyed the action and humor Gantz provided, even though the pacing was way too slow. (6)Overall, Gantz was a decent anime, but could have been a whole lot better. The depiction of selfish, greedy people living in the everyday world was almost perfectly done, but the characters and pacing suffered because of it. I went into Gantz with high expectations because it was on the recommendations list of almost every show I enjoyed most. Unfortunately, a lot of those expectations were not met. I still did enjoy the uniqueness and draw of this very different anime. I hope the second season can build on these efforts and end up a point or two higher on my scale.Overall: 6/10"", 'There are only two routes to arrive at the destination. One, you would either fall into the road where you will be engulfed by its mesmerizing psychological trance and the second will make you wish you have not crossed paths with the road at all.“Dark, morbid, violent, blood, gore, death, insanity…Sexy, naked, boobies...The nature of human beings…”If you can relate with the terms above, this is the anime for you....The Story (8/10)The story has a realistic feel drawn in with an awkward twist of science fiction.

It has very funny writing, and is down-right fun to watch. The show's message of how the world is an awful place is a very true one, and it's progressed through the whole show of the issues with being reborn into society, and has one of the most developed protagonists of all.Gantz isn't for everyone, but it's still one of the greats. "", ""This review is for Gantz and Gantz 2nd Stage. I talk about the manga as well since it is the superior version of the story.Story: Gantz is a sci-fi story about people dying and being transported to a room with a black ball. I won't say what happens next but part of the appeal is seeing where the story will go. It isn't predictable and at times it presents interesting situations for its characters. All of the characters are expendable throughout, which adds to the tension. The pacing of the show can be terribly slow at times and watching these normal people deal with what...is happening can be quite unpleasant. There are many explicit scenes within the story with gore and sex.Art: The art isn't anything special. The fight scenes are animated well enough but they have horrible CGI thrown in. The backgrounds are very flat but the designs of the human characters are done well enough and the monsters can be interesting. The manga uses computer generated backgrounds and overall it looks much better.Sound: The OST does a good job of adding to the tense moments. The openings are songs to get you ready for the show and the ending credits are melancholic. The voice actors do a good job for both the english and japanese voices.Character: The characters are mostly unlikable and dumb. Most people are put off by this but it's like this on purpose to try and provide realism. It's trying to show how your every day person is not ready for the things they have to go through in the story. Watching the characters slowly figure out what's happening and adjust to crazy circumstances is a big part of it's appeal. I particularly enjoyed the journey of the main character Kei Kurono, his transformation throughout the series is done very well in the anime and the manga.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the show but there are a couple things that bothered me. The first thing is that the anime does not have a true ending and you will have to switch over to the manga. Two, the 3rd arc is anime original and isn't in the manga. It's a decent arc by itself but they would've been better off ending at the 2nd arc and saving the manga source material for a potential sequel. The enjoyment of the show comes from trying to figure out what will happen next and watching the different characters deal with these outrageous situations.Overall: After all this, I really recommend you to check out the manga instead of the anime. The slow pacing is not a problem and it has some of the best sci-fi action scenes in the medium. It also has an ending and tries to explain much of the mystery surrounding the plot.

They show a lot more nudity than a usual show so that's something.The premise was actually quite interesting but the execution was more than a little sloppy. I'm sure some 200iq anime fan could explain how this show is actually deep but to me it felt immensely shallow.I don't expect a protagonist to always be likable but man, in Gantz our main guy really sucks, his motivations lack depth and meaning, his character development is literally equivalent to an on-off switch with no subtlety in...it's progression, etc etc.In summary this had some potential and squandered it.

Thanks so much for waiting on my review, I know it’s been a while, but I’m back and ready for a new year of reviews! This review covers all 26 episodes.Started: 2/7/18Completed: 2/11/18“Gantz” is an anime that came out back in 2004 while I was only 10 years old. During that time, I was only familiar with anime on 4KidsTV or other Saturday morning cartoon programs, before getting into the shows on cable when I reached middle school that following year.. With that being said, it’s no surprise why I’ve never seen this anime much sooner, I was WAY too young to handle...or understand its mature content.Now that I’m older, I can say with confidence that this show is entertaining, and a solid example of early to mid 2000s anime.Story: The story is unique and it gets right into the plot in the first episode. The first episode is also where we see just how gritty and gorey it is. With that being said, I don’t believe this show relies on gore to tell it’s story, it has other elements. (Romance, crime, family drama, sex, etc.)Art: I liked the art style! It reminds me of the early 2000s (one of my favorite eras, if you couldn’t tell, because it was a big part of my childhood) and we get to see some CGI use. At times, the CGI got annoying and when the characters were moving, it just looked weird. For example in Episode one, two of the main characters will be running in the subway, and it just looked weird to me…Sound: I did not watch the Japanese dub, instead I went for English because it was overed on VRV and I was lazy and tired from work and school, so I gave in. The voice acting wasn’t bad, I felt like all of the characters were portrayed by people who fit them really well. The music was a pleasure! The opening theme “Super Shooter” by Rip Slyme was lit and it kept me pumped each and every episode, I NEVER got tired of it. The ending theme “Last Kiss” by Bonnie Pink was moving and it fit right in with how fast paced and aggressive this show was.Character: I liked all of the characters, each had a lasting impression on me after they passed away...Kurono Kei was my favorite because I could relate to him the most. Kishimoto was a favorite of mine because she was sweet (ish), Kato was a noble, stand up guy and deserved the cat (hahaha) and I have a soft spot for Sei.Enjoyment: This show had me hooked! I finished it in like five days, it was SO good and I’m adding it to my rewatch queue and recommending to everyone I know.Overall: I give this show a 8. It’s a good anime with memorable characters and story line and theme music. It’s definitely one I recommend to my older anime watchers, if you’re under 17, you should wait until your older to understand the content in this piece.Thanks so much for reading! Sorry for the wait, I’m busy with work, school and being a mommy. My next review will be on Sanrio Danshi Check my page for updates and feel free to reach out and follow my Facebook page “Moon Baby Doll” and join my anime group “Grown and Otaku.” See ya later! or understand its mature content.Now that I’m older, I can say with confidence that this show is entertaining, and a solid example of early to mid 2000s anime.Story: The story is unique and it gets right into the plot in the first episode.

But if there is ever an anime I would 10/10 times recommend people to read as a manga instead, then it is Gantz.Gantz anime is a total shit-show that is caused by a lot of different factors. So why don\'t we dig into the negatives first?First of all, there is the art style. I do understand this is a 2004 animation so I can\'t be too hard on this, but man is it bad. It may be my...fault for only realizing it actually has a 720p resolution after I\'ve watched the first 5-6 episodes on 480p, but the 720 doesn\'t do it any favors either. The animation is so linear and boring that it hurts to watch. And then there is the weird and awkward attempts at CGI that just feels and looks super laggy and buggy.Again, I can\'t be too hard since the anime is from 2004, but it lacks any sort of charm that older animations excel at. Look at One Piece, Bleach and YYH animation from early days - they have that charm and they seem lively and colorful. I\'m not asking for Gantz characters to have 2-3 feet high and wide mouths when they laugh, and I do get that they were going for a more ""realistic"" portrayal, but it just doesn\'t do anything for me. There isn\'t anything unique to it and every single character looks the same with the exception of their hair colors. There are no textures, no detail. I feel like if this was a 3D pop-up book and I stroked my hand over it, it would still feel flat.Then there is the PACING! Oh god, the pacing. Let me explain it like this: character A tells character B to shoot a villain.B says he’s going to do it, then B goes into 5 minute inner monologueThe villain attacks, B hasn’t shot yetA + bystanders again tell B to shoot itB has a dialogue with the others now for 2-3 minutes,Villain almost kills BB finally shoots but misses the first 5-15 shots.About 5-10 minutes could go where the characters would literally just stand there and dialogue while watching another character getting beat to death, or they are running away for 5-10 minutes without actually doing anything.It feels like every episode is 50+ minutes long and not 20. They truly have mastered the art of stretching literally everything out in an anime. Several of the episodes have been so awfully slow that I envy everyone that didn\'t waste their time with this. But since I am someone that gives every anime a chance and fully watches at least 1 season, this was painful.So, now to the characters. Since the anime is really slow paced, that would at least leave a lot of time for character development, right? Oh, how I was fooled. We have a perverted, good-for-nothing, kinda bad person MC that doesn\'t really get any development until the last 2-3 episodes of the season. We have a good-hearted side character that\'s completely blind to the reality he is facing, and then there is the stereotypical big breasted female character that acts like a good person, but is in reality extremely annoying and useless.We are supposed to feel bad for the male and female side characters Kei and Kato because of their backstories, but we only ever really follow the male one, Kato. And to be honest, I was kind of interested in Kato because of his sweet character and morals + the fact that his parents died and now he\'s left to his aunt (I believe) that hits him and his little brother. His only goal is to come back from the ""Gantz game"" and give his younger brother a great life. Oh, and he also received some development when he brutally beat a guy to near death when he tried to *TW* rape and beat Kato up. Too bad it is one of the only instances where Kato actually grows some balls in the first season.Well our MC is pretty much like any other character that got isekai\'d. A guy that never really got anything going in life and therefore grew a ""whatever"" mentality. One day he got hit by train-kun and died. He is now a part of a ""game"" called Gantz where this Gantz person creates copies of their otherwise dead bodies and forces them to fight aliens in order to gain points. So that\'s what they do, despite hesitating in almost every single episode.It is a shame that the only somewhat interesting characters with potential for development like Nishi (fake villain arrogant boy), Hojo (long-haired pretty boy model nicknamed ""fag""), ""Sadako"" (stalker girl that stalks model) and the biker dude just end up dying without even having that much screen-time or voice-acting lines. Though I do appreciate our MC a bit more because he seems like the only character in this anime to actually be somewhat realistic.Now to the final and worst part, plot. Is there really an actual plot here? If anyone watches this without knowing about the manga, they would probably be confused as hell. They manage to somehow ruin an otherwise pretty damn solid manga, by giving it the absolute most generic and linear plot of all time. If I were to explain the plot it would probably be something like ""People die and are transferred to a room where they get high-tech weapons and suits to kill aliens"". That\'s literally it. I am literally laughing out loud.The funniest part was when I searched for ""most disturbing anime"" on google and I saw this anime, they described it as a gory, grotesque and psychological horror anime with rape and murdering. LMFAO!! it may have blood and severed limbs, but the animation for it is so low-budget I wouldn\'t even categorize it as ""gore"". And psychological? Where? The Gantz figure that forces them to kill aliens? Please don\'t make me laugh now.The anime doesn\'t offer or give us anything. They just do what they do, because. And it\'s a shame, because I feel like the anime has so much untapped potential that they absolutely fail to realize until it\'s too late in the second season - the final season. There is no backstory to who and what Gantz is, why he/she wants them to kill aliens or why people are transferred to a room after death.And maybe the most important question: is Gantz actually the villain here? Since it is making the deceased people basically fight for their lives without telling them anything in detail, and by killing aliens that pretty much didn\'t even bother humans until they were bothered with themselves. There is also the sadistic traits Gantz showcases like when the contestants are transferred to the room, the message on a huge black ""Gantz ball"" says ""your lives are now over, you bastard. What happens to you from now on is up to me to decide"". They could\'ve easily kept going by giving us at least 1% more about who and what Gantz really is, but they *spoiler warning* don\'t tell us jack shit from now and up until the end of the anime.The only things we learned were that if you manage to get 100 points, you are somehow ""freed"", and that the guns they have have a time lag and they can lock on targets.And what\'s with the deaths? Literally a bunch of deaths and bad choices could\'ve been avoided in this show if the people like Nishi actually told the others about everything he knew, before he was about to die at least. Especially our main characters we follow since they already made it alive through the first game. When they got in the game the second time, they could\'ve at least tried to explain the people present about what they knew, instead of hesitating and start taking 10 years before they explain something. The others might\'ve not believed them, but they could\'ve showcased how the suits worked, how the guns worked and about the aliens, and then let it be up to the individual whether or not they want to believe it or not,The story never really develops or builds any layers so that people would actually want to watch a second season, and again - huge shame.Now that was a lot of negative points so let\'s end it on a positive note. I love how they portrayed society realistically. We have all the bad and ugly sides of society, and it is in full effect in this anime, already from the first episode. A hobo falls onto the train tracks and the camera pans over to several random characters and we hear their inner thoughts. A lot of the people act like ""oh, someone fell, I hope someone saves that man"" but the fact that no one actually acts and helps the man, tells a lot about societies. People know and feel what is morally right, but they won\'t do it. Whether it be because they are scared, don\'t care or hope someone else does it, this technique where we hear the inner thoughts was pretty good. Too bad that not even this technique was utilized ever again since the first episode and aside from our MC\'s thoughts.And we also see a lot of character types throughout. We have the perverts, the rapists, gang-members, spoiled brats, annoying people, the hesitant people, the ""know it all"" and the generally good people but with a hidden dark side. They truly don\'t pull any punches when trying to portray a real-life society.And where there any good scenes? Sure, yeah. The scene where our MC Kei tries to beat up the first alien we encounter to save his childhood friend Kato and love-interest Kei, was pretty solid.Then there is the very sad scene that managed to hit me pretty hard. The one where the grandmother and grandkid died and got sent to Gantz game, and when they encounter an alien and the grandmother tells her grandson to run away, only for her to be attacked by the aliens. Her young grandson goes back to try and help her, but it is already too late. Their last moments was the grandmother trying to shield her grandson from the aliens, only for them to die in the hands of each other. Just typing this in makes me absolutely sad. As someone that has an amazing relationship with his grandmother, this scene is equally as sad as it is sweet.And then there is also the absolute badass scene where our MC Kei beats the second alien villain without the help of his superpower suit. That at least gave us a bit of character development, despite it being near the end of the season.Overall this was a pretty hard to watch first season, mainly because of all the points I have above, but also because I know about the manga and how the manga ends. And I know how much they shit the bed with this anime, because this really had potential to be a 7 or even and 8/10 anime if they just tried. Overall this was pretty bad, 4/10. fault for only realizing it actually has a 720p resolution after I\'ve watched the first 5-6 episodes on 480p, but the 720 doesn\'t do it any favors either.

So that\'s what they do, despite hesitating in almost every single episode.It is a shame that the only somewhat interesting characters with potential for development like Nishi (fake villain arrogant boy), Hojo (long-haired pretty boy model nicknamed ""fag""), ""Sadako"" (stalker girl that stalks model) and the biker dude just end up dying without even having that much screen-time or voice-acting lines. Though I do appreciate our MC a bit more because he seems like the only character in this anime to actually be somewhat realistic.Now to the final and worst part, plot. Is there really an actual plot here? If anyone watches this without knowing about the manga, they would probably be confused as hell. They manage to somehow ruin an otherwise pretty damn solid manga, by giving it the absolute most generic and linear plot of all time. If I were to explain the plot it would probably be something like ""People die and are transferred to a room where they get high-tech weapons and suits to kill aliens"". That\'s literally it. I am literally laughing out loud.The funniest part was when I searched for ""most disturbing anime"" on google and I saw this anime, they described it as a gory, grotesque and psychological horror anime with rape and murdering. LMFAO!! it may have blood and severed limbs, but the animation for it is so low-budget I wouldn\'t even categorize it as ""gore"". And psychological? Where? The Gantz figure that forces them to kill aliens? Please don\'t make me laugh now.The anime doesn\'t offer or give us anything. They just do what they do, because. And it\'s a shame, because I feel like the anime has so much untapped potential that they absolutely fail to realize until it\'s too late in the second season - the final season. There is no backstory to who and what Gantz is, why he/she wants them to kill aliens or why people are transferred to a room after death.And maybe the most important question: is Gantz actually the villain here? Since it is making the deceased people basically fight for their lives without telling them anything in detail, and by killing aliens that pretty much didn\'t even bother humans until they were bothered with themselves. There is also the sadistic traits Gantz showcases like when the contestants are transferred to the room, the message on a huge black ""Gantz ball"" says ""your lives are now over, you bastard. What happens to you from now on is up to me to decide"". They could\'ve easily kept going by giving us at least 1% more about who and what Gantz really is, but they *spoiler warning* don\'t tell us jack shit from now and up until the end of the anime.The only things we learned were that if you manage to get 100 points, you are somehow ""freed"", and that the guns they have have a time lag and they can lock on targets.And what\'s with the deaths? Literally a bunch of deaths and bad choices could\'ve been avoided in this show if the people like Nishi actually told the others about everything he knew, before he was about to die at least. Especially our main characters we follow since they already made it alive through the first game. When they got in the game the second time, they could\'ve at least tried to explain the people present about what they knew, instead of hesitating and start taking 10 years before they explain something. The others might\'ve not believed them, but they could\'ve showcased how the suits worked, how the guns worked and about the aliens, and then let it be up to the individual whether or not they want to believe it or not,The story never really develops or builds any layers so that people would actually want to watch a second season, and again - huge shame.Now that was a lot of negative points so let\'s end it on a positive note. I love how they portrayed society realistically. We have all the bad and ugly sides of society, and it is in full effect in this anime, already from the first episode. A hobo falls onto the train tracks and the camera pans over to several random characters and we hear their inner thoughts. A lot of the people act like ""oh, someone fell, I hope someone saves that man"" but the fact that no one actually acts and helps the man, tells a lot about societies. People know and feel what is morally right, but they won\'t do it. Whether it be because they are scared, don\'t care or hope someone else does it, this technique where we hear the inner thoughts was pretty good. Too bad that not even this technique was utilized ever again since the first episode and aside from our MC\'s thoughts.And we also see a lot of character types throughout. We have the perverts, the rapists, gang-members, spoiled brats, annoying people, the hesitant people, the ""know it all"" and the generally good people but with a hidden dark side. They truly don\'t pull any punches when trying to portray a real-life society.And where there any good scenes? Sure, yeah. The scene where our MC Kei tries to beat up the first alien we encounter to save his childhood friend Kato and love-interest Kei, was pretty solid.Then there is the very sad scene that managed to hit me pretty hard. The one where the grandmother and grandkid died and got sent to Gantz game, and when they encounter an alien and the grandmother tells her grandson to run away, only for her to be attacked by the aliens. Her young grandson goes back to try and help her, but it is already too late. Their last moments was the grandmother trying to shield her grandson from the aliens, only for them to die in the hands of each other. Just typing this in makes me absolutely sad. As someone that has an amazing relationship with his grandmother, this scene is equally as sad as it is sweet.And then there is also the absolute badass scene where our MC Kei beats the second alien villain without the help of his superpower suit. That at least gave us a bit of character development, despite it being near the end of the season.Overall this was a pretty hard to watch first season, mainly because of all the points I have above, but also because I know about the manga and how the manga ends. And I know how much they shit the bed with this anime, because this really had potential to be a 7 or even and 8/10 anime if they just tried. Overall this was pretty bad, 4/10.', 'Gantz is an oddity, at least for me. In fact, while watching it, I wasn\'t sure if I even enjoyed it. There are so many things that make Gantz bad, so many hurdles to get over and strange choices in production to overcome. And yet, I find myself thinking fondly of this show in the way you think fondly of that video of a train crash you watched. It\'s so bad; it\'s awful, so much destruction and horror. But you just can\'t pull yourself away from it.Much like a horrific train crash, Gantz is a messed up show. I don\'t mean messed up like ""oh,...yeah, lotta people get killeded to death."" No, I mean you have some down and dirty stuff going on. Blood, gore, murder, grotesque violence, naked women, gratuitous sexual themes and situations, depraved and sexual desires, sexual assault (multiple counts), emotional trauma, selfish cowardice, the ever turning meatgrinder of death... you name it, Gantz probably has it.So, this is not for the feint of heart. Okay, so who is this show for? Honestly, I couldn\'t tell you. I certainly didn\'t think I liked this show, but it was the first anime that made me go and read it\'s manga (the first manga I\'ve actually ever read). So Gantz is doing something correct, right?Well, I guess it does capture the sense of hopeless despair of being in a dangerous and deadly situation, where your odds of survival are slim to none. And it also displayed human nihilism pretty well and shows you the horrors of being an optimist (it don\'t end well for your ass).Okay, okay, I\'m getting off topic. Look, if you want a show where dudes (and dudettes) get forced to put on latex suits and use space blasters to go shoot aliens with blood and gore and cursing and boobies, then Gantz is the show for you. You just have to be able to put up with a pretty insufferable main character (he\'s consistent, at least), a super naive and kinda stupid sidekick (at least he\'s consistent, I guess), and you don\'t get too attached to characters then...Yeah, Gantz is probably for you. yeah, lotta people get killeded to death.""

When it comes to live action cinema, I’d say it’s action that gets the same treatment, be it anything directed by Michael Bay, or whatever the fuck Bruce Willis is getting up to these days, and I suppose if I were to draw this out further to video games, then the likes of Call of Duty are rather similar. Now, on the surface, something like K-On and Transformers might...seem diametrically opposed, but I’d say there’s something they both have in common – a disregard for story, and a carefree tone. Gantz incorporates only one of these, it has story so minimal it makes K-On’s seem convoluted by comparison, but it does not go for the carefree “let’s just kill people and have a good time” attitude that most action employs. Rather, it goes for edginess, to the extreme. And for the record, edginess is one of those internet buzzwords that gets thrown around a lot and so its definition seems to get diluted because of that, I am not defining edginess herein as a reliance on gore, vulgarity, and other provocative content, but rather, the implementation of it to a distasteful degree, and that’s Gantz's main problem, it is not tasteful, I have absolutely no problem with the usage of innocent people being attacked and such, but in Gantz, that is all that happens.So, to wrap to the beginning, the very beginning, Gantz opens with a typical Japanese high school student fantasising about one of his classmates naked, and they wasted zero time informing me that they had no comprehension of the word subtlety, because though there was a POV shot of it very early on, and I figured the fact she is facing away from him would have obscured most of the nudity, they instead decided to move the camera around so I could see it in all its glory, and there wasn’t much glory to be found, animation was a step below what I expect, even for something from the early 2000’s. Fast forward a bit, and after a bit of narration from the main character who is a complete misanthrope that hates everyone and everything, who then saves a drunk tramp from getting run over by a train, for no reason, he states multiple times throughout that it’s completely unlike him and he has no reason to do it, which I agree with, it was completely contradictory to his character, but anyway, he does that, and then the train comes, and rather than climb up the platform, which didn’t seem too implausible, it wasn’t a huge height, he instead decides to outrun the train, and gets decapitated, because apparently Japanese trains have buzzsaws on them. At least, that’s the only explanation I can produce as to how it happened, was a real clean decapitation, I’m not even sure medieval executioners would’ve been that accurate.So, he dies, and comes back to life, in some room with a giant bowling ball that tells him if he wants to live then he, among with various other people who have died, have to kill an alien. The first of these is some green Bart Simpson looking motherfucker, and I must say, for an enemy that made so little effort to violently retaliate, it sure took them a long ass time, sci-fi guns and all, and when it comes to sci-fi outfits, I’ve seen plenty of strange ones, but never before have I seen them just be MoCap suits, but anyway, after some slightly badly orchestrated action sequences, including a lot of running on streets that are extremely narrow and devoid of any turns at all, but anyway, radioactive Bart Simpson dies, and that’s the first arc done, and after this point it goes from a bad action to an abysmal fucking nothing. That’s the story of the first arc, and after this point, there is none, it is nothing, it is a compilation of people being mistreated, and nothing more. People getting bullied, people getting extorted, people getting domestically abused, you get the picture, there is nothing going on, it’s kind of common sense, if you want me to feel sorry for the bad situations that these characters in, then you’ve got to actually show me something more than them getting abused, you need more than that. The same reason you can’t just start in medias res and never explain what preceded. Basically, this is the only thing that happens after episode 4 or so, people getting hurt, a little downtime where nothing happens, and then back to more of it, it is tosh.As a further note, our main character’s a horny teenager like the rest of them, under normal circumstances I’d perhaps praise him for not being terrified at the sight of anything sexual like most anime protagonists are, and fair enough, it’s crude but there’s nothing inherently wrong with being solely interested in having a shag, but there is one problem, when it comes to actually doing anything, he’s as scared of taking action as any other. Consider, for instance, there is a point in which he gets a nekogirl living with him who’s completely subservient and evidently puts up no resistance of any sort. Now, this bloke is someone who is so unrelenting in trying to have a shag I absolutely would not put raping her past him, and it’d fit with the tone of the rest of the show, but he doesn’t, because apparently just like some invisible force in episode 1 caused him to save someone he had no interest in saving, some invisible force stopped him from doing it, just because.Also, not a huge fan of the trope of having the main characters be trapped in some forcefield, I’d much rather have our main characters be incentivised into staying within this area and actually have a reason to kill aliens for the giant bowling ball, a lot more compelling that way, I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to prefer a character who pursues something he desires but has to acquire through undesirable means, to return to action cinema, the protagonist’s wife being taken hostage is a classic example of that, a lot better than just being boxed in.So, basically, Gantz is the opposite of art, it starts off weak but barely tolerably so, yet after the first arc devolves into an absolute nothing, people getting attacked and nothing else, maybe I’d feel sorry for them if literally anything fucking else ever happened to these people, but it doesn’t, Vertov might be a boring montage devoid of character or story, but at least it has the integrity to not try and be provocative with constant violence, I enjoy violence in fiction just as much as anyone else, it can be a work’s raison d’etre, but there must be at least something else in there. And, considering the author went so far as to call Gantz the tosh that it is in Inuyashiki, one of his later works, then I suppose that puts things into perspective, it takes a lot to admit that something you spent years working on is in fact terrible, and I can respect that, I’m not sure most people could do it, which exemplifies just how bad Gantz is, so bad that the author felt it necessary to acknowledge it. seem diametrically opposed, but I’d say there’s something they both have in common – a disregard for story, and a carefree tone.

Half of the deaths could have been prevented if they\'d act instead of cry/wait/cower/have a flashback.The story is pretty good, the characters are okay and there are some major plottwists that mindf*ck you. It\'s an anime you\'d have to watch all the way to truely understand.I really liked it but sometimes the inaction is so frustrating that i felt like screaming ""c\'mon, do something!"" at my screen.I also really liked the dog, he was a cute/funny element (and no, not the licking scenes) ', ""My first introduction to Gantz was Gantz.0 on netflix. I have read about this show in regards to the violence and sci fi nature, so I thought I would give it a go.

I tend to like more of the violent types of Anime, so this was good for that. Lots of graphic violence and languageWhat wasn't good?Here is where I really got annoyed with the show.The characters are so incredibly annoying and horrible. The main characters are so whiny...and indecisive. They are constantly afraid and complaining about things.  They are afraid to kill the aliens, unsure if it good or bad to do, even when they are told thats how they get back to normal.

Its so unbelievably stupid, alien attacks one person, everyone else stands around and watches and doesnt shoot. I understand its make believe, but if a bunch of people are standing around with weapons, alien goes after one in the group (and sticks around for a while as they talk), the others dont shoot.So much of each episode is about them thinking about what to do, or saying what should be done. This makes things drag on for so long. And it takes forever to find out what is the point to anything.There are some of the bad stereotype characters. The old grandma who is useless, the child who is always crying, the bikers who are thugs, horny teenager etc. The other thing is these are supposed to be grade 10 kids, but they look like full grown adults.I spend a bunch of time yelling at the screen about how stupid they are or how annoying they are. If you can get past that, then its not bad. Too bad they did such a crap job of the characters, which ruin an otherwise good show. and indecisive.

Its filled to the brim with some of the laziest techniques of creating tension but at some point or another it stops generating tension and starts generating anger like just shoot the thing already just say what you are going to say...walk where you are going to walk JUST DO IT ALREADY!Not to mention its incredibly predictable but there isn\'t even a good cast to keep you interested. Kato was the only good one but he\'s treated like a piece of human garbage by the dumpster fire that is the protagonist. There was absolutely no point where I felt pity for the protagonist and several times I wish he would\'ve just genuinely died and maybe took the disgusting excuse for a comedy relief dog out with him. The girl was okay but her character was ruined constantly by the perverted dog that the anime added in for....comedy?? shock?? either way it wasn\'t funny at all and shock value is a very, very, very lazy way of generating horror. Not to mention, the dog scenes were super unnecessary and way too long. This show takes elements that can be used for horror and converts it into shock value sexual nonsense instead of actually building up anything genuinely scary/horrifying. I mean yeah I guess a horny dog can be horrifying but of all the things for them to choose from, ""horny dog"" shouldn\'t have even been on their list.Last thing I\'m gonna say is that the animation is appalling.  I don\'t mind the style itself but the quality is just plain cheap looking. There is a run cycle for Kato in the first episode that is blatantly a loop that skips a frame every couple of seconds and for how much he is moving his legs he is not going nearly fast enough. The whole train scene was a disaster because the train is moving slow motion to show they\'re about to get hit, but Kato and Kei aren\'t in slow motion so it left me wondering for a second ""how did they die when the train was barely moving?"". Another time the girl is running and she is clipping through different parts of the background, her legs are moving faster than how far she is moving, just basic mistakes the studio should\'ve caught in editing.tl;dr when I saw it was rated R i was expecting naked bodies or brutal murders or torture or literally anything besides a vagina licking dog.

No I don't) but this one was so bad it took me over a month to finish simply because I heard great things about it. Trust me when I say it's trash, please.Characters... trash, complete retards. I could understand panicking in a situation like this, but even then I can't imagine someone waiting to shoot something...after it kills 2 people and even then still struggling with your mind the MC is a complete a*shole with a moral problem.Art... I disliked this too if you want to watch gore go watch Elven lied or Another (great anime i.m.o)Story... what is Gantz? never fully explained. (maybe in season 2 but I learned my lesson in the first season.) Characters introduced like fly's and dying left and right for no reason except gore. the main cast is a clusterf*ck of brain problems.Sound... OST is disgusting, so bad I skipped it every time that's how bad it was, although I must confess I do sometimes skip OST because I'm a binge watcher.Enjoyment... I loved it... sarcasm aside, it's the anime I regret watching at all and if I was offered 20$ I still wouldn't watch it. I wasted precious time of my life watching this :'-(.Overall... I hope to stop anyone from watching this. I watched this over a year ago yet it still haunts my memories so I wanted to make a review about it. This is also the only review I have made so far.Conclusion... Don't watch this sh*t.

can be considered stupid, but enjoyable because trust me this anime can get really stupid at times.The story begins with Kei Kurono who ends up dying by a train while saving a homeless man, but he ends up in a round with a black ball known as Gantz so along with other people who have also recently died Kei must kill vicious monsters in order to avoid dying permanently.Now the concept of the story actually seems pretty good, but in execution it wasn't exactly amazing, I will be honest it was interesting learning...about the rules and what you need to do when you are sent into the game which consists of killing monsters or teleporting them out of the area depending on the weapon you have available and depending on how many monsters you kill you are earned a certain amount of points, but just because you follow the rules doesn't mean the game is fair as Gantz will always find a way to screw over the people fighting in the game.The worst part about the story is pretty much the actions and decisions that the characters do because these people are dumb as hell because there are multiple moments where they could have saved someone from dying if they had just done something, but instead they just stand there waiting for the guy to die and then theydo something it was incredibly frustrating to see this and even when they are outside of the game because when you have completed killing monsters in one of the sessions you do go back to the real world the characters are still goddamn stupid.There are pretty much only 3 characters to take note of because pretty much every other character dies in this show and it's not really a surprise when you read the description of the show.Kei Kurono is the male MC and he is a perverted asshole really, he mainly cares about the well being of himself, but there are moments he does try to care for others though it never goes well however unlike most of the characters of the show he actually does fight back against the monsters effectively and there was even one time where he ended up in a session without his suit and he miraculously survived.Masaru Katou is the other male MC and he is pretty much the complete opposite of Kei despite being an old friend of his, Katou is a caring and protective person, but he doesn't like to hurt others either which pretty much doesn't help in a game where you have to survive by fighting and because of this it made me very frustrated at Katou most of the time, but he had a good personality which was a plus for another character.Kei Kishimoto is the female MC and is pretty much the fanservice for this show which is obvious just by looking at her, Kishimoto is gentle and kind hearted, but she is very clueless around the boys.The artstyle was actually ok since the design of the monsters did range in scope over time as the more missions the characters survived the tougher the monsters got and some looked like they would annihilate you instantly, the suits that the characters had to wear despite simple were pretty cool since they could augment the wearers strength for a certain amount of time, even the weapons that the players had to use were pretty cool too despite not being easy to use.The action was done pretty well despite the ridiculous actions and decisions the characters made the battles were still entertaining as a lot of the characters would either die quickly or survive by the skin of their teeth and seeing the characters desperately trying to kill the monsters before the time limit runs out was actually pretty damn tense.There was a lot of psychological aspects in this show that make it quite difficult to watch where there are even moments of attempted rape which was very difficult to watch and the gore factor in this show was really messed up, the way a lot of characters die was mostly instant, but horrifying as the monsters always have a different approach to killing the players and some of the results are definitely not forgettable.There is also pretty excessive amounts of fanservice, but luckily this is only secluded to Kishimoto since she is the only good looking female character in the show and the fanservice shown could even rival some Ecchi's I've seen.Overall this is a very mixed first season and considering the way this season went it probably won't be better in the second season, so if you're interested in watching stupid characters survive against impossible odds then you'll probably find some enjoyment out of this. about the rules and what you need to do when you are sent into the game

So I'll do my analysis the same way the anime showed: with sloppiness and really messy because it's not even worth the time to do a serious analysis. This anime has a very slow pace, very bad scene montage and cutscenes. The firstfruits is good, but the characters and the way they are shown is all bad. Shallow characters, who talk a lot but have little to say. The anime is lost with half of it worrying about showing bullies being bullies with others for free or not (seriously the main plot could be summarized in...6 episodes of so much waste made by the script) and some fan services, also free and many of them unnecessary that only delay the main focus of the plot and the narrative. And it does so because it does, without evolving the script, plot and characters. When we have the action scenes, the characters start to make surreal decisions that clearly run away from any human rationality to the point that you hope they die. Speaking of hoping they die, the narrative makes you start to feel disgusted with the protagonist and that disgust only increases more and more until the end because he is despicable. The narrative is told slowly and even slower are the action scenes, making the anime boring to watch. To get an idea, the script is so slow that it arrives at the end of the 13 episodes and they only faced 2 different races of aliens! Anyway. Terrible direction that lost more than half of the anime with creation, presentation and narrative plastering of totally disposable and not at all fluid situations!Note 4.And, honestly, this anime having a 7 on MAL must be from old grades because for the time maybe it could be a good thing. But still, even for the time it is a very high note.Let's see the second season. But I believe that, apparently, with 13 episodes, nothing will last and I already have a view that it is another great first fruit wasted! Damn Kim Kataguiri who referred me to this. It was a total waste of time! 6 episodes of so much waste made by the script) and some fan services, also free and many of them unnecessary that only delay the main focus of the plot and the narrative.

It was a total waste of time!"", 'Spoilers below!I\'ve heard that Gantz was great, I think they must have meant the manga and that would mean that another manga got a shitty adaptation. And it really feels like it adapted from something good. The concept is good, Gantz (the black sphere) has a good sense of humor that fits the dark and gory themes and we even got some sort of critique of human society. The train scene is pretty good, we see that nobody wants to help but everyone wants to blame those who are not helping. If you help someone but you\'re too slow, people blame your incompetence. It\'s a...bit extreme but basically humans are crap and yes we have crap potential as a society. So what\'s wrong with Gantz then? Everything else I think? This anime seems like it\'s made by a pissed off misogynistic homophobic 15 years old virgin, I\'m not kidding.Where do I start? The protagonist is one of the most obnoxious, unlikable, disgusting excuse of a human being. He\'s almost on-par with Crime Zone\'s protagonist (he\'s a damsel in distress that asks enemies to kidnap him, then gets saved and smells the heroine\'s ass while she\'s unconscious, but that\'s another story). He has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, he\'s just some sleazy guy with erectile hyperfunction that somehow lives alone but has no job. He\'s also a coward and has an annoying voice (english dub). There\'s an enemy that cornered him after literally 15 minutes of running away, so now he has to fight back! He has 2-3 flashbacks and he screams ""I mustn\'t run away I\'m not scared"" or something along those lines... then he slides under the enemy\'s legs and continue running away. He also has plot armor when needed.Other protagonists involves Kato, a guy who\'s too nice for his own good and it ends up hindering him. That\'s about it but he\'s a decent character. The girl is little more than fanservice on two legs. She gets saved, she\'s scared, she thinks of herself a pet and she is prone to get raped, although to be fair, nearly everyone in the anime has rapist tendencies so it\'s not her fault. You\'d think having a slim figure and huge boobs in a skin-tight suit would be enough for fanservice but she needs to be naked at least half the time.Other characters in general are assholes in a way except for a few exceptions. One guy acts as exposition, he\'s very calm, cold and calculating and uses other as bait to increase his own survival. Then the next time we see him, he\'s suddenly a gigantic asshole, then is put in a bad situation where nobody helps him because he\'s being a dick even when dying. Then after they kill the alien, cheap drama demands that he has a sad death because poor him. I think being part of ""the game"" for as long as he did would make him colder, more calculating, more savvy, less sane, etc. so he could have been a good character but nah we need assholes.Another issue is that characters are incompetent. I know I\'m just a nobody behind my computer and I\'m not put under the stress of their situation, but really now? They can\'t climb a train platform? It takes five seconds top and they can even help pull each other up. Running away in panic because a huge guy with claws is attacking? Yeah that\'s pretty normal but over the course of two episodes (where\'s all that stamina coming from anyway) ? Waist high water slows you down sure but it doesn\'t take that much time to cross a few meters. We have around 10 people each missions who can\'t point a gun at something and shoot. Even the veteran dude is incompetent. He gets invisible and run away but somehow that doesn\'t work for him and he can\'t use a gun either.Yet another big issue is the slow pacing. Those 13 episodes could easily have fit in 4 episodes. Gantz has potential, but waste it all. It\'s one of those anime that are seinen in name only. It\'s a kid imagining what a seinen is like. It has no maturity but a lot of gore and nudity, I\'m fine with both, I love stuff like Ghost in the Shell, Battle Royale and Berserk. It also has stupid dialogues.Gems:""That guy said if he get 100 points we\'re free to go!""""Does that mean if I get 100 points I will be free to go?""""The more aliens you kill, the more points you get, I understand now!"" (geez, it\'s episode 13, you get a enemy bio, a suit and weapons and the game is over only after the aliens have been killed, I suppose you could say that killing aliens is the objective!!!) bit extreme but basically humans are crap and yes we have crap potential as a society.

""Its like this in every single fight scene its so annoying, especially the way the characters just stand there while everyone is dying or someone is asking for help. It is somewhat realistic tho because in real life people wont want to get involved with problems that do not benefit them.And dont get me started on the sexual frustrated main character....The nudity is unneeded The nudity is unneeded', 'I found Gantz to be a very enjoyable watch and I ended up binging it all in 2 days. This review is for the entirety of the show, which is split into two parts on MAL. I suggest watching the English dub if you do get around to Gantz. It had a lot of personality and it was hilarious.Overall opinion:I loved watching Gantz. The characters are unlikable at times, punchable even, and I only liked that more as I found myself cheering for different people. The main character is someone who is unlikable but so funny, honest and blunt, and realistic (at times) that I...liked him more. The whole point of it is that he\'s a jerk, he\'s not supposed to be a ""good"" person. Obviously you wouldn\'t be friends with someone like that in real life, but having a show about them should not mean the show is ""unwatchable"", but to each their own.  There were some boring, overplayed moments, but some really great ones to compensate for that. Some episodes dragged on, and if there were additional episodes that went more into character backstories, development, and relations, it\'d be a much better balance and would make the show a 10/10 for me.The violence was fine, I don\'t think it was senseless or tasteless at all. However, there was a lot of fan service that might make someone uncomfortable (I usually despise fan service), but in Gantz I just found it humorous because of how often it was, and also because of the context.There was definitely too much arguing about what to do in the fight scenes, and that made some moments hard to watch.Definitely watch Eng dub if you want a good laugh.Story:I think the premise of the story is very interesting, and I love a good psychological thriller. I found myself wanting to know more about the world and the characters, and what led them there. However, even at the end of the anime, there were more questions that were left unanswered, unfortunately.There were huge plot points I wish they had delved into more, but I imagine the manga does a better job at that.Art:I liked the art! I thought the character design was nice, and it\'s always good to find an anime where they don\'t look straight out of a romance anime (pointy chins, big eyes, etc.) or from your generic, bland anime where all of the characters look the same and have weird baby faces.There were times where the art suffered, and CGI looked a bit silly, but I can look past that as most of the time it looked fine, if not good.Characters:I see most of the reviews talking about how every character is unlikable. I agree with them, but at the same time, I don\'t have any issues watching the show because of it. I actually find it more intriguing to have a main character that acts like a self-entitled brat 90% of the show, but also has some redeeming moments. We all know someone like Kei Kurono, if you weren\'t already like him in your rebellious teen years. I found myself feeling sorry for him throughout the show because of his selfishness, but it was comedic at times. He is a likeable-unlikable asshole in my opinion.I believe some of the characters play on their own cliches- some of them are just so over the top, it\'s like the writers KNOW this, and play it up on purpose - and I think that many chalk it up to bad writing. I chose to look at it in a satirical sense, and I genuinely like the fact the characters can be summed up to their own cliches in some cases, but specifically for this show. For example, one of the characters, a big-chested woman who can\'t fight at all and screams every time her crush does something- it\'s funny! Yet there is depth there, as she is only seen by characters as the sex object, she knows this, but you get glimpses of her thoughts in different scenes. Another example is characters verbally (or mentally) expressing their confusion/concerns with what was happening that were exactly what I was thinking in the scenes. ""what the fuck?!""I don\'t think they expanded on many characters enough, which is a flaw.I wish there was more time spent developing the characters. There is one scene between the main character and an antagonist from their past that is played many times throughout the show, and it would\'ve been better to see other things.Sound:I really, really liked the OP and ED. The music that plays throughout the show is different and fits into the scenes perfectly.The English dub was absolutely hilarious and felt realistic. I would say most, if not all, of the characters have great voice actors that play their parts really well. The swearing, screams, snarky attitudes and casual conversations felt so realistic, I just couldn\'t believe it, and I could NOT stop laughing throughout this show due to characters having such great dialogue and personality when speaking. liked him more.

It was a big deal when it came out, ahead of it's time probably since it had to deal with a lot of censor and bans all over the world. If you were a teenager (like me at the time) you loved the violence and anxiety it gave you, it's was almost as if you were there.(Since this is the first half of the series I'll keep my harsh critic to the second part)If you want to get into the world of Gantz it's ok to watch this first half of the anime, but after that go an...read the manga, the second half does something that should never be done in any adaptation no matter how bad their situation is. read the manga, the second half does something that should never be done in any adaptation no matter how bad their situation is."", 'Gantz was an awsome anime. when I first was going to watch it I wasnt to sure anout it, because my friend told me it was really gory and hardcore.  He made it sounds really wierd. After i watched it it was amazing. The story was good but you really have to pay attention to see it. The characters were good some of them were just wierd and crazy but they were cool.  I enjoyed it a lot. I would recomend this anime to any one that likes action and a main character that gets wood in class...lol ', 'I thought every aspect of it was amazing. The end ruined it for me. The last few episodes sucked. i loved the nudity pushing the boundaries with a horny dog and all the breasts. But then they kill off the love interest and the best friend. @ characters who carried their own story lines and that brought the show down to half as entertaining. Then the crappy ending... It was such a tease and just before delivering the most perfect show they screwed up the end so badly!! It was such a crusher... Your better off not watching it... ', 'What or who is Gantz? The characters never find out, but Gantz certainly takes them on one hell of a ride. The anime is the story of recently deceased people (and a dog) who are taken to a room and ordered to go kill a target that is shown to them. If they succeed, they live, if not, they die (again). The idea is very original and the story itself is very fast moving and will leave you asking ""What\'s going to happen next?"" at the end of each episode. The art and sound of the series is good. The action scenes are exciting and...the colors used are great. Many of the characters are interesting to watch, but there are also some that are a little flat. Luckily, the series fleshes out some of the main characters in flashbacks. The series itself is fast paced and enjoyable to watch. There isn\'t really any big chuck of show that could be considered filler. The only thing that may turn off some viewers is the use of adult language, nudity, and graphic violence. Personally, I didn\'t mind the swearing or violence, but there was definite overuse of anime breasts! It is rated M for a reason. Overall, the series was a blast to watch and it left me wanting more. I would recommend this series to anyone 17+ who enjoys action based anime with a hint of science fiction. the colors used are great.

If you feel i didn\'t go in depth enough, just know this is not indicative of all of my reviews.Pros:Main girl was cute (not hard to do)In the dub, the actors spoke like people in those situations would actually speak. All the swear words flying everywhere because . . Well, the situation kinda calls for it.The general premise was interesting...Cons: (way longer)There was never any point in the entire season that I worried for the safety of any of the characters. Not because there was no stakes. I just didn\'t like any of them. Not a single one.The MC Kei is a perverted good for nothing that has to be put in do or die situations in order to do anything. I cant name a single redeeming quality about him other than he\'s better than the cartoonishly evil villains. Her sexual assault is also played off as titillating alot. I can usually accept and sometimes get behind that at times. Maybe it was the english voice actress or the frequency but It made my uncomfortable every time.The main girl also named Kei (yes its dumb) can\'t do anything on her own. If I had to call a character arc ""the best"" it would be hers but its bland and been done before. She also falls in love with Katou way to easily which decreases her value to me. Like Yoko Litner all over again.Katou has the exact opposite issue Kei has. He is given absolutely no flaws. Picture the most good possible action to take and he will take that action. Its uninteresting. Hes so averse to killing he chooses to almost die than kill a literal robot. And I know the whole scene in the bathroom . . . That was my favorite part in the whole show. Then its portrayed as a bad thing. It was the one time I rooted for him. The one time he wasn\'t Mr. Perfect.Isshi was a character i wanted to die from the very beginning. They tried to give him some sort of depth but I was too excited for him to be gone to care.Everyone else is either cartoonishly evil, or annoyingly helpless. Need conflict? Have some bullies extracting teeth from a dude for no good reason. Its lazy.Tldr: my experience with this show, was mild intrigue at the beginning, and after the halfway point, consisted of hoping for the death of nearly every single character and usually being dissapointed. Female Kei was the closest I came to ""liking"" a character but thats cuz shes cute and not a bad person. She literally has the least reason to live out of anyone though. I have never been kept on the razors edge of dropping a show for so long without actually dropping it (unless you count Naruto) Cons: (way longer)There was never any point in the entire season that I worried for the safety of any of the characters. Not because there was no stakes. I just didn\'t like any of them. Not a single one.The MC Kei is a perverted good for nothing that has to be put in do or die situations in order to do anything. I cant name a single redeeming quality about him other than he\'s better than the cartoonishly evil villains. Her sexual assault is also played off as titillating alot. I can usually accept and sometimes get behind that at times. Maybe it was the english voice actress or the frequency but It made my uncomfortable every time.The main girl also named Kei (yes its dumb) can\'t do anything on her own. If I had to call a character arc ""the best"" it would be hers but its bland and been done before. She also falls in love with Katou way to easily which decreases her value to me.

Gantz exudes a captivating allure that's hard to resist. There's an enigmatic quality to Kurono's character, and the exploration of possibilities and extreme violence ignites a fervent fascination within us.The lore presented in Gantz is among the most inventive I've encountered. It's rich with depth and complexity, adding layers of intrigue to an already compelling narrative.While the art style is generally commendable, there are moments where it appears somewhat haphazard, particularly with the incorporation of 3D models. Nevertheless, the strength of the storytelling compensates for any visual shortcomings.The characters in Gantz are exceptionally human, flawed and nuanced, with some even veering into less-than-likeable territory.It's...regrettable that the anime adaptation only scratches the surface of the manga's expansive storyline. Additionally, the occasional awkwardness of the 3D models can elicit a chuckle. Nonetheless, the core concept and the richness of the characters shine through, making Gantz a truly memorable experience. regrettable that the anime adaptation only scratches the surface of the manga's expansive storyline.

There's a lot of good things, like the fantastic Opening and Ending & some stellar tracks on the OST, the very iconic & peak early 2000s animation style, and the interesting concepts and designs shown off. There's a lot of not so good things though, like a very drag-on pace at certain points, and the very drastic and MUCH for the worse change in the shows plot when they ran out of content due to the manga being unfinished at the time of airing. (Similar to what had happened with the original Fullmetal Alchemist).Overall, I would say...I love this show, but I quite literally have not watched the last episode because of how bad the show was getting after the final arc of the manga finishes and the show is forced to drag itself onward on its own with poorly established characters that only exist in the anime for this express purpose. I basically half recommend this anime alongside a strong urging that whomever might decide to check it out should also give  the manga a shot. After having my younger brother originally suggest & check out some of this show with me, it made me end up reading the manga and I fell in love with both the crazy story and the exquisite artwork. The manga gets a bit wild but I love it and the overall story is far better, it is definitely worth a read if you enjoyed this as it has become one of my all time favorite manga after finding it through this show.

I don\'t know the manga of this work, so I could only get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe anime. I have also heard that the anime is not following the manga.This should be said before I get to the actual evaluation of this ... ""work"".Let\'s get to the plot first. The basic idea of \u200b\u200bhunting for death, cloning and all the trimmings is quite interesting. Even towards the end of the series, some tension was built up due to the fresher episodes.But apart from that, the whole story has received little information from anything. And the episodes were practically unsettling....Every now and then a character ran to one spot for almost 2 minutes. Or they just stared or screamed at each other for around 60 seconds just to get to the episode time. The series followed no logic. According to my previous assessment, I have never seen an anime in about 12 years in which the scenes rotated in a circle and were drawn in such a way. It\'s like chewing gum for weeks. There were actually some episodes that only presented one scene for 20 minutes. And in the context of this scene, everyone just stood around and stared at each other like confused bricks.Animations ... in 2004 you were used to better things, even years before. This is a mix of .. cheap CGI? And grotesquely bad animations. The characters run as if they were sliding. The jumps are almost amusing. And the whole area is full of CGI, even the garbage cans and the floor. But with the animations of the nude portrayals, they reached directly into the budget.Characters ...I have rarely seen such a collection of ... stupid, ignorant and hateful creatures. Only at the end did some intelligent characters finally appear and the protagonist also learned to use his brain cells. Previously, the average IQ was around 10.None of them were able to conduct even the simplest of dialogues, they couldn\'t even enlighten each other.  And that was just one of the examples. As if you had put a drunken intern on the typewriter.Apart from that, almost all of them have been incredibly unappealing. One was worse than the other. There were only a handful of average characters. Otherwise there was the protagonist ""kurono"". By far the biggest thorn in the whole anime. Selfish, greedy, envious, cowardly, haughty, weak, perverse, horny and constantly on the go with erection or sexual fantasies. And around 90% of the plant.And then the music ..Apart from terrible intro and outro, which I couldn\'t even attribute a point to. We have the soundtracks. There were a few ... at least average tones to be heard here. What\'s worst about it is the lack of professionalism. The soundtracks have always been louder than the actual dialogues. If I had no subtitles and would speak Japanese, I would have understood almost no word. The voices c.a. 30% and the music 70% completely dominated the scenes.In the end, the plot has potential and the last 4-5 episodes are better than the rest of the series. On the whole, ""Gantz"" is probably one of the poorest quality works of all time. Equal to a Bollywood film Every now and then a character ran to one spot for almost 2 minutes.

The edgelord of animes, it flaunts suicide and rape along with copious amounts of gore for no reason other than meaningless shock value. It is pure torture to watch, as every sentence spoken by every character fills the viewer with unpleasant feelings that cannot be described in words, like a slap to the face of humanity. The only positive thing about this anime is the intro song, Super Shooter, which is actually straight fire, and the sole reason I gave this anime one point above rock bottom.Story: 1/10Titles like Elfen Lied, Mahoutsukai no Yome, and many others use edge effectively to...deepen attachment to characters and give meaning to a story. Gantz uses edge to be edgy. There's absolutely no point to any of the suicide or rape scenes, and they more or less get forgotten immediately after they happen. There's no real plot, either; nothing ever happens that's important relative to anything else that has happened or will happen. For an anime with no plot and disgraceful edge, no more than 1 point is merited.Art: 3/10The art is about as low-quality as you'd expect from something made in the early 2000's, but that might be a blessing in disguise as it blurs the CGI cuts to look less conspicuous.Sound: 7/10Like I said, the opening is a banger. It's so good, actually, that even if the rest of the soundtrack was composed by a toddler banging around the kitchen cabinet, I'd still have to give the sound a passing score.Character: 1/10Somehow, this aspect is even worse than the story. Every character in this anime is either mind-blowingly stupid, aneurysm-inducingly douchey, or both. Actually, there are only two characters who aren't both, but even as just one or the other they're still absolutely insufferable. Think of the most intolerable asshole of a character you've ever seen in anime, knock his IQ down about 50 points, and you've got the protagonist of Gantz. There are only two characters that are less of an asshole than him; one is the token female whose sole purpose of existence is to provide suicide and rape scenes, and the other is his best bud who's pure at heart but so stupid he wouldn't be able to solve a 1x1 Rubik's cube.Enjoyment: 1/10As I said in the synopsis, watching this anime was pure psychological torture.

The dialogue between them makes you want to shoot yourself... skip this anime is not worth it.', 'This review is only about the anime since I haven\'t read the manga.The events begin in an apartment in Tokyo. A group of people who don\'t know each other(mostly) find themselves in an apartment with locked doors and windows one evening, and as you can imagine, they have no idea how they got there. Apart from a group of confused people, there is one more important thing in the room: a giant black orb that is called Gantz. Apparently, Gantz has lots of information about the people in the room but it refuses to give information about what is going on and instead, it gives...some instructions with a sarcastic language. Then we learn from a kid who knows more than the other people in the room that Gantz somehow found the people who lost their lives that night and teleported them to this mysterious room. This is not an act of kindness tho, of course. Gantz\'s goal is to get these people to fight in its own special game. There are aliens that need to be destroyed, and Gantz provides special protective suits and weapons for everyone in the room. If they fight, kill and reach 100 points, they will be able to escape this game of Gantz and get back to their lives.Now, first of all, at first glance, I can\'t say that the story is very interesting, at least in concept, but it is certainly interesting enough because there is a lot of unknown. Even just from the first episode of the anime, I had a lot of questions in my head. Like what exactly is Gantz? How does this whole game, teleporting people, special weapons and clothes, people who lose their ""authenticity"" when they die work? Yes, I know that the Gantz anime is split into two seasons. So I didn\'t think I would get all the answers from the first season. But it\'s pretty obvious that I won\'t get them from the second season either. I need to read the manga for this, but the bad things the Gantz\'s anime does are enough to make me lose interest in the series.So what are these bad things? First and foremost, pacing. I can\'t stand that they ruin something interesting on paper by setting the pacing so badly. Yes, Gantz is interesting as a concept, but it is just as bad and boring due to this. Second, the characters. The characters are absolute disgraces. Let me summarize our main trio. One of them is a dishonest, malicious, perverted jerk. The other is the classic tall, big, so-called good boy who has pure feelings inside, but can be dazed because of it. Finally, a frustrating girl with weak character and dependent on others, who was put into the series to show sexual elements and a pair of big tits, but with no other character and personality. Almost all of the side characters, on the other hand, are the types that can be called the garbage of the society, who talk and act in the dumbest way possible and mostly die this way. Because I guess it takes a few NPCs for a story like this. You know that character portrait in slasher horror movies that\'s only written to piss you off because it gives you a kind of relief and happiness when you see them die? Other characters are mostly like that.In terms of brutality and gore, Gantz is actually pretty good, it might even be the best among the animes I\'ve watched. But nudity? Now that\'s another topic. What exactly is the purpose of the sexual elements in this series? Okay, you just designed a character to be a sexual object. Again okay, you\'ve also stressed enough that one of the main characters is a perverted jerk. But why do you always show us a pair of breasts for no meaningful reason? Why do most of the male character population in the anime try to rape the girl and almost all of them are molesters? I don\'t even want to talk about the dog.There is one last disgraceful aspect that I should mention. Dialogues and general behavior of the characters. I consider these two elements as a whole. With respect, mangaka must be thinking he is Steinbeck, but someone needs to tell him. As if the things that come out of the characters\' mouths are very meaningful, these and meaningless actions of them cover the majority of what we watch. The same and repetitive dumb and meaningless dialogues, the characters keeping the same dumb personalities without any improvement in 13 episodes, endless waits for an obvious decision... You can pick your favourite out of all this bullshit, Gantz has it all and more.Good idea, very bad implementation. That\'s the gist of Gantz. I won\'t be watching the second season. Because it\'s made as a whole so it probably has just a few different kinds of aliens, but nothing more than a continuation of the same bullshit. I don\'t think I\'ll read the manga either, because it\'s a lengthy manga and I don\'t have the patience to go through this bad shit just to find answers to few questions. some instructions with a sarcastic language.

After watching Gantz, I can see why. Social commentaries are always welcome, even average, uninteresting and unoriginal ones. But this isn’t a social commentary. It’s blatant angst. Someone said it’s shallow. That is exactly right. It would be right at home in r/im14andthisisdeep or something along those lines. Very whiny, very self-centred.The only acceptable character is the male model, and even so he would be considered a weak and forgettable character in any other series. But at least his decisions don’t boggle the mind.The only aspect of the show that makes me curious to want...to know more is ironically the aliens. I’d rather know their origins, etc. rather than those of the humans.Everything else is terrible. I’ve always wondered why people are so anti-CG. After watching Gantz, I now know why. If this is the type of CG that anti-CG folks have been exposed to, it makes perfect sense.The clumsy, awkward and frankly horrible pacing is the reason people give up on anime and turn to manga.And these are just the most glaring flaws. When I first started out, I realised there were many issues, but even those pale in comparison to the ones mentioned above. Gantz will have its fanbase, for sure, as every series does, but do yourself a favour and read through at least a few negative reviews before deciding on whether this is something you’d be fine with. I’ve never seen so many accurate negative reviews for a series before. to know more is ironically the aliens. I’d rather know their origins, etc. rather than those of the humans.Everything else is terrible. I’ve always wondered why people are so anti-CG. After watching Gantz, I now know why. If this is the type of CG that anti-CG folks have been exposed to, it makes perfect sense.The clumsy, awkward and frankly horrible pacing is the reason people give up on anime and turn to manga.And these are just the most glaring flaws. When I first started out, I realised there were many issues, but even those pale in comparison to the ones mentioned above.

I filed it away in my mind to re-investigate it at some point. 20 years later, I watch the anime, and I'm quite dissaappointed.Gantz, is a really poorly-paced, poorly- written, homophobic slew of trash. The editing is very bad. It does however, have some excellent concepts, and provides a decent backstory for the main characters and their development. The way the music used is also really neat (It sounds weird like different things being mixed together at times)ITs too bad because it feels like a wasted opportunity to explore...what was actually a really cool idea... Of dipping into some sidderral universe and go after evil entities and earn Reincarnation points. Also some interseting technology, lore and other things. Buit no exposition on any of those things takes place, instead what we have is something that has very little meat and a nice skeleton that is padded with a lot of filer and suspenseful scenes where people refuse/afraid to shoot guns so it adds to the tension... kinda a dumb gimmick if you ask me.Not sure if I'll give the second season a chance or not, I like the premise, but this really feels like the line for me when anime in 2000s started to take a dip with all the isekai crap. what was actually a really cool idea...

Kei, a rapey whining character with no real redeeming qualities.Especially the English dub, his voice and behavior make me want to shove icepicks in my eyes and ears. I've never seen an anime with such high quality get destroyed by a single main character.How this show gets such hype around it is something I can't comprehend. When every time a dumpster fire of a character opens his mouth.This show is so bad, I'm writing my first anime review ever for it. To put that into perspective, I've watched well over 400 different series...and sequels.So summarize:Graphics - 8/10Music/Sound - 8/10Concept - 8/10Writing - 7/10Character - 0/10 (they kill pretty much everyone except the worst character in the show)Don't believe the hype. and sequels.So summarize:Graphics - 8/10Music/Sound - 8/10Concept - 8/10Writing - 7/10Character - 0/10 (they kill pretty much everyone except the worst character in the show)Don't believe the hype."", 'Slade\'s Quick ReviewGantz scarred me as a kid. I binged it after school for 2 days and it threw me into a weird haze for weeks later. This is definitely not for the feint of heart, its got some gore to it, but its more of the physiological part of the characters deaths that make you uncomfortable. It shows nudity but not in the typical fan service way, more of a disturbing connection between violence and sexuality. Its garbage animation adds to it and makes its dark vibe more coherent in that its ""not right"". No character is safe in this show and I truly...love that, but its not like they randomly kill people you straight up know they are dying before it happens it draws out deaths which other anime are scared to do. love that, but its not like they randomly kill people you straight up know they are dying before it happens it draws out deaths which other anime are scared to do.']"
