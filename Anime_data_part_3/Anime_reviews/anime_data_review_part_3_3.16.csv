Pokemon Movie 05: Mizu no Miyako no Mamorigami Latias to Latios,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1120/Pokemon_Movie_05__Mizu_no_Miyako_no_Mamorigami_Latias_to_Latios,"['This is one of my favourite movie of the Poke series.I just love the story, the music, the art. The storyline is very nice written, the characters are ofc what we are used to :) I prefer the ""older"" pokemon storyline, and i think this was the last one which made me whatch it without going away from it in the middle. ', ""POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT (Summary & thought: Good movie):I think this is a pretty good one, although the ending is kind of expected. I like this pair of legendary pokemons and I personally like Latios more than Latias. I love the way he protects his sister. Moreover, this pair of pokemons are really loyal to the city. They will sacrifice themselves to protect the city and it's really beautiful to see this kind of loyalty. And it's kind of sad too because it somehow makes me feel that they were born to protect the city. =( "", 'Pokémon Heroes: Latios and Latias is a strange movie. Unlike the older movies which intertwined the story and characters, this movie (un)intentionally separates the two into their mostly self-contained scenes. Thus, when talking about why this movie is good, we\'re practically talking about a completely different movie than the one we have in mind while discussing the bad.Lets get the bad over with first. Continuing the now grand tradition of rushed and poorly thought out plots, here we have a machine which lacks any real gounding in the real world and is bound only by the power of plot necessity. There are two big questions...which arise from watching the movie - How did ancients build a mech-pod with a VR interface and magic cameras all over the city? How do infinite prison bars materialize all over the city? Both of these are answered with the power of Latios and Latias, of course. It just isn\'t tought out, at all.On the brighter side of things, the town looks lovely and Venice, the city this movie was modeled on, can only wish to be this beautiful. Locations in this movie are amazingly detailed and ooze with atmosphere, arguably more so than any Pokemon movie since. Coupled with a really great soundtrack to complement it, the movie becomes an unforgetable cozy experience. As a stand out song, I have to mention ""Mistery Girl, Again"", a great example of music being synced with a scene in an intricate way.Since the plot is paper thin, the movie has to rely on something beyond the drive towards a distinct goal. While some later movies utilized daily life in Ash\'s journey to pad out the running time, this one embraces that reality and shapes itself into a bunch of slice of life scenes which slowly turn the movie into a character relationship piece.After we\'re treated to an engaging and visually creative opening through a pokemon race, the movie lets us soak in the atmosphere of the city for a few minutes. Not overstaying its welcome, we\'re soon introduced to a mute girl, Latias in disguise. After a few fun adventures, Ash finds himself in direct contact with two siblings, Latios & Latias.What makes the movie tick are the regular interactions between Ash, Latias and Latios. Unlike questionable relationships Ash had with others in previous and will have in future movies, you can really feel the connection between them here.Eventually a duo of thieves steal the Soul Dew, a jewl which grants its wielder control of the city\'s defense systems. This leads to a tragic situation. While the aformentioned machine is a lazy plot McGuffin, it\'s used to steer character interactions into an arc and give them a sense of purpose. While certainly a thorn in the side of this movie, it doesn\'t detract from the overall experience much.At the very end of the movie, we get to witness Ash\'s first kiss. Latias in her human form thanks him for everything he\'s done for her, cementing this as the weirdest Pokemon movie yet.Guardian Gods of the Capital of Water: Latias and Latios is a comfy cartoon about a special day in Ash\'s life. Its B plot is kind of a mistake in itself, but is easily glanced over. Beyond that, the movie is an extremely enjoyable experience in the vein of Aria. I doubt we\'ll get something like it ever again, so even if it ain\'t the greatest thing since baked bread, it should still be cherished as one of the best Pokemon episodes. which arise from watching the movie - How did ancients build a mech-pod with a VR interface and magic cameras all over the city?

An okay Pokémon movie, altogether. movie left me wanting for more. An okay Pokémon movie, altogether."", ""Of all the movies with the original trio, this is the one I never remember for some reason, and I'm really not sure why. It's not a bad movie. Maybe not one of Pokémon's best, but still perfectly enjoyable.There are some low points. The villains aren't at all memorable. Team Rocket is there just to be there. Even Misty and Brock are there just to be there in this one. (Seriously, I don't think there's any other movie where they do less.) Even Ash doesn't really learn or grow in any meaningful way. It felt like a typical showcase movie-- introducing kids to the...new legendaries. But none of this was really off-putting to me. (The only thing I truly disliked was the screeching sound Latias and Latios make to communicate; was ready to mute that before the movie was half over...)But what really stuck out to me was the visuals. Maybe it was just the design of the town, but everything in this movie looked beautiful. So yeah, maybe not the best Pokemon movie out there, but it didn't get on my nerves in any major way, so I'd say it's served its purpose. new legendaries.

Sure the graphics weren't that good at the time but the story of latias and latios working together with ash and their strong bond was enough to get me hooked. If i re watched this movie i probably will be singing a different tune but for now this is my song.In my eyes its also a classic to me...since it is from my childhood memories. It is also a classic because it's got the basics of any great anime movie, The bad guy(s), the good guy(s) and their goal to protect something or someone. So i feel if you want to have an enjoyable time i recommend you watch this anime movie because it is worth your time. since it is from my childhood memories.

This signaled that what you thought was only Pokemon times two, was now Pokemon times THREE. This was a very important shift for myself and many other fans, initiating the tradition of featuring the upcoming generation\'s legendary Pokemon in the movies of the current one. Additionally, it was the last movie to feature Ash\'s original hat and outfit, and Misty! It\'s significance is realized by it\'s solid, ambitious animation and formulaic fulfillment,...with a fat portion of nostalgia.Pokemon movies of this era looked fantastic, and Heroes is no exception. Due in no small part to this being the last movie featuring Ash\'s original outfit, it resembles classic Pokemon much more strongly than modern. The key character animation is crisp, and the color palettes really pop. The CG is this movie is much more ambitious, well executed, and pervasive than its predecessors. It\'s used for everything from crowds, flying the camera through environments, water, and intricate objects and set pieces that wouldn\'t have been feasible to hand draw. Not all of the textures are so great, and a few times it looks like a GameCube game, but I\'m overall very impressed at how well it was incorporated for 2003. After a quick Bulbapedia check, it appears the Pokemon movies weren\'t animated digitally until a few movies after this one, making the depth of CG incorporation that much more impressive.The score is excellent and evocative; even the music in the reused opening scene from the last movie instantly made me well up inside. The inclusion of the Pokemon: Master Quest theme song immediately got me pumped and into the action, because it\'s one of my favorite openings after the iconic first one. The dub is just great. The main cast brings out tons of nostalgia in me, and the movie characters have a similar feel to how every voice in the 4Kids dub was directed. Latios and Latias are either going to be hilarious or grating to your ears. Their near ceaseless, high pitched wailing leaves me wondering if the actor\'s performance was pitch shifted digitally, but I find much more amusement in imagining that someone was paid to scream through their nose for hours.You should already know what to expect for the characters. Ash, Brock, Misty, and Team Rocket have been the same for nearly two decades. As for the movie characters, I would say they\'re bland at best. The Team Rocket ""Dirty Pair"" as I call them are the type to pull off a heist and revel in their success, without much more depth. The girl and grandfather who are friends to the legendary duo aren\'t terribly well developed either, but have at least some sympathetic qualities. I did find myself a bit dumbfounded by the depth of Ash\'s stupidity in one sequence, where he helps a silent girl escape from her pursuers. She runs away from him once they\'re safe, so what\'s the only logical course of action to take the next time you see this girl? Chase after her, of course! Poor Ash, you should really just stick to battling.As always, the story revolves around Ash and company encountering the featured legendary Pokemon. I tried to recount the plot in my head afterwards, and all I could come up with is that the Dirty Pair tries to steal a magical item that keeps Venice Island... Wet? Like most Pokemon movies, it\'s not super important. The ending probably would have had a bigger emotional impact on me if I had seen it as a kid, but as it is, I suppose it\'s pretty touching.Who should watch Pokemon Heroes? I would recommend it to any Pokemon fan, unless you we\'re never enthused by generations two or three. It could also be worth the watch if you\'re intrigued by the progression and utilization of CG in anime like I am, but otherwise this is nothing more than a pretty commercial. with a fat portion of nostalgia.Pokemon movies of this era looked fantastic, and Heroes is no exception.

I'd also like to state that my review is over the American release of the film, more specifically the version that comes in the Miramax Pokemon Collector's Set. So if there's any scenes that were cut out that would have affected the score, they won't be counted here.Story: This one actually surprised me in a lot of ways. For starters, the movie doesn't start or introduce Ash with another Pokemon battle, like the previous 4 films did. Instead, it's a Pokemon race, which could still be considered a battle,...but it's at least trying to be different, and I applaud that. It also deals with legit death. I'm not kidding. A character does die by the time the movie is finished. There's none of that tears of life stuff from the first movie or the time travelling screw up from the fourth. This character stays dead. However, there is one thing that I just don't understand. They keep this gigantic machine that's only purpose is to bring back two terrible Pokemon and then destroy the city. It can only be powered by the mystical Soul Dew and the power of Latios. Why do they keep this machine around? It's not like the Soul Dew is in some top secret place that absolutely no one knows exists...Ok it kinda is, but a few people do know where this is, so it's not hidden that well. As for requiring the power of Latios, if the previous 4 movies have taught us anything, it's that legendary Pokemon aren't exactly the hardest to corrupt (see the first movie or 4Ever) or capture (see 2000 or 4Ever). So yeah. They basically have the one machine that can completely wipe their town off the face of the planet in plain sight and no one seems to care.Art: The artwork is extremely good for the movie, almost too good. By that, I mean that there's times where the characters don't really mix well with the surroundings and seem more like someone taped cartoon characters onto a painting at a museum. However, those moments are far and few between since there's a lot of first-person shots where you can admire just how much work was put into designing this city.Sound: This is most likely the lowest score for the movie. There's not a whole lot of memorable tracks, besides the opening Master Quest theme. The rest, while works wonderfully for the movie, aren't memorable after you've finished watching them. As for the dubb's voice acting, it's good, but not great. It's far better than the voice acting from previous films in the series, but still isn't anything note-worthy.Character: Aside from Ash, Misty, and Brock, the other characters are enjoyable. I really liked how the legendaries for this film came in a pair and weren't always seen fighting (First Movie and 2000) or were only seen together when the plot required they be together (4Ever). They actually spend just about every moment together either playing or Latios being extremely protective over Latias, which I love. Just another thing that separates this film from the previous 4. Because of this, the two become really likable and I ended up caring more for both of them than I did for any previous legendary (I'm not counting Entei because, at the time I'm writing this, I have yet to see the third movie). However, Latios and Latias are really the only interesting characters here. The villains are just more Team Rocket members, so, as seen with 4Ever, they don't require any reason to be doing what they're doing. Then you have Bianca and her grandfather, Lorenzo, who really only spout out exposition most of the time.Enjoyment: After watching the First Movie and 4Ever, this was extremely entertaining. While there were a few things that bugged me, they didn't get too much in the way of my overall enjoyment of the film. but it's at least trying to be different, and I applaud that.

Things really picked up after that, and it stayed engaging until the end.There was some nice bits of humor throughout the movie, and nice action. Latias was sort of annoying, however.But then there's the animation...yipes. The animation in this movie was OUTSTANDING. Pretty much every scene in the movie looked lovely, and the scenery and atmosphere of Alto Mare was captured beautifully. In fact, a good argument could be made that this has the...best animation in the series. And once again, the climactic scene was amazingly well-done.Once again, a good movie and one i'd recommend to any fan. best animation in the series.

Now as a grown adult, I have truly grasped and understood the beauty and wonders this movie depicts.As per usual, Pokemon loves using 'Legendary Pokemon' within their storylines because that's what captures a viewers attention (and I'm one of them).This review may lack some authenticity only because I currently do not have the time to watch all the other Pokemon movies. But I seriously wanted to write this review due to having past experiences from this movie. It is extremely nostalgic for me...but honestly, the vibes I get from this movie is a lot more different than the other Pokemon movies I've watched. It's unbelievably heart-warming.

For instance, *SPOILER* when Latios was desperate to save Latias over the villains and ensure she could escape capture safely. And *MAJOR SPOILER* Latios passing away really got to me...(Latios had way too little screen time and he's the MOST courageous, loving, big boi I've ever seen in Pokemon so far).This is just me (and being an extremely sensitive being). Please don't base your understanding and emotions on just me but view and feel how you wish! No right or wrong when watching something.Overall, I would say give it a go. Nothing to lose. I do want this movie to get a bit more credit, hence why I am writing this too.As for me, I will most definitely say I will rewatch again and again until death do me apart. but honestly, the vibes I get from this movie is a lot more different than the other Pokemon movies I've watched.

It's a shame because it often results in a flat movie that fails to emotionally connect, constrained by its limitations. However, this 5th film, centered around Pokémon Latias and Latios, felt different from the previous ones. It managed to explore its ideas more deeply. Although, in my opinion, some parts were rushed, such as the...moment when [Spoiler Start] Latios is captured, and Ash, Latias, and Pikachu rush to the Museum to save him. I found it ridiculous how easily Ash eliminated one of the two antagonists with a simple Pikachu attack, then rescued the other two. I was worried because I thought the film would end there, but the story continued, and I found the end of the film beautiful and meaningful. It revealed that the sphere at the center of the entire story was, in fact, the remaining soul of Latios and Latias' father! [Spoiler End]I found this part too simplistic and rushed, but everything else seemed to progress at a good pace. The film is only 1 hour and 9 minutes long, which is short, but it was enough for me to complete its story!The film's quality is evident; in each of these films, Pokémon has tried new things, including 3D. It's not surprising that they attempted 3D; after all, this film dates back to 2002, a time when experimenting with 3D was a trend. The 4th film based on Celebi was quite clumsy in this regard, trying to be too ahead of its time, and the 3D, in my opinion, detracted from the film. However, they learned from their mistakes. In this film, the 3D is subtle, not trying to be too futuristic, enhancing the moments when it appears without overdoing it! moment when [Spoiler Start] Latios is captured, and Ash, Latias, and Pikachu rush to the Museum to save him.

The 4th film based on Celebi was quite clumsy in this regard, trying to be too ahead of its time, and the 3D, in my opinion, detracted from the film. However, they learned from their mistakes. In this film, the 3D is subtle, not trying to be too futuristic, enhancing the moments when it appears without overdoing it!"", 'This is definitely my favorite Pokémon movie. The storyline is interesting. Ash, Misty, and Brock are in the city of Alto Mare, which seems to be heavily inspired by the city of Venice, Italy. Very cool. The guardians of the city are the Pokémon Latios and Latias, who Ash later meets and befriends. Little do they know, Team Rocket duo Annie and Oakly are also in Alto Mare with evil intention. They want to capture Latios and Latias and use their power to take control of a machine known as the Defense Mechanism of Alto Mare. This movie has interesting story and good characters. Latios...and Latias have become my favorite Pokémon and they have been for a long time. This Pokémon Movie has also been my favorite. and Latias have become my favorite Pokémon and they have been for a long time. This Pokémon Movie has also been my favorite.']"
Neppuu Kairiku Bushi Road,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19653/Neppuu_Kairiku_Bushi_Road,"['((May contain some spoilers!))I honestly had fun watching this series. Yes I agree the series could have been better if it were longer, but it wasn\'t bad either. If you enjoy some action with a taste of romance, then you might like Neppuu Kairiku Bushi Road.Story - 7/10The story itself was intriguing. The poison called ""Shinobi"" which are attacking the human race is what caught my attention to this series. Although it was a unique plot, at times the story felt rushed. It especially felt rushed when you could tell where scenes were cut to make the movie shorter. Things escalated quite quickly towards the...end of the series, causing a bit of confusion for the viewer. The ending, I surprisingly liked. I hope to see more of this series in the future, mainly because I want to see more of what Neppuu Kairiku Bushi Road could really be.Art - 8/10One thing that drew my attention to Neppuu Kairiku Bushi Road was its art. The animation and character designs are both good, no faults there.Character - 4/10Although I adored Suou and his relationship with Ame, I do feel as though the characters could have had better development. Again, if the story were to become an anime or more to the series was added, I would hope to see more character development. Suou wanted to grow stronger in order to protect Ame however, I felt as though this character development fell a bit short. Neither Suou nor Ame\'s character seemed to grow, except towards the very end where Ame realized what she had caused for everyone. If you are not bothered by no character development, then still watch this series. The interaction between the main characters and the characters themselves were still enjoyable and made up a little for the lack of development.Enjoyment 7-6/10The movie did not bore me in the beginning and though I hate to say it, the ending was less exciting for me. I enjoyed the bits of action the show carried out, however, the second half of the series seemed rushed. I had also hoped to see more epic fight scenes than what I saw. The scenes between Ame and Suou were also quite enjoyable and gave the series a warmer feeling.Overall - 6Neppuu Kairiku Bushi Road was not a bad show, however, it could have been so much more. With this being said, if you are bored and are looking for something to watch, then feel free to watch it. The show is neither good nor bad, it sits somewhere in between, but nonetheless is still an entertaining movie. end of the series, causing a bit of confusion for the viewer.

And all endings which are just that, ENDINGS, deserve praise. So points where points are due.Other than that this is a one and a half hour long episode of any generic sci-fi post apocalyptic shounen anime.It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it pulls of what it aims to pull of;nothing special at all.There was some cringe:ing. but I don't hate myself for watching it. However i don't really think it was worth the time spent.Not something I would recommend, to anyone really, but I guess some people potentialy could enjoy it....If you REALLY like shounen shows, consider watching. If you REALLY like shounen shows, consider watching."", ""[Note: there are some minor spoilers contained in this review, but none that aren't already glaringly obvious as one watches this special. I've marked it so you know where to skip if you want absolutely no spoilers.]For some parts, Neppu Kairiku Bushi Road can be considered a decent series. But at the end of the 90 minutes, I came away with the feeling that it was a work where much potential went to waste.Let's start with what makes it potentially a great series. Bushi Road is set in a world where humanity, while warring amongst themselves, was threatened by monsters called the shinobi. Princess Ame,...the main character, lost her country to a massive shinobi invasion. Along her journey, she met Suou, who descended from an ancient lineage known for its exceptional combat abilities. She then decided to find and revive Giga Lord, a lost ancient mecha, to destroy the shinobi once and for all. So far, nothing special. However, given that there are a lot of good ideas that can be explored (for instance, a lost continent that remains mostly untouched), Bushi Road holds a lot of promises. Not to mention that the setting of samurai-era mannerism mixed in with modern mecha combat (complete with flying castles) makes it pretty entertaining to watch.But as you can expect from my opening, things also went downhill from the beginning. First, it's not difficult to tell that a lot of things were cut out just to save time. In fact, this special adopts a method whereby it cuts off right at certain scenes, shows the aftermath, and uses brief flashbacks to fill up the missing parts. This method isn't an issue in and of itself. However, the number of times it's used makes it clear the director is basically attempting to cut as much time as possible just to fit the 90-minute mark. And it takes away significantly from the immersion experience because as a viewer you constantly get lost as to what happened and end up looking for explanations that aren't there.Second, the character development not surprisingly becomes an utter trainwreck. [Here is where some minor spoilers are.] Near the beginning, Ame had her key to the Giga Lord (an inheritance from her mother) taken away from her. At that time, the person who took it from her asked her whether she had the resolve to protect her people. Later on, to no one's surprise, she gets it back. Presumably, she should've already matured from the events that took place in between. But no, when she came across the shinobi again, she went on full revenge rampage mode again, as if she basically remained as she was at the beginning of this 90-minute special. [This is where spoilers end.] Throughout the entire special, neither Ame nor Suou seemed to have grown. That would've been fine if character growth wasn't necessary. But it was, at least where Ame was concerned. Under these circumstances, it's hard to feel for the two because the viewer ends up seeing them as essentially static entities. Perhaps even peculiar ones, since change should've taken place.Moreover, there are just so many plot holes in this special it's hard to justify a lot of what happened. The final sequence in particular came off as being pretty nonsensical. In all honesty, I simply don't think that Bushi Road worthwhile given the flaws that it has. Sure, the animation quality is decent, and so is the soundtrack, but at the end of the day, the plot and the characters simply fall short of what one might have expected, as charming as the interaction between Ame and Suou has been at times. If you have extra time to kill on your hands, be my guest. But if you're looking for quality work, I don't think Bushi Road is one. Maybe it could've been if it was serialized, but this special pretty much killed the chances of that as well. A shame, really. the main character, lost her country to a massive shinobi invasion.

I will not write any spoilers even though I think that it would be useful to defend my point.Story- 2The story had a nice introduction for what is essentially a 90 min movie.  It sets up a world full of potential and gets the introduction across without too many questions and fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, that\'s all I have good to say about the story as it goes downhill from there.  From what I have read before, people usually lump this in with character (and I\'ll do...that too), but the interactions between characters was detrimental to the plot.  There is no real meaning behind the words they speak because of poor development and therefore a lack of motivation/ reason for their actions.  Another thing wrong were flashbacks that added nothing to the story because they could have been done at the time of the event.  It seemed like a way to shave that extra minute off.  The only reason this got a 2 was because of the potential this story had.Art- 9Actually the only thing I really enjoyed.  Animation was smooth and really captured the scenes well.  To be honest, I couldn\'t really find anything I didn\'t like so I had to give it a 9.Sound- 8I\'m not a sound guru and as long as it goes with what is happening I\'m happy.  Nothing spectacular here but a solid performance nonetheless.Character- 5This was hard to judge because of the limited time, but it had to be mediocre.  As I said before, there was little to no development of the characters.  I finished watching without really caring what happened either way.  Might I have push for the ""good guy"" to win? yeah, but I didn\'t necessarily want the main characters to win.  With that said, there is a spark of personality in them that comes out every once in a while to showcase that this had potential, but that\'s really all it was.  Also the romance part was just ridiculous and either more depth or needed to be taken completely out.  I vote for the removal because I think it would make a better story, but that\'s beside the point.Enjoyment- 5It was fairly enjoyable up until the end for me.  I am biased on the fact that I hold the story (and above all the end) to be the make or break of a show.  I was willing to block out all of the shortcomings, but the ending amplified the weaknesses of this anime and let a lot of the enjoyment that had built up to be squandered.  I still give it a 5 because for 60/90 minutes I enjoyed it.Overall- 3This is actually the first time giving a 3 and I was quite surprised.  For me, Art and sound don\'t play much into the overall score, so based on story, characters, and enjoyment were the real deciding factors.

Lets get on with the review shall we?Plot wise it was surprisingly good, the originality was there in some ways or another, although it was kinda short for only an hour and a half, it feels like the transition was very rushed but it was well put, there should be some scenes that should have been there, or made, but it was not for example the scenes when the two castles collide and a horde of monsters came crashing down while the mc is gone...berserk they could have made that part even more dramatic but instead it was cut (uhhh why would you cut such important climax of the movie? And only give us a small clip to base our own imagination? Damn you!), Btw I\'m just sayin\'. So far so good except for the last part! (Ohh here comes the MAJOR SPOILER!) Why japanese anime people why!!!?? Why must you always! Always! let the Herione die!! I don\'t understand your logic on how a hero should be, but always, always when you create anime like this the male mc always ends up the only one to survive and the female mc is gone dead kaput! Op mc = Female dead that is how japanese creators see it, well, not in my book people! You can\'t call that a hero, for a hero must die protecting! yeah that\'s what its supposed to be. Actually you can\'t be called a hero if you don\'t die! Jk!. What is the use of such OP Strength? The hell?? Why can\'t it be like Superman! Lois Lane is lucky to have him. Shit i wish Superman was there to save the day. Okay enough rambling. Time for the score people! As for the plot i give it a 7.

I mean it\'s good but it\'s not that good, know what i mean? What i mean is vivid cocolors and smosmosmooooth animation quality. For that, i\'m a generous person so i give it a 7/10.Music well the End song was uhhh. How do i describe it, i felt old. Yeah that\'s how i felt. I feel like i was living in the 70\'s or 60\'s eventhough i was born in the 90\'s it was so old and dry no punch or heavyness nor softness, it\'s like a drift wood.

The pacing, the story, any possible character development, all of this is very rushed, which is a shame, because there is serious potential. The setting is interesting, the characters, while mostly flat, possess a glimmering hint of depth, the animation is well done and the soundtrack is very enjoyable.The problem, however, is that Bushi Road is only 90 minutes long. Which means that essentially it's the Spark Notes version of what could have been a great anime. If you gave the setting and characters 24 episodes to do their thing, this could have been amazing,...but as it stands, with only 90 minutes the character arcs are very confusing (with some of them vowing to be together forever after having met each other about five minutes ago) or are practically nonexistent. The setting is never explored and only serves to provide well illustrated but otherwise shallow backdrops with no context, characters are introduced and simply discarded, and the entire thing is a shining example of something that should have been a series as opposed to an OVA.Good points, however, is that the action sequences, though few in number, are beautifully animated. The computer imagery for the Shinobi and the mechs look fantastic, and as mentioned previously the soundtrack is really quite engrossing.Overall, Bushi Road is little more than a popcorn flick to watch in your spare time. It's shiny in some parts with a bit of spectacle but many viewers will come away from it confused and dissatisfied, and will have forgotten what it was about in a week. but as it stands, with only 90 minutes the character arcs are very confusing (with some of them vowing to be together forever after having met each other about five minutes ago) or are practically nonexistent.

Precure All Stars Movie New Stage 2: Kokoro no Tomodachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16442/Precure_All_Stars_Movie_New_Stage_2__Kokoro_no_Tomodachi,"[""Ah the Precure crossover movies. A yearly tradition that can vary from fun to just annoying. But how does New Stage 2 hold up? Well it's a much better than I thought it would be, though it did suffer from a lot of problems that come up in the later DX movies.(Note that this is early on in the Doki Doki show, so no power ups just yet, and beware of the small spoiler from Smile that shows up in the beginning.)Story (6/10): Pretty simple plot- Precure get invited to fairy school, though it turns out to be a trap to collect their transformation...devices and fairies, which leads to the current Doki Doki team to help save the day with the 2 fairies that caused the whole mess.Yeah, this does have a cliche plot device that I've really come to hate over the years: Stupid Kid Syndrome (or when a little kid who's being annoying/stubborn/naive and falls right into the obvious villains hands, kick starting the plot). Beyond that, it's interesting that we finally have a genre savvy villain, though that only holds out as long as you would expect. It's also kind of funny in that the Doki Doki Precure are the cause for his demise since they aren't in the Precure Textbook.(Also don't think too hard on there being a fairy school when we clearly know that all the fairies have no common origin. It's non-canon anyways kids. ;) )Art (8/10): The art is pretty good all around. Backgrounds are colorful, the humans are all drawn well in their respective styles, and all the different fairies are given (somewhat) unique designs. There is some wonky bits here and there, mostly dealing with close-ups of faces, but other than that everything looks pretty good. (There is the inevitable CG dance ending, which looks good, but a little weird still.)Sound (7/10): Eh...nothing too special here. The actual insert songs are good, including the ending dance with the ED of Doki Doki, so nothing to complain about. It can be a tad too dramatic for its own good at points, but it's only distracting in those isolated spots. All in all, pretty solid.Character (7/10): As I said in the Story section, there's the annoying kid that starts the whole plot. And BOY is Gureru annoying for 2/3 rds of the movie in that overly excited animated little boy way. The other fairy, Enen, is much better and his character development makes so much more sense. For the Precure themselves, they all come off as alright, with the Smile Precure girls coming off much better here than they do in their own show (yeah, that's probably just me, but they did) since they have some other people and variety to work with (and I'll stop there :) ). It suffers from the same problems that most other DX and the other New Stage movie has: too many characters in one movie. I mean, we're on 32 Precure now! Yeesh!Enjoyment (9/10): Since this IS a Precure movie, there's gotta be an awesome last act fight scene. And it really does deliver. I'll admit that I squeed completely when I saw the original Futari Wa team kicking ass, along with the Heartcatch girls being awesome as well. All the other teams do well, with some praise being warranted for the Smile/Doki Doki team up. They balanced the powers pretty well and it really makes me sad that the Smile team couldn't be this awesome all the time in their show. It's also nice to see that the writers are trying to do a better job of getting a little screen-time for all the Precure teams, which is a continuing problem in these movies.(They continue, however, to do a bad job of shoving the Deus Ex Machina Miracle Lights into the movie. Really Toei? At least try a little harder. :/ )While New Stage 2 suffers from the typical pitfalls of the previous DX/New Stage movies, it does do some things right. The battles are fun, the characters come off well, and it looks as nice as its predecessors. Don't look for anything mindshattering here, but if you want to spend an hour and a half or so watching some magical girl goodness, can't go wrong here. devices and fairies, which leads to the current Doki Doki team to help save the day with the 2 fairies that caused the whole mess.Yeah, this does have a cliche plot device that I've really come to hate over the years: Stupid Kid Syndrome (or when a little kid who's being annoying/stubborn/naive and falls right into the obvious villains hands, kick starting the plot).

(There is the inevitable CG dance ending, which looks good, but a little weird still.)Sound (7/10): Eh...nothing too special here. The actual insert songs are good, including the ending dance with the ED of Doki Doki, so nothing to complain about. It can be a tad too dramatic for its own good at points, but it's only distracting in those isolated spots. All in all, pretty solid.Character (7/10): As I said in the Story section, there's the annoying kid that starts the whole plot. And BOY is Gureru annoying for 2/3 rds of the movie in that overly excited animated little boy way. The other fairy, Enen, is much better and his character development makes so much more sense. For the Precure themselves, they all come off as alright, with the Smile Precure girls coming off much better here than they do in their own show (yeah, that's probably just me, but they did) since they have some other people and variety to work with (and I'll stop there :) ). It suffers from the same problems that most other DX and the other New Stage movie has: too many characters in one movie. I mean, we're on 32 Precure now! Yeesh!Enjoyment (9/10): Since this IS a Precure movie, there's gotta be an awesome last act fight scene. And it really does deliver. I'll admit that I squeed completely when I saw the original Futari Wa team kicking ass, along with the Heartcatch girls being awesome as well. All the other teams do well, with some praise being warranted for the Smile/Doki Doki team up. They balanced the powers pretty well and it really makes me sad that the Smile team couldn't be this awesome all the time in their show. It's also nice to see that the writers are trying to do a better job of getting a little screen-time for all the Precure teams, which is a continuing problem in these movies.(They continue, however, to do a bad job of shoving the Deus Ex Machina Miracle Lights into the movie. Really Toei? At least try a little harder. :/ )While New Stage 2 suffers from the typical pitfalls of the previous DX/New Stage movies, it does do some things right. The battles are fun, the characters come off well, and it looks as nice as its predecessors. Don't look for anything mindshattering here, but if you want to spend an hour and a half or so watching some magical girl goodness, can't go wrong here."", ""In 2012, Toei decided to step up their game with the Pretty Cure All Stars movies by focusing less on epic fights and cliche plots, and trying to sprinkle some substance into their later movies, this one included. This idea...was not very well received by the fandom. But I honestly don't mind. In fact, I like this move. It shows that Toei knows that their movies have problems and they want to at least do something to make them better. I'm glad they're trying to do something new with the All Star movies, as I hear the first three are pretty bad. I do like...this movie, but it's honestly not as good as New Stage 1.The story takes place in a fairy world, where fairies who want to become Pretty Cure partners go to school and learn about Pretty Cure. One fairy, Grell, isn't too fond of the Pretty Cure and likes to cause trouble. Another fairy, Enen, is very fond of them but is too shy to do anything. When Grell comes across a crystal in a forbidden dungeon, it becomes sentient and he and the shadow start doing bad things, even going as far as to trick the Pretty Cure into coming to the fairy world so the shadow can encase them in ice and grow strong. Grell even goes as far as to rope Enen into his plot. But once he realizes what he's done, he decides to try and fix it with Enen's help. But can they do it?The animation is pretty much the same as New Stage 1. Not particularly noteworthy, but fluid during the action scenes, and it does its job for the most part. The music has a lot more rock and heavy metal tunes than usual, which is quite odd for a children's movie, not that I particularly mind. At least the music adds to the movie's atmosphere and tension, so I have no problem with it. The Pretty Cure girls don't really get much in the way of development, and again, others are just there to move the plot forward to the point of not having lines, which is both a waste of animation and detrimental to the movie's quality. If you're not going to give characters' lines or a reason to be in the movie, then don't include them at all. But I liked the new fairies and the development they got, cliche and questionable as it is.And by questionable...well, I have one big issue with this movie, and I'm honestly surprised nobody's talking about it. There's a scene where Enen and Grell try to cross a cliff, but Grell falls and Enen tries to save him. At this point, Enen confesses that he considers Grell a friend because he took time to talk with him. But the thing is? There's absolutely NO reason for Enen to consider Grell a friend, especially when all Grell has done is bully him, verbally abuse him, berate his interest in Pretty Cure, and worst of all, rope him into a plot where the shadow encases the Smile girls in ice and making him take the fall for it, even though Grell does regret doing this later on. Does anyone else here notice how questionable this is? Is the movie trying to teach kids that the best way to make friends is if they're nothing but mean and abusive and have to use you for their own ends? That's not how friendship works! I've made friends through finding mutual interests, understanding, and open communication. Grell and Enen NEVER do ANY of this throughout the movie, so I find their whole friendship thing to be really fake and superficial, which makes the whole thing a MASSIVE broken aesop. It really says something when the first New Stage movie portrayed friendship better than this movie did, and I'm surprised Ayumi is getting a lot of backlash and hate when Grell is the one more deserving of it for the way he treats everyone, Enen included! At least Ayumi didn't behave like a b****, but people care too much about her taking up screentime to really bother with the facts. Even if Grell did get better toward the end, none of it justifies his actions, and the fact that everyone forgives him in the end makes the whole thing even more cringeworthy! I know he develops and gets past his flaws, but I can't forgive his treatment of Enen. Characters like Korra from Legend of Korra and Garrod from Gundam X had similar problems in which their actions resulted in repercussions, but at least they didn't do any of it out of malice and weren't outright abusive to their friends, and they actually had time to befriend people and get to know them better before running into problems along the way! I just feel Grell and Enen's friendship could have been executed a lot better. But I do love Enen! He's adorable! I want a plushie of him!Phew! Finally got that elephant out of the room. So yeah, the aesop and its execution are the only things I felt were bad about this movie, along with Grell's previous abusive treatment of Enen. If you want a flashy movie with Precure fighting, then check it out.

As a note, in Precure, I generally do consider fairies and mascots to be synonymous, though this isn\'t the case here, at least at the current moment. Smile Precure, Dokidoki and other Precure teams from past seasons do make appearances in this movie, though they aren\'t the focus and serve a fairly small role outside of plot points.Rather appropriately, the movie has themes of friendship and staying on the right path....Despite how it may seem, Gureru is actually a well-designed character: portrayed as unable to communicate and perhaps unsure of who he truly is, he accidentally stumbles into danger which creates a ""shadow"" of himself which wants only destruction. I\'m a fan of this type of plot, and it shows realistically how Gureru\'s shadow continually escalates to more problematic situations, who remains oblivious but clearly cares for the Cures and his classmates, even if his outward actions and thoughts suggest otherwise. He also begins to realize the danger of the situation on his own and suffers guilt and repents to his classmates, who forgive him. It\'s nice that the story has such a wholehearted moral with a sweet ending for a change. Enen, while not as impressive, also comes out of his shell at the end of the movie, so to speak.Overall, there are a lot of great messages here from suppressing immoral actions you wish to take within yourself, self-control, confidence, and how friendship can make a difference. The movie may not be of much interest to you if you wish to see a mature plot or something focused on the Cures, but for what it is, it\'s more than acceptable. 8/10.

Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7769/Ookami-san_to_Shichinin_no_Nakama-tachi,"['Once upon a time there was a series of light novels by Masashi Okita that played around with certain well known fairy tales. Due to a strange twist of fate (or a complete lack of ideas), the series was chosen to be adapted into anime form, and they all lived happily ever after.Well, not quite.Directed by Iwasaki Yoshiaki (Gokujou Seitokai, Wagaya no Oinari-sama, Gunbuster, Love Hina), Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi (Ookami-san and her Seven Companions), follows the adventures of Ookami Ryouko and her colleagues from the Otogi Bank as they solve people\'s problems, right various wrongs, fight delinquents, and generally act as all round...busybodies.Now where have I heard that before?The main problem with Ookami-san is that it suffers from the same flaw that almost every novel adaptation has - an inherent lack of detail. That\'s not to say that the story doesn\'t work as there are plenty of things already in the tale that are interesting enough. The plot, however, is haphazard in its approach, and a number of points never get explained over the course of the series. Because of these two factors, the story never really reaches the level where the viewer can become engrossed, and in all honesty the only reason I finished it was because I was playing ""Spot the Fairy Tale"".As I mentioned before, the franchise plays fast and loose with several well known fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood (complete with wolf and hunter), Momotaro (with dumplings), The Hare and the Tortoise (which was changed to a turtle for some reason), Urashima Tarou, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Hansel and Gretel, The Little Match Girl, Puss in Boots, and probably a bunch more. Unfortunately, there\'s a side effect to incorporating specific elements of other stories into your own and that\'s exactly what happens here.If one is able to disregard the lack of focus and detail, there\'s still the creativity barrier to overcome and it\'s here where the everything falls down. While the story may have some interesting aspects, the usage of fairy tales places quite a heavy dampener on innovation and it shows in Ookami-san in many ways, from  relationships (Usami Mimi and Ryuuguu Otohime are inclined to hate each for example), to character design.In all honesty, J.C. Staff have produced a fairly decent looking show for the most part. The animation is generally fluid throughout the series, but there are one or two telltale signs of corner cutting during the fight scenes. The backgrounds and settings are pretty standard fare for anyone familiar with high school anime, and while there are no real feats of originality, there are also very few major flaws. The real problem with the overall look of the show though, is the inherent lack of innovation I mentioned earlier.This is where it all gets a bit tricky. On the surface the casual viewer may consider the design of certain characters to be quite original, for example Akai Ringo is supposed to be Little Red Riding Hood and this reference is prominent in her clothing throughout the series. Certain other characters follow this design pattern to highlight the fairy tale they are based on, while others are a bit more subtle with their reference. One of the main issues with this approach is that it impacts on the relationships between the characters, and the reason for it may not be obvious at first. Once the viewer understands the reference then everything becomes clear, however Ookami-san only really works on that basis.One point in the show\'s favour is the sound quality, as the effects are fairly well realised and choreographed. Unfortunately the music isn\'t up to the same standards. That\'s not to say that it\'s bad, no, it\'s simply that it\'s all been done before.Here\'s what I mean. The OP, ""Ready, Go!"" by May\'n is a boppy J-pop track that doesn\'t leave any impact whatsoever. The ED, ""Akazukin-chan Goyoujin"" (Careful Akazukin-chan), by OToGi 8, is a strange mixture of J-pop and chip tunes that is equally forgettable. The rest of the music throughout the series doesn\'t really add much to the atmosphere of a given scene, and the proof of this lies in the numerous occasions where no music is used as there is very little difference in terms of impact.One of the main sound problems with Ookami-san though, is the narration. There are far too many occasions where the viewer will be trying to pay attention to what the characters are saying, only to have it drowned out by Arai Satomi pretending to be an old time storyteller. As for the acting itself, the seiyuu are generally pretty good, with Itou Shizuka and Itou Kanae playing the roles of Ryouko and Ringo with a degree of aplomb (one does have to wonder if the casting was purposeful though). Irino Miyu gives a respectable performance as the sociophobe and prospective beau Morino Ryoushi, especially when he switches between coward and manly mode.The rest pf the cast deliver some good all round performances but, like the rest of the series, the lack of originality means that they simply can\'t sink their teeth into the roles. The prime example of this is the fact that Ryouko is, yet again, quite literally the ""sheep in wolf\'s clothing"".Now I will be honest here. I\'m tired of the typical tsundere loli character and would personally like to see more variety in that department. Surprisingly, it seems as though Ookami-san has made some efforts to move away from the archetype. There are attempts to justify the persona of each character to a degree, and although the results are a bit of a mixed bag, the fact is that this makes the show more interesting than it would otherwise have been. The series takes great pains to delve into the personal history of its lead characters, and some of the resulting stories are handled rather well.But that\'s all there is to it. Once their stories are told the characters go right back to how they were before, with the only real exceptions being Ryouko and Ryoushi. But that\'s not my main gripe where the characters are concerned, no, the real problem here is that there are no reasons or justifications, either in the story or otherwise, for the actions of Hitsujikai Shirou, and the lack of any information leaves the viewer wondering what the hell is going on.Now, while Ookami-san isn\'t a truly great show, it\'s not actually that bad on the whole. The series has a number of interesting aspects and relationships, and is entirely watchable as long as you aren\'t overly critical about it. Unfortunately there are occasions where there is simply too much going on at once, and the viewer may find themselves going back over certain scenes in order to fully understand what has occurred.One thing I did like were the cameos from ToraDora! and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun as, while they may not be my favourite shows, it made the anime into something more of a visual game (spot the reference).It\'s strange how many shows these days are adaptations of other media, and it does make one wonder if anime studios have hit a creative wall. Whatever the case may be, Ookami-san is a decent attempt at adapting a novel series, and while it does have its flaws, the show is entertaining enough for at least one viewing. Granted it may not be everyone\'s gingerbread house, but those that like school based romantic comedies won\'t find themselves too disappointed.Now can we please find a different character type as I\'m tired of of all the tsundere lolis. busybodies.Now where have I heard that before?The main problem with Ookami-san is that it suffers from the same flaw that almost every novel adaptation has - an inherent lack of detail.

The art work and animation was actually pretty and appealing, but the terrible story and cast of characters makes this series a pretty little scab you want to tear off. The rag tag bunch of characters have a very minor development and role so it\'ll feel as if most, if not all, of the characters are a side note. Even the story leaves you hanging till the last episode. At the end of the series, you will ask yourself, ""That\'s it? What the hell was I watching this for?""....I\'m sorry to say this, but I felt as if the writer of the series did a half-assed job and produced a story about kids doing random things without any plot or motive. I say this series was a wild goose chase. I recommend it to those of you who have nothing to do and just want to kill time.

I would like to note however, that this is only designed for users to see if they might be interested in spending their time watching this show. I have no idea how this show will end, as I am only a few episodes in, however, I will try to make this as helpful as possible. So, if the show magically starts being terrible don't come after me with flaming sporks. This is only a review for the first 3...episodes (for now).If you think I didn't do a good job reviewing those episodes, then please, bring your spork army.

A majority of the episodes are parody's  of classic fairytales.The way its done is not only smooth, but exceptionally entertaining. It's to the point where if you know of the story, you can catch the references immediately and if you have never heard of the tale the show is still crisp and you won't be left confused for the most part.The show is  full of plenty of colorful characters, from the main ones Ryoushi(Wimpy kid who has a crush on Ookami, I'm sure you can guess how character development will go with this one) and Ookami (Translate for epic giggles) to the typical lolis and ladies man. There really isn't a character that will make you go crazy for, but there is not any characters that will annoy you to the point you will  immediately drop the show, so I can't really complain.While not a huge deal, I'll toss this in here. The opening theme is decent. Not good, but not horrendous. I can stand watching it instead of ffing past it which is a pretty big deal for me atleast.Overall, the show is enjoyable and just that. This isn't an angel beats or code geass or whatever anime really tickled your peach in the past.

Despite their many successes, I find Ookami to be an incredible bore.Let's start with this: I really hate the narrator. I feel that shows that uses narration heavily are due to the director's lack of ability to convey plot and emotions, and that can't be more true for this show. And I hate Satomi Arai.There are only a few instances where I can follow the character's train of thought, though that wasn't suppose to be hard due to the incredibly simple storyline.\xa0The main antagonist is...so one-dimensional, it feels like he's a last minute addition as a plot device. The climax of the story is just... Can you even call it a climax? I don't even feel the slightest sense of excitement during that. It feels like a cheap way to end the series, and it leaves so many questions but I couldn't really be bothered any more.There's so little material for the main storyline that most of the series focuses on stories of the supporting characters... Which none was really interesting, but at least it's better than the main plot. I suppose Ryoko's tsundere personality is suppose to sell, but beyond that trait, her character got no depth at all. Ryoushi's really irritating as a main character. As a wimp he can't even go to GAR mode properly... You'd hope he'll actually grow up by the end of the series, but all he managed is to overwhelm the bad guys with the final blow like a typical Shounen protagonist.The animation and songs were good. I wont expect any less from J.C staff though... Well... Let's just leave it at that.I think the only thing that this show gotta sell of is Ryoko's tsundere... But come on, really?

The sound was good, it was really enjoyable, the VA was good.CharacterThis is what the anime is, there's a great...variety of characters from fantasy books and you will recognize them, the ones that i liked were Ringo and Ryoushi who at first might seem like a wuss but he shows that he can be a badass for Ryouko the problem is Ryouko was too tsundere for my liking, she hides her feelings for Ryoushi and never accepts them, not even when everyone sees it, and i hated that she didn't appreciated what Ryoushi did for her which mostly ruined the anime.EnjoymentI could have enjoyed this more, but i couldn't because of that bad ending and Ryouko being the way she was so overall it was an ok anime as a whole but ruined by the anime and characters direction, enjoyable but not recommendable. variety of characters from fantasy books and you will recognize them, the ones that i liked were Ringo and Ryoushi who at first might seem like a wuss but he shows that he can be a badass for Ryouko the problem is Ryouko was too tsundere for my liking, she hides her feelings for Ryoushi and never accepts them, not even when everyone sees it, and i hated that she didn't appreciated what Ryoushi did for her which mostly ruined the anime.EnjoymentI could have enjoyed this more, but i couldn't because of that bad ending and Ryouko being the way she was so overall it was an ok anime as a whole but ruined by the anime and characters direction, enjoyable but not recommendable."", 'Translating a book into a movie or show is always a challenge for developers. Why? Because taking all the information contained in a book and trying to cram it into a 2 hour movie is near impossible. So why do developers constantly try and do what seems impossible? Well it is my opinion that books have an uncanny ability to truly capture a readers attention with the use of two things, characters and story. The attention to detail and the ability many authors have to flesh out a character or grab a readers attention with interesting plot twists is what has kept books from dying...out for so long. And so we come back to the question, why do developers try and do seems impossible? Maybe it is to try and reach a new demographic in a day and age where reading just isnt ""cool"" or ""in,"" or maybe developers would just like to create there own interpretation of the original work or maybe they just want to cash in on the success of the book. Whatever the case, developers have tried countless times to try and recreate the magic of a certain book in visual form, and the outcomes range the full spectrum of great and horrible. When it comes to anime, in my opinion, there is one thing that will truly define whether the developers rendition will succeed, time.Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi is based off the light novel of the same name and follows the adventures of Ookami, Ryoushi and the group they work for, Otogi Ginko (Otogi Bank). This anime\'s story really had everything going for it right from the start. While the story\'s structure is by the books, little details kept things fresh and exciting. With a change up of action and romance things were fast paced and while this is not unusual for an anime story line and maybe not original, I couldnt help but smile at parts or notice myself getting drawn in. And yet, this anime\'s biggest downfall is its story. Why you ask, after all my praise do I say that the story is this anime\'s achilles heal? It comes back to what I said in my opening comments, time was what brought this anime to its knees.What Ookami-san (abr. title) really needed was 24 episodes, maybe even 32. While the story and characters are all very enjoyable, because of this anime\'s short length, you only seem to graze the surface of everything. You never seem to get the chance to get deep into things, get under the character\'s skins and see what they see, essentially immerse yourself. Even the story, we only seem to be looking at the tip of the ice berg in the anime, and even the more interesting elements, such as the antagonist only seem to be an after thought, a ""reason"" given to the ""good"" guys to fight evil. I have not read the light novels, but I feel as though the story was not given enough thought. With what I saw at the start, there was more than enough material to really delve deep and grab the viewers attention, and yet instead we are side tracked with usual anime shit such as the usual ""moe moe"" we all seem to want. And while much of the story may seem cliche at times, there was a lot of squandered potential. By the end of the anime, most would have realized that there would be no ""real"" ending, and things would be left unattended. Which is unfortunate because like I said numerous times, Ookami-san had so much potential, so many more characters which could have been developed more, so much more story to be revealed, so much more plot. It all seemed so rushed. My feeling was the developers were trying to cram as much of the story in as possible, but by doing this they were unable to get to the essence of the plot, and unable to draw viewers in.Ookami-san does have some solid strong points though. The animation was very well done, with fight scenes that were enjoyable and smooth. The art was also extremely pleasing, with very good character models and detailed backgrounds. The sound was done very well also, with great voice actors for the main characters, and sound quality that while not outstanding, surely stands above other series in the same genre. Really, by the end of this series, it was these qualities that kept me coming back and allowed me to finish the last few episodes. But anime is not all about the quality of its art or animation.As I stated at the start of this review, Ookami-san\'s biggest weakness was its time management. This show desperately needed 24 episodes. What started out as a great show, by the end left a bad aftertaste, and not because the story or characters itself were bad, but because of squandered potential. It is not impossible to adapt a book into an anime, as there are many examples of great adaptations, but what needs to be addressed when attempting such a difficult task is time. What amount of time is needed to truly convey what the novels were trying to convey? How much time is needed to truly recreate the story? How much time is needed to delve into the necessary characters and develop them? And unfortunately with Ookami-san, the developers didnt seem to ask themselves these questions. out for so long.

It is an interesting idea of using the plots of the worldwide known tales and fables, even though it could sound like a re-post, there are many parodies of such. But here it adds additional shine and depth to the personalities of different characters and makes it easier to follow. Thanks to this, they don\'t even need to use a whole episode to introduce each character - it\'s not hard to remember everyone of them - and the whole team acts...together straight from the beginning, which doesn\'t happen often.The eyesight-fearful ""Hunter"" is considered by me as a rather rare personality, and with his awesome, I could even say cute ending ~su, he truly is something worth of mentioning.The second part of it\'s originality is difficult to get used to. The ""storyteller"" (those who have seen Railgun can say it\'s Kuroko, Misaka\'s roommate from the Railgun anime) tends to speak over the speeches of the main characters. I just can\'t get it over with, and so I watch the scene again, until I\'ve heard both the storyteller and the characters talk (in my case I mean until I\'ve read all the subtitles). And the main thing is, usually both of them are of none importance to me. While I\'ve already noticed the things the storyteller explains, the main characters have a simple chat. So, don\'t get confused by overhearing something and move on. And remember the texts from Bakemonogatari, which are also not intended to be read properly.What comes to the real plot, it has nothing special. A team of students with different specializations solving things, with a little love-comedy in it, a strong girl on the outside but soft in the inside an so on. And it doesn\'t seem it\'ll get better than that.But due to the great characters, I think I\'ll watch on. And this is not a bad anime, no. But quite far from a masterpiece. For those who want masterpieces, watch Beck and Phantom first. together straight from the beginning, which doesn\'t happen often.The eyesight-fearful ""Hunter"" is considered by me as a rather rare personality, and with his awesome, I could even say cute ending ~su, he truly is something worth of mentioning.The second part of it\'s originality is difficult to get used to.

And in exchange for helping them out, their client has to owe them some sort of favor. Not an entirely exciting, nor original concept, but I do enjoy how this anime have a bit of a fairytale-like theme to it.. --mixed in with romance, action, comedy, drama, and even anime references...(such as Zero no Tsukaima & To Aru no Railgun). The story doesn\'t progress too much from there, and they continue on each & every episode about helping a new client. It also often focuses the episodes on telling us more of the characters\' past.. or more development on the romance between Ryouko & Ryoushi.ART- 9The animation is rather fantastic in this. I adore the cutesie looking character, despite the fact that they overdo it sometimes. Lots of pretty girls.. and several decent-looking guys. No complaints here.SOUND- 8Many famous + talented voice actrors/actresses we can recognize from here, like Irino Miyu (Syaoran-Tsubasa Chronicles), Itou Kanae (Amu-Shugo Chara!), Toyosaki Aki (Yui-K-On!), Kugimiya Rie (Shana & Taiga & Louise), Horie Yui (Yuuki- VK & Minori-Toradora!), and tons more.  They are very well-suited for their roles, so no complaints here, either.  I absolutely LOVE the narrator who\'s very much amusing through-out the series, giving us info. & random comments. ( I\'m sure her voice will ring a bell, too.) The opening (sung by May\'n-- also known as Sheryl from Macross Frontier) & ending themes are good, but nothing memorable, nor catchy.CHARACTER- 8There are a lot of development with the main characters and even the side characters\' development.  Lots of the characters\' type are cliche, and we\'ve seen them one too many thems.  In this case, I don\'t mind because all the characters are entertaining.  I must say that our main guy, despite being that same-o ""plain"" guy-type, he has 1 original aspect: phobia at being looked/stared at.  With that, he is no longer that cliche ""nice"" & ""average"" guy.  All the characters are to a satisfactory level.  I like ALMOST all of them.  :]ENJOYMENT- 8I really did enjoyed watching this series. It was possibly my favorite 2010 Summer anime. I laughed, and I may even have cried..(or maybe not..my memories are kinda blurry) for this one certain scene. Each episode were amusing, and a few of the stories seriously touched my heart.OVERALL- 8I think it is TRULY worth-watching.  Not the best series.. Actually, FAR from it (it is what to be expected from a 12-episodes anime). But it has some pretty darn good contents. Give it another season, and Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi might turn into something BIGGER. I also will give it props for not turning this into another harem.. which is kinda surprising (considering how a HUGE majority of the characters are females). A few light fanservice here & there, but I won\'t label this series ecchi.Thank you for reading.  Hope it helps even if just the tiniest bit.  ^^ (such as Zero no Tsukaima & To Aru no Railgun).

So he suggested I watch this because it was exactly what I was looking for, and I trusted that, he\'s hardly steered me wrong.I was severely disappointed to the point where I was just overall very sad and upset. Sounds silly but, I went in expecting a good solid story line which a cast full of characters that were different in their own way, and a strong female character that really made the series. What I was greeted with was...the same every day crap I was trying to avoid, ""Women are weak and they need Men"".Ookami got down played once again by the male lead, which was exactly what I was hoping to avoid. I\'ve never given an anime this low of a rating before, if I wanted flesh bags wagged in my face this would be the perfect anime to do it. Yet when looking for something with a lot more weight and meaning it fell short on all accounts and was a huge disappointment!Not only that...seeing Ookami nearly hit the peak of a strong woman, only to be yanked back down by a man was too sad to watch. I tried to finish it but, I couldn\'t unfortunately. So I extend this warning, if you\'re looking for something that\'ll exhibit the true strength of a woman both physically and emotionally, you won\'t find it in this anime. If you\'re looking for fan service, then please, give it a shot, it\'ll be right up your alley. the same every day crap I was trying to avoid, ""Women are weak and they need Men"".Ookami got down played once again by the male lead, which was exactly what I was hoping to avoid.

First off, this title is completely misleading on the account that there are 8 people around her, not 7.  I understand that the guy comes in later, but he is technically one of her companions.  Anyway, with that little nitpick out of the way, onto the review.Story (7.21/10):  The story of Ookami-san to Shichinin to Nakama-tachi revolves around the high school lives of the Otogi Bank, a club in the school where the story is based in, where they accept the requests of people in the school, in order to get a payment of a...favor in return.  Essentially, this club is the school mafia where you are expected to return the favor, or you will get possibly screwed later on.  Our main protagonist Ookami Ryouko is faced with the fact that someone out of nowhere confessed to her in the middle of the street, before finding out that he is a new member of her Otogi bank club.From a story standpoint, the anime uses its base idea well, branching off several stories from the request/return policy of the Otogi bank as its base.  Every episode, or several episodes, consist of a separate story that has to do with this policy, each with their own story that in the end, reaps some character development that makes the show a bit better as a whole.  But with this idea, there are a few bugs in the mix.One thing that this series has a bit of a downfall in, is its use of time.  While for the most part, the story is well-written and executed rather well, staying true to its own plotline, the plot in certain episodes, diverge from what the main idea is.  In short, side stories.  Roughly a quarter of the series is essentially plot points that don\'t really have much to do with the main plot, and as such, play no real significance altogether.  Mostly, these episodes have to do with certain members within the Otogi bank and give them a little bit of backstory.  This is fine and all, but the actual impact altogether doesn\'t have as much due to the fact that these people who get an episode about themselves, are supporting characters compared to the actual main plot.  Still though, this problem is still quite minor due to the fact that those particular episodes do still have the charm that this series has.Another thing this series has a bit of problem with, is a lack of actual explanation.  There are moments in the series where backstories are explained, mostly about our lovely wolf girl, Ryouko.  What makes this particular thing a downfall, is the fact that when the characters talk about her backstory, there are always some holes.  A few things are mentioned, and you get the general idea of what happened, but the specifics aren\'t mentioned and a clear and concise story of what exactly happened is never really mentioned, different to most animes that have back stories, which usually end in a full telling of what happened.The pacing of the series except for the one episode side stories, is rather decent.  It\'s pretty steady and there are no real faults in the pacing of the story.Overview+  Entire story connects to the main key idea well+  Good pacing throughout the anime-   Missing back story areas-   One-episode side stories that have little plot significanceCharacters (7.89/10):  Take the big bad wolf, little red riding hood, a guy scared of attention, a bodiless narrator, and a whole slew of colorful and overused anime troupes.  This is basically the whole cast of this show.Ookami Ryouko.  With the word ""wolf"" literally as her name, she Ryouko exhibits a sort of tough aura, always stating that she can do things herself, telling the main guy to man up, and overall, is a rather badass female lead.  What is really likable is he fact that she has a very conflicting personality, having a hidden, inner personality that she never shows to people around her.  Quite frankly, she is the show\'s main focus and a reason why this show is relatively good in the first place.  She seems to be more of a real person than many other female characters in the ""tsundere"" category, and is overall, a very good character who is very befitting of a show like this.Morino Ryoushi is the main male lead of the series.  As a timid person who shies away from attention, Morino is shown to be the main romantic lead, as he confesses his love for Ryouko in the very first episode, something that romance tagged animes pretty much never do.  What I like about him is the fact that throughout the series, you can see the growth in him, to the point that watching his actions from episode 1 to episode 12, are completely inverted and different.  Similar to Ryouko, his personality gets fleshed out as the series goes on, without the exception of a backstory.Akai Ringo, or little red riding hood, is the final true main character of the series.  For the most part, she gets a bit of a supporting role, with the exception of her backstory episode, being Ryouko\'s friend, supporter, and companion for the majority of the series.  (Kind of ironic given their base character idea.)  Different though, is the fact that she has a heart of stone, being very conniving and tricky when the plot needs her to be.  She provides a lot of good support to Ryouko\'s role and character in the series.A special character mention that NEEDS to be said, is the narrator.  Contrary to a lot of comedy series, this specific anime has a narrator to tell out the story in a storybook sense, staring pretty much every episode with ""Long, long ago..."" and pointing out the obvious, making her own remarks, as well as breaking the fourth wall to the extent that the characters might as well know that their own existence is an anime.For supporting cast, the anime consists of about 30 or so members, (you heard me, 30), each of them based on some sort of anime troupe from one place of the universe to the other.  (Maid, playboy, studious, sadistic villan, fanservice, etc.)  While for the most part, these supporting characters compliment the show well, some of them play no real purpose beyond a given episode or two.  Also, the fact that the supporting cast is so gigantic, it\'s to the point that remembering their names is an issue.  Without the handy narrator giving mention of their name every time they come on screen, you probably wouldn\'t know who they are, saying ""Hey, it\'s...that guy....yeah..."" Every now and then.  Another problem was the fact that there were some characters that had some decent significance in the plot, but they were either introduced too late or not given enough time to prove what they could offer to the show.Overview+  Fleshed out main characters+  Decent supporting characters-   One note characters that show up at most with an episode, then a cameo-   Too many people to remember  (It\'s like Angel Beats all over again.)Art and Sound (7.01/10 and 7.00/10):  For the most part, the animation is rather average.  It looks pleasing to the eye and there was no real jarring things to see, but nothing truly stood out for me as a scene or piece or artwork that was really astonishing.  The art was good, don\'t get me wrong, but it wasn\'t the best thing I\'ve seen in recent years in terms of artwork.  Although, seeing Ryouko with wolf ears in the opening song was a nice little touch.From a music standpoint, nothing stood out either.  The tracks weren\'t terrible, they were rather good with the opening being a very nice and inspirational song and the ending being a happy-go-lucky electronic one, but nothing really stood out as memorable.  They were good enough to stick around and listen to, but it wasn\'t a god track that you would want to keep in your head forever and ever.Overview+  Decent looking art+  Good soundtrack-  Nothing stood out as ""memorable""Personal Enjoyment (7.45/10):  As a personal fan of animal-themed anime characters, and strong female leads as a whole, I found this series to be quite enjoyable due to the fact that Ryouko prove herself to be a great female lead for this show.  Her character, mixing in various other people that have interesting traits, made the show quite enjoyable.A little complaint or wonderment I had throughout the whole series was if the school even had a legit uniform or dress code, seeing as how pretty much all of the characters never really follow a traditional school uniform that many other school-based anime do.In any case, I personally enjoyed this series.  It was a nice series to relax and enjoy some decent character development while watching a good comedy show.  I enjoyed the quirky characters, the storyline, and above all, the narrator, which made the series far better than what it could\'ve been.  (Seriously, I shudder to think what this series would be like without the narrator.)  I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a comedy anime that has a balance of story-driven and plot-driven idea.Overall Score: 7.48/10 favor in return.  Essentially, this club is the school mafia where you are expected to return the favor, or you will get possibly screwed later on.  Our main protagonist Ookami Ryouko is faced with the fact that someone out of nowhere confessed to her in the middle of the street, before finding out that he is a new member of her Otogi bank club.From a story standpoint, the anime uses its base idea well, branching off several stories from the request/return policy of the Otogi bank as its base.  Every episode, or several episodes, consist of a separate story that has to do with this policy, each with their own story that in the end, reaps some character development that makes the show a bit better as a whole.  But with this idea, there are a few bugs in the mix.One thing that this series has a bit of a downfall in, is its use of time.  While for the most part, the story is well-written and executed rather well, staying true to its own plotline, the plot in certain episodes, diverge from what the main idea is.  In short, side stories.  Roughly a quarter of the series is essentially plot points that don\'t really have much to do with the main plot, and as such, play no real significance altogether.  Mostly, these episodes have to do with certain members within the Otogi bank and give them a little bit of backstory.  This is fine and all, but the actual impact altogether doesn\'t have as much due to the fact that these people who get an episode about themselves, are supporting characters compared to the actual main plot.  Still though, this problem is still quite minor due to the fact that those particular episodes do still have the charm that this series has.Another thing this series has a bit of problem with, is a lack of actual explanation.  There are moments in the series where backstories are explained, mostly about our lovely wolf girl, Ryouko.  What makes this particular thing a downfall, is the fact that when the characters talk about her backstory, there are always some holes.  A few things are mentioned, and you get the general idea of what happened, but the specifics aren\'t mentioned and a clear and concise story of what exactly happened is never really mentioned, different to most animes that have back stories, which usually end in a full telling of what happened.The pacing of the series except for the one episode side stories, is rather decent.  It\'s pretty steady and there are no real faults in the pacing of the story.Overview+  Entire story connects to the main key idea well+  Good pacing throughout the anime-   Missing back story areas-   One-episode side stories that have little plot significanceCharacters (7.89/10):  Take the big bad wolf, little red riding hood, a guy scared of attention, a bodiless narrator, and a whole slew of colorful and overused anime troupes.  This is basically the whole cast of this show.Ookami Ryouko.  With the word ""wolf"" literally as her name, she Ryouko exhibits a sort of tough aura, always stating that she can do things herself, telling the main guy to man up, and overall, is a rather badass female lead.  What is really likable is he fact that she has a very conflicting personality, having a hidden, inner personality that she never shows to people around her.  Quite frankly, she is the show\'s main focus and a reason why this show is relatively good in the first place.  She seems to be more of a real person than many other female characters in the ""tsundere"" category, and is overall, a very good character who is very befitting of a show like this.Morino Ryoushi is the main male lead of the series.  As a timid person who shies away from attention, Morino is shown to be the main romantic lead, as he confesses his love for Ryouko in the very first episode, something that romance tagged animes pretty much never do.  What I like about him is the fact that throughout the series, you can see the growth in him, to the point that watching his actions from episode 1 to episode 12, are completely inverted and different.  Similar to Ryouko, his personality gets fleshed out as the series goes on, without the exception of a backstory.Akai Ringo, or little red riding hood, is the final true main character of the series.

It\'s heartwarming and very funny. I thought the idea of a bank that helps people with problems is such an unique idea and that\'s what I loved most about it.However there was many things missing that could have made it even better. For example, the allusion to the attempted rape of Ryouko could have been better shown if they didn\'t refer to just flashbacks. I had to look up what happened to Ryouko to understand what was going on between her and her ex-boyfriend. It\'s like they touched the surface of the important...even in Ryouko\'s life when they should\'ve dove deeper into her past.I didn\'t like the ending but it\'s not like it was bad for it ended on a good note.I personally like to dub it as the ""fruits basket ending"" syndrome where it ends on a good note but leaves the audience hanging with what they wanted to see.The most disappointing part of this anime is that there\'s no sequel/OVA. There are hundred of fairy tails they could\'ve put into the anime. For example, the Hansel and Gretel siblings? I would have liked to seen them being part of the plot instead of just being allowed to just a few lines.Bottom line: It was a great anime but I was let down by the shortcomings of what they (the animation studio) could have done. even in Ryouko\'s life when they should\'ve dove deeper into her past.I didn\'t like the ending but it\'s not like it was bad for it ended on a good note.I personally like to dub it as the ""fruits basket ending"" syndrome where it ends on a good note but leaves the audience hanging with what they wanted to see.The most disappointing part of this anime is that there\'s no sequel/OVA.

I seem to be on a streak of reviewing anime that I think blew their chance, but here\'s why Ookami-San and Her Seven Companions missed its shot.-Story-Sticking several fairy tale characters from various stories together is by no means an original premise (\'Fables\' comes to mind) but it can still be enjoyable to watch old characters in new ways. The story is mostly episodic, following the staff of the Otogi \'Favors\' Bank from case to case as they work to sort out various problems...around the school. However, it suffers from badly handled tone shifts between scenes covering main heroine Ryouko\'s relationship to the main antagonist, and the parts where it\'s the just the main cast solving problems (without spoiling too much, roughly halfway through the series we learn something about Ryouko\'s past that fundamentally increases the seriousness of the series- but the show still tries to revert to the same comedic tone shortly thereafter). Also, the story misses its chance for a conclusive ending both dramatically and romantically, punting on both accounts and settling for making the final episode effectively filler (I realize this is an adaptation of only part of a series of light novels, but unless a show has a guarantee of a second season, giving open-ended finales just screws the fans over. Come on, how often does a show that ended inconclusively in the hope of getting a second season ACTUALLY get a second season?). The episodes can be enjoyable, but botched tone shifts and the ""Maybe Ever After"" ending keep the story from being anything special.-Art-Go take a flying leap, narrator, Ryouko looks great without two cantaloupes strapped to her chest! VIVE LE PETITE MADEMOISELLES!!! Ahem... now that THAT\'S out of the way on to more serious matters...The art is bright and colorful, but it\'s nothing we haven\'t seen before. I\'d say aesthetically it was pretty similar to Toradora! (J.C. Staff produced both shows, so that\'s not unthinkable). I can\'t think of much to say beyond how quality is good and the style fit the show. Character designs incorporate elements from the fairy tale character each cast member is based on, with varying degrees of subtlety, creating fine designs but nothing that will go on lists of \'Most Originality\'. Ryouko was a little unique in that the fan-service focused largely on her legs ( not the most common part of the female form to center on ) but didn\'t subvert any tropes beyond that. Main male character Ryoushi has an entirely generic and forgettable look. Main antagonist has the \'white haired pretty boy\' design that stopped being original sometime around when Griffith sacrificed the Band of the Hawk to gain demonic powers.-Sound-Brina Palencia seems have a certain knack for playing wolf-girls (she gives them a certain \'spice\' you might say). Her performance in the English dub can cover a variety of emotions and tones well and is the best performance overall.  Narrator Luci Christian provides a great deal of comedy with her often sarcastic take on the on-screen events (""Oh look! A fan-service shot!"") None of the other voice truly stood out, but I can\'t find faults with them either. The OP and ED are catchy, but nothing to go buy and download, and the OST is mood music without a standout track.-Characters-Male lead Ryoushi is a character I connected with very quickly, but largely due to personal reasons (I also spent a good chunk of my high school days as a shy, cowardly guy in hopeless pursuit of various serious, talented, energetic girls who weren\'t going to swoon for just any random bloke) not because his arc is overwhelmingly unique or well-done. His storyline is undermined by constant resets after each time he does something cool in order to maintain status quo. By the end of the series I was able to actually time these character resets (""OK, he\'s going to do something cowardly in 3, 2, 1...""). The ""Cowardly Push-Over Becomes A Heroic Badass And Saves The Day"" is a character arc I love, but the series was never willing to let him stay in Badass mode for long. Female lead Ryouko knows how to Tsundere with the best of them, as her alternating between bitter and sweet attitudes actually has some justification: she\'s struggling between her natural personality and the personality she developed in response to past events. I even thought there was bit of chemistry between her and Ryoushi that a proper ending could have exploited. Most of the supporting characters are serviceable but fairly forgettable, having one main personality trait that doesn\'t really develop (or again, just resets if it does).-Enjoyment-I enjoyed this series, but once I caught on to the dependable character resets and realized there wasn\'t going to be a proper ending I felt disappointed. It\'s the kind of disappointed you feel when you see something you think could have been very good trip and fall into mediocrity ( I need to review something I think did well soon, this trend of writing about anime that fumbled a good chance is getting depressing), not the kind of disappointment you feel when you watch something bad which you never thought had a shot to begin with.-Overall-Alas, comedy and chemistry between the main characters is squandered in the hope of getting a second season.

A proper ending could have made this series endearing, but as it is it\'s just a bit above average. Doggone it anime industry.', 'And so it ends, another 12 episode series that could\'ve made a perfectly good 20+ episode show. I fear this is becoming a trend in the world of animes; well, why not? 12 episode moe-ecchi fests are much cheaper to make than something with a complex plot or characters.But Ookami-san is not one of those animes.I originally started watching this show because I heard about the fairytale references; I love twisted fairytales, so I gave the show a try. But what I found was much more potential than a few laughs, though you get a lot of those too.Story - 7The plot is fairly simple;...Ringo Akai and Ryouko Ookami work as part of the school club, Otagi Bank (i.e, translate all those names if you want a few giggles); a club that can solve any problem you bring them, and in return, you must pay them back in a favor, if/when they might need your help.But after an incident where Ookami-san is saved by another student during a mission, the club owner realizes that their fieldworkers are shorthanded and recruits said student, Morino Ryoushi, to work alongside Ookami and Ringo.The story sounds cliched... until you realize this show is parodying almost every single tsundere anime ever written. And both the characters and the narrator are well aware of it, which is gold to watch! The show pretty much hits every classic moe/tsundere anime reference, and while it milks them for all they\'re worth, it seems to be laughing behind their back at the same time. And then there are all the fairytale references; everything from the obvious Little Red Riding Hood to some sneaky little in-jokes (my personal favorite is the Puss-in-Boots characters,  humorously named Nekomiya, who un-intentionality ends all his sentences with ""nya"").One of the most original parts of this anime is it has a narrator, who tells the story as though reading a book. She is a little annoying, talking over the show from time to time, but she mostly acts as the voice of the viewer and gets some of the best lines. I grew to like this over time. :)The story is usually very episodic; each episode covers a new mission and usually a new person in need of a favor, with the exception of 10-11, which is the only two-parter. The end result of this is a VERY large cast for 12 episode anime, and it often feels like we never get to connect with the characters enough because of the setup.That is one of the only reasons I rated the story low-ish; it\'s a great concept, but the length doesn\'t give the story enough room to grow, even though the show seems to try anyway, which makes the ending even more awkward. Makes me wonder if this wasn\'t originally intended to be +20 episodes...Art - 9The art is probably the main reason people keep comparing this show to Toradora; the animation styles are almost identical, which is no surprise since they were made under the same studio. xDNevertheless, the animation is stylish, fluid, bright colored, always cutesy but somewhat deformed, which gives it a certain individuality. The characters are easy to tell apart and the backgrounds are actually very well designed. There are some obvious moe eyes going on here, but it\'s nothing to the level of Air TV or the like. No complaints!Sound - 10The score for this show is always on-par and always fun; the background music never seems to get repetitive either, like some shows do. The voicework is quite skilled, as expected from J.C group, and like the animation, the voices stand out from each other and are very memorable.The best part of the sound in this show, however, is the OP/ED themes; they\'re so addictive! The opening, ""Ready! Go!"", is sung by May\'n (who many may know from her work in Macross Frontier as Sheryl) and keeps the mood bouncy and fun, and the song itself makes a wonderfully catchy J-pop single. The ED, ""Little Red Riding Hood"" by OToGi8, has the potential to be annoying, but for some reason, kept me watching every time. I almost never skipped through either theme for the entire show; I loved them too much!Character - 10I personally think that if the story doesn\'t get you hooked on this, the motley crew of teenagers running it will. xD The characters here are so gripping and fun, it\'s harder not to like them, despite the plot flaws.The main characters, Ookami-san, Ringo-chan, and Morino-kun, are the best developed in the show, as expected.Ookami-san is, at her most basic, a moody tsundere with a bad temper and trouble expressing what she really thinks. But what I really enjoyed about her is that she is the way she is for a reason; her backstory is actually pretty tough, and you come to understand that her actions and will to fight are not simply meaningless character traits. I kinda felt that the creators didn\'t develop her character fully, but that may just be me.Ringo is a loli-ish girl who is usually quite polite and thoughtful, but also quite devious. She\'s a rather enjoyable character with another surprising backstory, and as Ookami\'s best friend, nicely contrasts the ""attack first, talk later"" attitude that Ryouko often has. And for a cute little girl, she\'s really quite the manipulator! It\'s usually for the sake of my best friend and pushing her to be honest with her feelings toward Morino, but really... she\'s such a devil! ^-^Ryoushi is a shy boy with expert hunting skills. Out of everyone, I felt like his character stood out the most. There\'s just something really cute about a scopophobic having to fight alongside a girl like Ookami, and having a crush on her of all things. His devotion and fervor to Ookami may annoy some, but I found it refreshing in a land of cold-hearted, overtly pretty male leads in anime. He\'s a sweet kid with a lot heart, and brings some of the best humor into the show.The rest of the cast, sadly, doesn\'t develop very much beyond their basic characteristics. They\'re fun, but as I mentioned above, it often feels like you never get to know them well enough. The only ones that maybe evolve beyond the secondary are Tarou and Otohime, both of whom are simply awesome both separately and as a couple!Overall- 8I started this show when it was only two episodes into the Japanese airing, and stayed all the way through. Despite the fact that I watching Kaichou wa Maid sama and second season of Kuroshitsuji weekly as well, this show really became the thing I looked forward to the most! It\'s a shame it ended so fast, the potential for a full length series was great and I had so much fun watching it, but they kinda hint to a second season, so... *fingers crossed*But my overall feelings for Ookami-san are this: the story is simple and definitely shorthanded, but the characters are excellent and the concept is fun. So I would recommend it to anyone who likes humor and parody, as well as good dose of tsundere, or even if you\'ve got 6 hours to kill; it may just surprise you how much you like it! ^-^ Ringo Akai and Ryouko Ookami work as part of the school club, Otagi Bank (i.e, translate all those names if you want a few giggles); a club that can solve any problem you bring them, and in return, you must pay them back in a favor, if/when they might need your help.But after an incident where Ookami-san is saved by another student during a mission, the club owner realizes that their fieldworkers are shorthanded and recruits said student, Morino Ryoushi, to work alongside Ookami and Ringo.The story sounds cliched... until you realize this show is parodying almost every single tsundere anime ever written.

The end result of this is a VERY large cast for 12 episode anime, and it often feels like we never get to connect with the characters enough because of the setup.That is one of the only reasons I rated the story low-ish; it\'s a great concept, but the length doesn\'t give the story enough room to grow, even though the show seems to try anyway, which makes the ending even more awkward. Makes me wonder if this wasn\'t originally intended to be +20 episodes...Art - 9The art is probably the main reason people keep comparing this show to Toradora; the animation styles are almost identical, which is no surprise since they were made under the same studio. xDNevertheless, the animation is stylish, fluid, bright colored, always cutesy but somewhat deformed, which gives it a certain individuality. The characters are easy to tell apart and the backgrounds are actually very well designed. There are some obvious moe eyes going on here, but it\'s nothing to the level of Air TV or the like. No complaints!Sound - 10The score for this show is always on-par and always fun; the background music never seems to get repetitive either, like some shows do. The voicework is quite skilled, as expected from J.C group, and like the animation, the voices stand out from each other and are very memorable.The best part of the sound in this show, however, is the OP/ED themes; they\'re so addictive! The opening, ""Ready! Go!"", is sung by May\'n (who many may know from her work in Macross Frontier as Sheryl) and keeps the mood bouncy and fun, and the song itself makes a wonderfully catchy J-pop single. The ED, ""Little Red Riding Hood"" by OToGi8, has the potential to be annoying, but for some reason, kept me watching every time. I almost never skipped through either theme for the entire show; I loved them too much!Character - 10I personally think that if the story doesn\'t get you hooked on this, the motley crew of teenagers running it will. xD The characters here are so gripping and fun, it\'s harder not to like them, despite the plot flaws.The main characters, Ookami-san, Ringo-chan, and Morino-kun, are the best developed in the show, as expected.Ookami-san is, at her most basic, a moody tsundere with a bad temper and trouble expressing what she really thinks. But what I really enjoyed about her is that she is the way she is for a reason; her backstory is actually pretty tough, and you come to understand that her actions and will to fight are not simply meaningless character traits. I kinda felt that the creators didn\'t develop her character fully, but that may just be me.Ringo is a loli-ish girl who is usually quite polite and thoughtful, but also quite devious. She\'s a rather enjoyable character with another surprising backstory, and as Ookami\'s best friend, nicely contrasts the ""attack first, talk later"" attitude that Ryouko often has. And for a cute little girl, she\'s really quite the manipulator! It\'s usually for the sake of my best friend and pushing her to be honest with her feelings toward Morino, but really... she\'s such a devil! ^-^Ryoushi is a shy boy with expert hunting skills. Out of everyone, I felt like his character stood out the most. There\'s just something really cute about a scopophobic having to fight alongside a girl like Ookami, and having a crush on her of all things. His devotion and fervor to Ookami may annoy some, but I found it refreshing in a land of cold-hearted, overtly pretty male leads in anime. He\'s a sweet kid with a lot heart, and brings some of the best humor into the show.The rest of the cast, sadly, doesn\'t develop very much beyond their basic characteristics. They\'re fun, but as I mentioned above, it often feels like you never get to know them well enough. The only ones that maybe evolve beyond the secondary are Tarou and Otohime, both of whom are simply awesome both separately and as a couple!Overall- 8I started this show when it was only two episodes into the Japanese airing, and stayed all the way through. Despite the fact that I watching Kaichou wa Maid sama and second season of Kuroshitsuji weekly as well, this show really became the thing I looked forward to the most! It\'s a shame it ended so fast, the potential for a full length series was great and I had so much fun watching it, but they kinda hint to a second season, so... *fingers crossed*But my overall feelings for Ookami-san are this: the story is simple and definitely shorthanded, but the characters are excellent and the concept is fun. So I would recommend it to anyone who likes humor and parody, as well as good dose of tsundere, or even if you\'ve got 6 hours to kill; it may just surprise you how much you like it! ^-^', ""Oh look! Another moe-moe animu! Is it just another merchandise driven and annoying piece of crap or is it something actually pretty decent and enjoyable? Fortunately, Ookami-san is the latter, although I have some qualms with it.In a nutshell, the plot is pretty simple. (Go read MAL's synopsis.)We’ve heard the “We help people in an episodic fashioned!” plotline many times before. Wash, rinse, and repeat. Bakemonogatari, To Aru Kagaku no Railgun, and a lot more basically, but Ookami-san gets away with it, because its just so damn likable, despite the very derivative nature of it. Ookami-san is not trying to be the most unique or...original, its just one of those non-pretentious anime where you can sit back, relax, and watch the characters do some crazy stuff. And in that regard, Okami-san delivers in its fairy tale referencing glory. If the characters weren’t so enjoyable, this anime would have utterly failed.Now, the characters themselves are pretty much all moe/harem stereotypes that we’ve seen before, but with a slight tongue-in-cheek air about them. We have the socially inept guy, the classic tsundere, the meido girl, the mad scientist, the token loli, the obsessive lover, the list goes on and on. But somehow, I actually liked the characters and they’re quirks. They’re not too annoying or aggravating and I enjoyed all of the cliched situations the characters would find themselves in. From popularity contests, pool time, Meido dress up, fireworks, mock dates, you name it, this anime has it all. I know it sounds like played-out drivel, but Ookami-san’s self aware nature makes it all worthwhile. I mean, Ookami-san plays the genres tropes so straight that it has to be a homage or a parody, adding the fact that there is a narrator, who points out the cliches in the story also proves my point even further. Although, the narrator can get overbearing and unfunny at times, she does a great job of saying exactly what the audience would say of the cliched nonsense and for the most part, shes pretty hilarious.The characterization for the male lead Ryoushi is very well done. He starts off as a  pitiful loser, but then becomes a stronger individual through his ambition and determination to protect Ryouko and love her. Which makes him the most layered and rounded character unfortunately, because everyone else just stays grounded in they’re archetypes with no real drive of their own. Sure, some of the cast receive episodes catered to them, but they never really add anything new to their stereotypes or even get anything important to the plot accomplished. Which will turn off people who have no tolerance for moe or harem, since Okami-san is very much one of those “otaku-centric” anime. I honestly didn’t mind it, but Ryouko’s character really pissed me off the most. Despite several of the hardships Ryoushi endure in order to prove himself to her, she stays seated in her tsundere bullshit. *Slight Spoiler* Instead of having her character develop and finally confess her love to Ryoushi, since its painfully obvious, you know what she says “I don’t dislike him” Are freaking kidding me? That’s all you have to say Ryouko after all of the events in episode eleven!?! Give me a break. This alone completely shattered anything I liked about Ryouko previously, and made her just another poorly written tsundere. The conclusion as a whole itself, is unsatisfactory as well. It just ends. No real resolve to anything or goal reached. Hopefully J.C. Staff will produce another season.The production values for Ookami-san is excellent! Easily one of J.C. Staff’s best animated works. Filled with fluid, realistic, and fast paced movement with wonderfully fanciful, vibrant, and colorful artistry. Attractively cute moe character designs and highly detailed backgrounds. I was actually in shock by the pure effort that was put in the imagery. Ookami-san is in no way a bad looking anime. The music is pretty well done too. Even though Ready Go!; the opening theme, Is not May’n’s best performance, it fits with the upbeat and whimsical nature of the anime. The  ED is also pretty catchy too.Another great aspect about the anime is in the voice work. The seiyuu voice all of the characters with such life and cooperation with one another. I especially like to point out Ryouko’s voice actress; Shizuka Itou. I’m so glad J.C. Staff used another seiyuu for one of their ‘premiere’ tsundere’s. Rie Kugumiya is over used, thank goodness Shizuka played Ryouko with such differentiation from Tiaga, Louise, and Shana. Ryouko is more brash and masculine than your average tsundere, so of course she’ll need a different voice and Shizuka definitely fitted the bill perfectly with her performance. Also, Satomi Arai as the narrator is freaking brilliant! ‘Nuff said. In fact, any fans of the To Aru series will definitely get a kick out of the voice work as many of the seiyuu from Raildex return here.Overall, Ookami-san is all out otaku pandering fest. You’ll love for all of the stereotypes and clichés or you’ll hate it for that same exact reason. It was a fun ride, but damaged by the lack of development, a terrible ending, and a lack of progression in the plot and characters. Its basically one of those ‘time-waster’ anime. Not excellent or riveting, but not disposable either.Copy & pasted from my Tumblr: http://chibimonogatari.tumblr.com/post/1144220277/ookamisanteenchibireview original, its just one of those non-pretentious anime where you can sit back, relax, and watch the characters do some crazy stuff.

In the best case, the use of fairy tales can be woven into the fabric of the story and become something special like Princess Tutu. Adversely, the use of fairy tales can be nothing more than a quick gimmick with no substance behind it. Unfortunately, Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi (or Okami-San and Her Seven Companions) falls squarely into the latter of those possibilities.The show fallows the exploits of the Otogi Bank, a club in Otogi High School which does favors for students in exchange for returning...the favor  later on. Among the members of the Bank is fierce and tough-as-nails Ryouko Ookami (the \'wolf\' in the story as her name might indicate) and her best friend, and little red ridding hood lookalike, Ringo. Unknown to Ruouko she has a secret admirer in the painfully shy Ryoushi... unknown until he attempts to confess to her and subsequently joins the Otogi Bank. Ryoushi wants to get closer to Ryouko, but that is easier said than done as her past has lefter her with a scared and guarded heart.If this is sounding like a typical rom-com with a tsudere at its core, it is because that is exactly what the show is. All the fairytale stuff is just kind of stapled on. The rest is the usual school-life anime fixings. From the cast of wacky archetypes, to silly episodic stories, to the tough girl and wimpy guy romance; it is all retread material dozens of other anime series also use.Admittedly, the fairytale aspect does add a little extra flavor; seeing classic fairy tales being applied to situations and shenanigans the characters get themselves into has a certain novelty to it. Particularly amusing is the Turtle and Hare rivalry between Otohime and Mimi, along with a few other episodic spins on fairy tales, like the absolutely ridiculous take on Cinderella in the first episode. Not to say that the episodic stories are good, often they are rather hackney, but they can be fun. Another thing that adds some personality to the show is the narrator, who often makes snark comments; making fun of the characters and calling out tropes in the story. This shows that Ookami-san doesn\'t take itself too seriously, which is good, seeing how over-tread its material is. Still, when you have the narrator taking shot at the story, you know the story is in trouble.When the show gets dramatic, it gets mixed results, mostly underwhelming. While the silly stories in each episode can be funny and amusing, but are all rather weak dramatically. Attempts to appeal to your emotions, like Otsuu\'s (the maid in the Otogi Bank) need to repay favors or Ringo\'s relationship with an upperclassmen, ring hollow. Your never really invested with most of the cast to begin with, as they are mostly just background, and trying to make you sympathies with them with only a single episode focusing on them (if even that) feels very forced and ineffective. The only drama that does work is regarding Ryouko\'s past, and to a lesser extent her relationship with Ryoushi. Unlike a lot of tsuderes, Ryouko has a fairly viable reason for being so fiercely asocial; hiding past hurt behind a brave face. It is also cute to see her warm up and confide with Ryoushi and see him become more bold for her sake. Still, these development are pretty conventional and lack actual complexity, giving the show very little weight.Visually and musically, the show is rather uninspired. Character designs aren\'t bad by any means, just generic.  Ryouko\'s design may as well be a billboard with the words ""I\'m a tsundere!"" written on it, not to say her flat-chested figure isn\'t cute. Ringo is looks like the token cute and mischievous munchkin that she is, and Ryoushi looks just as flat as most male ecchi protagonists. The animation is fine, and character designs stay on model most of the time (usually losing form a little in action sequences), but it feels flat because there is honestly no real inspiration behind it. The music follows suit. Bubbly electric pieces and a few orchestrated ones, the soundtrack isn\'t really bad, but exactly what you would expect from this type of show, and ultimately unmemorable. Only the cute opening and ending themes are even remotely memorable, and even then, still pretty generic.Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi is the kind of show that will fade to the back of your mind shortly after watching it. It really doesn\'t do anything with its fairytale premise. It is but a single high school rom-com in an ocean of high school rom-coms. The only real compliment that can really be given is that the show does not do anything tremendously wrong. the favor  later on.

Anyway He confesses to Ookami because thats what sociophobes do, and tells her his confession to which he gets denyed but denial isn\'t something that bothers Morino because later he joins a team with Ookami and uses events and flag points to sway her to his favor.Ending goes something with enemy school de la ghetto decides that even though they got beaten by Morino and Ookami, they can take the entire bank, which starts with kidnapping Ookami. Ohoho but soon they realize that it was all masterminded by Ookami\'s past loved one, and as Morino and (past loved one) fight it out, (which oddly PLO had a knife yet never used because advantages are unfair) Ookami gets over the past trauma and Morino and Ookami both win, which is to say until the Bank decides to leave them alone and negotiate through IMs.Last Minute Notices:Narrator talks over the people sometimes, which is annoying as hell.This anime parody\'s scene shots which is funny till overused.Morino has a lisp and is very bipolar with his sociophobe so take it to account.Other than Ookami and Morino, all other characters are very minor, even the main bad guy.So in the end this anime is like putting ketchup on potato chips, yes its something you might wanna try, but there are so many better things to eat, like potato chips in sandwiches. with some-sort of incesty feelings towards one and another but they deny their incest so i guess its ok.They do some referencing in the anime-notably ToraDora and some other anime.Again these are just lentils compared to the real chunk in which we dive now.The main characters work at a ""favor"" bank where they do favors for students expecting favors back. weirdly enough they seem to be spending favors faster than they could make em seen in a swimsuit ep(sigh) where they blow their savings on telling the students not to vote for their own bank employees.Anyhoo that being the setting the real dilemma is that something happened to Ookami(wolf) by a mysterious guy which turned her mentally into a man, being aloof in trait and does boxing,Due to that trait Morino(hunter) and Akai(Red Riddin) get attracted to her, where they get feelings of ""ooh she is strong"" and ""I want to protect you"" which seems to be the generic feelings these days of making girls strong yet need to be protected - because they are girls.Also Morino is sociophobic which means he unable to look at people, reason for it- because he is a hunter and takes comfort in seeing and not being seen, which is weird because Snake in Metal Gear Solid takes this to an extreme and he himself is not sociophobic at the least.

Although the end was really obvious and cliche. You can watch it if you have nothing else to watch or just like a hobby. The characters are awesome. Nothing pretty special. But you can enjoy them too. I don't know if it's funny or not since I don't laugh easily with animes. Not even with Ookami-san. But you can enjoy the anime a lot. There aren't a lot of episode as you can see. The art is beautiful. It reminded of Toradora! But they aren't even similir if you think so. Well, I recommend it to everyone who doesn't...have anything to watch. Just that :D have anything to watch. Just that :D"", 'I like it, it’s so cute! The stories all have a fairy tale to go with the story. It has the story of little red and the tortoise and the hare. All of the stories are pretty twisted tales and rather creative. There is sadly a couple that I’m not sure where they came from, though they still hold the fairy tale style.I do have a small bone to pick. Barely any of the episodes have anything to do with the main story plot, bringing more of the story by week feel to the show. It makes me a little sad that we don’t...get much of the story line. What it is replaced with though is us learning more about the characters so it doesn’t feel much like filler. Things only really pick up at around episode 10 but by then, it was pretty much over with. It gets rather serious then, and actually rather romantic. Sadly, it doesn’t stay for two long.Ryoshi Morino is a really sweet and shy guy, though who needs to just toughen up a little. It would be easier if he did. Otherwise, I think it works out rather nicely. He is strong when he actually puts his mind to it as seen in episode 2. He does become sort of other people’s punching bags at times to though which doesn’t help make his character any easier to read.Ryoko is really interesting with these dual personalities she shows. They show up really early which is surprising. I would have thought that it would of happened way later. Not that I am really complaining. It just made the character a bit easier to actually feel more for her.Akai is another interesting character, always smiling but ends up pushing Ryoko into a lot of different things including dates. She is like a little terror but is a true friend to her in every way, even taking care of her by cooking and cleaning.The animation is pretty nicely done, only one or two flaws but nothing that serious. There are times where characters end up looking a bit rough and runny egg like. The story artwork does jump around just a tad and it’s a little hard to sometimes understand. They did pretty well with how the designed the characters, making them fit the role they were supposed to fit almost perfectly.The English voices are pretty nice and I love the comedy that the narrator brings up every once in a while. She actually becomes part of the story in herself with the antics. I am talking about her in the voices because that’s all we hear of her. The old women voice is perfect for the fairy tail feel… a twisted fairy tail style! Most of the other characters work rather nice. The music is very good, capturing the feeling of some scenes.Just to let you know, you should keep watching all the way threw the credits on most of them because they have little extra things happening. get much of the story line.

She actually becomes part of the story in herself with the antics. I am talking about her in the voices because that’s all we hear of her. The old women voice is perfect for the fairy tail feel… a twisted fairy tail style! Most of the other characters work rather nice. The music is very good, capturing the feeling of some scenes.Just to let you know, you should keep watching all the way threw the credits on most of them because they have little extra things happening.', 'Here goes my first ever review! ^_^ for Ookami-san to Shinchin no Nakamatachi, or just, Ookami-sanSTORYI\'ll try to be as spoiler-free as possible. The main female protagonist is Ookami Ryouko. She works for the Otogi Bank, which helps people, but in return, those people should help them if the need arises. The main male protagonist is Morino Ryoushi. A scopophobic (afraid of being stared at) boy who falls for Ookami. The story revolves around the two as their relationship deepens, as the Otogi Bank encounters various requests. It may sound simple, but the twist is that, some of the request are parodies of fairy tales....It may sound like a whack idea, but they made it work.ARTFight scenes are awesome to look at. Scenery is cool too.I honestly couldn\'t find anything wrong the art itself. It\'s still up to today\'s standards, and if you\'ve watched other J.C. staff works, you might feel at home here.SOUNDThe OP theme ""Ready, Go"" by May\'n is fine. It doesn\'t suit the story as much, but it goes well it anyway. The ED theme is also pleasant in its own way. In terms of voices, my only complaint was that the narrator would sometimes overlap the characters, making the scene confusing at times.CHARACTERBasically, you only need to focus on Ookami-san and her seven companions, because there\'s not much character development. It\'s not as bad as it sounds, really. Ookami\'s character is great. There\'s something about her that makes her cool and adorable at the same time. Ryoushi\'s character is your not-so-regular hero, but, he is also pleasing to watch.ENJOYMENTI enjoyed it a lot ^_^ It\'s one of those short but sweet anime that makes you want more of it.OVERALLI highly recommend this one to those who want a light, funny, and sweet anime in their memories.

The designers came up with a good premise and did their absolute to shove as many anime stereotypes in as they could. The moe, the tsundere, the shy, prettyboy, crazy, etc...Unfortunatly while this made the characters overall quite loveable it shoves down said aspects down your throat. 90% of the show feels like filler, and when they try to do any actuall plot work it is rushed, cliche, and very forcefull. The ending doesn't completely flow either and no real resolution is...made. It's obvious the creaters were banking on making a second season. My opinion for any of you reading this. If your looking for a show to half watch half play your gameboy go for it. The characters are overused you'll be able to figue out what's going on. If you want a show that has great plot, purpose, great characters, and a desire to teach you somthing. Go watch an old season of Gundam. -_- made.

It had some interesting elements, such as the revamped story book characters and the overall plot was good however it often missed on its pacing, progression, and overall wow factor.The art was Good throughout featuring unique looking characters and the scenery and backgrounds were clean as well.  The characters themselves being based on fairy tale characters was a unique concept though this could of been expanded on throughout the show and made into a more interesting feature.This series features a narrator which to be blunt was the most annoying thing...I have yet to incounter in any anime.  Not only was the narrator there for comic relief mostly, but in addition to the inaffective jokes, she would talk over the characters conversations often at crucial plot points.  The narrator became even more agrivating as the series went on and she began to repeat character introductions.  Furthermore when the transition from the anime talking to the narrator butting in happened it often caused the sound quality to lowered, and the volumn would fluctuate on the transition.  This series would of been better off without this feature.The character progression focused mostly on Ryoushi and Ryouko who grew as the story moved forward.  The side characters changed little and though I was mostly watching for the story between the two characters it seemed the others around them went through a lot as well but hardly changed.  It made the story feel closed off and distanced the Ryoushi and Ryouko from the rest of their group.Finally the pacing of the story was not great.  It seems to me first of all that episode 12 should of came before episode 10 and 11, from a climatic standpoint.  Furthermore the progression of Ryoushi was all over the place as in some episodes he would do better with his phobia but then the very next he would seem much worse.  I more or less like pacing that has a grand cressendo with a nice neat finish, which this series did not have in my opinion at all.However, despite the many set backs I did ultimately get caught up in the love story, laugh with the puns and comedy, and feel the struggles of the hero and heroine as they made their way through their ordeals.  So as entertainment goes this anime series did its job for me there, though I will probably not recommend it unless it seems to fit an individuals personality or anime likes.Overall Rating 5/10@GameJok3rhttp://animejok3r.tumblr.com I have yet to incounter in any anime.

NoHow's the story? NonexistentHow are the characters? MehOokami san has a lot of potential but has major flaws.  Every episode is basically filler but it TRIES to have some real plot deep down.  To me, this show is supposed to be focused on comedy but it falls flat on its face.  There's supposed to be some romance going on between the two main leads but that barely goes anywhere.  Why? I have no fucking clue.  The characters are pretty one dimensional and forgettable.  They try to make Ookami san this tough character but it turns...out she's weak on the inside and wants someone to support her.  At first this sends a strong message that you can't take on everything by yourself and that you need people that you can rely on but somehow they use this to make our supposedly strong female lead to look weak.  She can be completely overly emotional and she was scared shitless when she was captured by those gang members.  Fear is fine but if you're gonna make her out to be this strong independent woman then you can't make her have this scared little pussy side as well, they play against each other.Now before I get people hating me let me say something good about this show.  The art isn't bad and if the entire anime was based off of ookami san and her friends battling that other school, this would've been an amazing anime.  Those last two episodes where everyone was getting kidnapped and there was this whole school war were really interesting and I wanted to see more of that.  BUT NO, they save everybody, do absolutely NOTHING about the big bad guy in charge and then go back to the same old bullshit.Now this is the BIGGEST problem this show has.  THE NARRATOR WON'T SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!  Jesus it's like she likes the sound of her own goddamn voice.  This would only be slightly annoying if she said things that were important BUT NO.  This bitch does nothing but say shit that has no meaning or purpose.  Matter fact, most of the stuff she says is obvious shit that a two year old could figure out on its own.  She also talks over the characters when they're talking so most of the time I miss a good chunk of their conversations.  I don't know who's idea this was but GET RID OF HER.  She's not funny and she's not entertaining. out she's weak on the inside and wants someone to support her.

The story was all over the place, and when there was advancement in the plot, it just led to nothing. Its like it shows you a plot, and then out of nowhere they go HEY, just joking, its not really important. And even in the end all it did was left you hanging, there was no closure what so ever. The only reason I even stayed was cause Ookami reminded me of Aisaka Taiga. That is it. Nothing else. ', 'When I watched this anime I thought that I might get a decent love story... but the love story sucked. But the jokes were pretty funny and the fight scenes were pretty enjoying.The Characters are all pretty boring except Ringo and the club president. They are awesome!The main character Ryouko is afraid of attention witch is pretty funny at times :)The main thing I hated about this anime was the damn narrator voiced by Arai Satomi... I wouldn\'t have anything against her because I love the voice she is making, but she narrates while the other characters are talking. And she keeps telling us...what the characters are thinking and I think that is unnecessary at times.The love story was just boring it was like ""I love you"" and that was it almost... that was the only thing I got from it.But like I said the fight scenes is both good and funny.SPOILER WARNING!!!This might be a spoiler so I’ll try to make it short. There is a reason why Ookami is the way she is. And that reason is the bad guy. I didn’t really get if they actually defeated him because Ryouko was getting his as handed to him, and then he threw one punch at the bad guy… and that was it! Did they defeat him with that or is he coming back… come on! >< what the characters are thinking and I think that is unnecessary at times.The love story was just boring it was like ""I love you"" and that was it almost... that was the only thing I got from it.But like I said the fight scenes is both good and funny.SPOILER WARNING!!!This might be a spoiler so I’ll try to make it short.

It\'s a simple episodic anime with a decently large cast of likable, if not the most original, characters. Our male protagonist, Ryoushi, actually doesn\'t have anything to do with this organization at the beginning of the story. He does, however, have a crush on our female lead Ōkami. While Ryoushi has some extreme troubles with shyness, he manages to protect Ōkami from some attackers, and somehow manages to confess to...her within the day. Ōkami refuses his confession, but her best friend Ringo tracks Ryoushi down and convinces him to join them at Otogi Bank.From here the anime takes no delays in getting right to the first of many one episode stories that the show\'s structure is built on. Normally I would consider this kind of storytelling to be boring and unengaging, but Ōkami-san manages to be, at the very least, more entertaining with this layout than I expected. Its most unique factor is the fact that all of the stories are based (very loosely) on one fairy tale or another. Some are more obvious than others, but the first episode makes the intentions of the show very clear with its obvious parody of the well-known Cinderella story. From there on out the plots of each episode are more or less inspired by various familiar fairy tales. This aspect was very hit-and-miss for me; some of the episodes, such as episode three\'s The Tortoise and the Hare theme, felt unique and relevant, while others like Snow White often seemed superficial at best. Regardless, an effort was definitely made each time, and I can at least appreciate that.Aside from the situations, the characters themselves were also a mixed bag of generic, boring, and pleasant surprises. Most of the usual archetypes are there and not too different from what a typical anime viewer is used to by now. Most of the characters do have some sort of interesting backstory or developments that separate them somewhat from the caricatures you are used to, but this itself even has flaws. The histories of the characters who are looked into are typically brought about suddenly and without much fanfare, usually delving deep enough to be engaging but not enough to be meaningful or make me feel anything most of the time. Then there is Ōkami\'s backstory which, without spoiling anything, is interesting but is never really explained for what seems to be the sake of keeping the show\'s content acceptable for the target audience - a disappointment, to say the least. The gist of it can be gathered, but the clear avoidance of certain topics makes me want more.On the other hand are the background characters, who receive almost no development whatsoever and stay ambiguously strange and unappealing for the entirety of the series. The poster girl for this flaw is Majo, the crazy scientist. I would say more, but there is quite literally nothing else I can say about her despite Majo appearing in every episode and apparently being an active member of Otogi Bank. Other characters, like the President of the club and his cousin, follow a similar pattern, and it is sad when the one episode side characters have more personality than recurring characters that the viewer is supposed to feel something for.On a similar note, there is an overarching plot that is slowly expanded upon until the last few episodes, but its ending was significantly anticlimactic, making me wonder how badly J.C. Staff wants a second season after teasing us with an arc like that.The comedy is nothing to write home about. Near the beginning of the series it is typically almost embarrassing; half the time I wasn\'t really able to tell if what was happening was supposed to be funny or not. Somehow this does improve over time and Ōkami-san finds its groove, but that might be a result of the show becoming a tad more serious and the joke scenes becoming clearly different from the more serious ones. Overall, though, comedy is most definitely not one of Ōkami-san\'s draws or strong suits.I also have a love/hate relationship with the art and the music. The BGM is all well and nice, just about always fitting of the atmosphere and the scenes, but nothing ever stood out to me. The character designs are very familiar to anyone with any recent anime experience, so much so that you might be right to call it plagiarizing if fans weren\'t so forgiving. However, I feel as if this is, for the most part, J.C. Staff\'s fault; the illustrations related to the original light novels are nicely stylized and appealing, while the adaptation\'s versions of these characters aren\'t so interesting, so I can\'t help but feel disappointed in that regard.Overall, while Ōkami-san to Shichinin no Nakamatachi was quite a rollercoaster ride of surprises and disappointments, I did at the very least look forward to what it had to offer each week.

In the end though, I can\'t shake a sweeping feeling of mediocrity.', ""Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi is an anime that had some potential, but ended up going nowhere after being dragged down by a variety of factors.First up is the narration aspect.  Clearly intended to be a comedic device, the narration was funny, I guess, in a forced way. However, it clashes with the fact that this anime was supposed to be a RomCom, dragging down some of the show's few potentially impactful serious scenes with random comedy that falls flat. Also, the narration comes in randomly over top of the regular lines, making it so that they can't be heard. While the lines that...get blocked out are never all that important, it still detracts from the experience. This sort of comedy narration might work in a pure comedy, but it just annoys here.Second, the story ends up going nowhere. While watching the final episode, I felt like I must have missed an episode and skipped to an extra. Major plot points are left completely unresolved. Throughout the show, sometimes the episodes progress the plot, and other times they don't, making pacing rather erratic. The romance aspect never really went anywhere either.Third, the characters had some potential, but never really coalesced into anything. They felt vague - like faceless ghosts that are in a human shape, but have no clear identity. For example, Ookami is actually a half-decent character concept, if not entirely original. She's the reason I wanted to watch this show in the first place. But the show can't seem solidify her character. There's nothing wrong with having a character who appears strong but hides some weaknesses, but it never really felt believable. Sometimes she'd be the strong Ookami, and then other times she would be the damsel in distress. Somehow, those two aspects were never really pulled together to create a believable character who has both strengths and weaknesses. The same could be said for Ryoushi. Most of the time, he's a weakling, but then he becomes a powerhouse out of the blue, and those two aspects never feel justified.There were some moments I really enjoyed, but they were few and far between. Those moments are why I feel that this could have been a good show, especially romance-wise, but in the end it just came across as a total mess with a bunch of corny 'hero saves the damsel in the distress' scenes, among other overused tropes. A greater focus on the primary plot points, some better character development, and balancing the serious plot and romance aspects with the comedy more tactfully are what this show really needed to shine. get blocked out are never all that important, it still detracts from the experience.

The way that is done well is by giving each character some realm of like-ability, but then also never strays away from the main character and trying to build your attachment to Ookami....Sound has the lowest score because to me sound isn't the best use of a score system in most anime because many use the same or similar sounds and in this case the sounds are good, but nothing special. When it comes to my overall opinion the biggest factors to me come from character and story. Mostly because those will directly influence my enjoyment. The story takes the turns it directly needs to and still gives that level of peril that you need to make a story work; without having the type of story climax involving EVERYTHING bad happening. Stories that can do that succesfully to me are special, but the overall is an eight because I feel that the story takes a turn for the (rather) dark too quickly and into a place that could have been set up a bit better.

After confessing his love to Ryouko, the scopophobic Morino Ryoushi (Irino, Miyu) is recruited as the 8th member of the Otagi Bank by Ryouko’s closest friend Akai Ringo (Itou, Kanae), The story’s narrator (Arai, Satomi) often badmouths the characters and interjects her own thoughts as the show progresses, sometimes causing the characters to break the 4th wall. Ryoushi tries...to get closer Ryouko as he, along with the rest of the Otagi Bank, helps other students through their dilemmas.[Characters]:The characters in Ookami-san are a good place to start because I think they are one of the show’s strongest points. While the show’s title speaks to only Ryouko’s seven friends in the Otagi Bank, the cast is much larger than this – mostly comprised of other students from Otagi High but not exclusively.The eponymous Ookami Ryouko is fierce and somewhat cold to others at face-value however it is quickly elaborated upon that this is an attitude she has adopted and that she is actually more shy and caring underneath her exterior. This is the primary trait that leads Morino Ryoushi to fall in love with her and the integrity of this demeanor makes up a good amount of the show’s drama as Ryouko’s past is explored and her current lifestyle disrupted. I love her character design and, as many would point out, she is highly reminiscent of Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! (along with the fact that they are both tsundere).On the topic of her design and of her name – Ookami-san does something quite interesting concerning the characterization of its cast. Many of the characters both inside and outside of the Otagi bank have light references to fairy tales and the like most prevalently featured being references to Aesop’s Fables). Because of this, along with its energetic, fourth-wall-breaking narrator, the show is often mislabeled as a parody of sorts however I would say that the references are not made to such a degree that anyone would miss anything about the show if they were not familiar with the source materials; the character references are a bonus. A few examples of this are Ookami’s wolf-like persona and occasional pointed tooth, Akai Ringo’s red hair and outfit reference Little Red Riding Hood (she is also a reference to the apple in Snow White), and Hitsujikai Shirou is a reference to The Boy Who Cried Wolf – insinuating that he lies. There are some interesting parallels the show draws with these references however they are of no ultimately great import to the show and make up only a small amount of the characterization – the show takes these characters and traits and makes them its own.To quickly go over Ryoushi, he is a shy and timid character, mostly due to his scopophobia however when the stakes are high or when Ryouko needs his help he steps up to the plate and becomes an immensely more enjoyable character. His scopophobia is more present in the first half of the show than the later half and part of this is brushed off as development however it appears quite randomly as a gag and I think was one of the few comedic elements that could have been executed better within the show.The other characters, and there are many, are all very interesting – each with their own distinct personalities, designs, and sometimes references that make the large cast and their interactions with each other quite pleasurable.[Art/Animation]:I was very pleased with the art and animation of Ookami-san as I felt it exemplified the things that J.C. Staff does best. The animation itself was very reminiscent of other J.C. projects such as Toradora!, Toaru Majutsu no Index, and Shigofumi which I am a complete sucker for. The fight scenes, and there are a surprising number of them given the show’s premise, are very well done and are good action for a show that otherwise busies itself with comedy and drama. There are more of these scenes at the beginning than at the end however there is a good final fight in relation to this and so the action element of the show never feels to be completely missing.There is also a lot of interesting work being done with the character designs as many of their elements go hand-in-hand with their the characters story-tale references. Additionally, I like that Morimo’s design is rather bland in comparison to some of the more outlandishly designed characters like Majolica le Fay – this approach makes him feel like a bit more of an outsider in comparison to the rest of the Otagi Bank and serves as a stark contrast for when he gets fired up, revealing his oft hidden eye(s). Along with the actual characterization of the cast of Ookami-san, I would say their designs are its other strong point as I really enjoyed them.[Story]:The primary story, which involves Ookami Ryouko’s past as well as her current relationship with Ryoushi makes up about half the show whereas the other half follows the premise quite closely in that the Otagi Bank addresses the needs of other students or the members of the bank themselves. Because of this the ‘story’ is not really the meat of the show but rather an interesting yet irregularly recurring feature. The show focuses primarily on Ryoushi and Ryouko’s dynamic, often comically, and then on the activities of the Otagi Bank and its members. The show does arrive at a climax of sorts in relation to the ‘main story-line’ however does not truly resolve everything and as there is no secondary installment into the series the show is left a bit open-ended which somewhat hurts it.[Music]:The music was not a negative aspect of the show as it did not actively detract from anything however I would also say it was not a plus as it felt extremely background oriented and didn't attempt to ever win out over the action or the drama. This is not a good or bad thing, it is simply an approach – one which worked perfectly fine for this show. Nothing much to make note of in this category; there is nothing here that would cause me to recommend the show based on its soundtrack.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Ookami-san is a really fun show with a lot of stuff going on inside of it but the main story leaves something to be desired. Not because its presentation was lackluster but because it fails to resolve what it brings up and because I wish there was more of it – the show simply wasn't long enough for it to do everything it wanted/needed to which is always an unfortunate shortcoming.I would best sum up the show as something that doesn't overly commit to any of its genres but does well enough in each of them to be enjoyable respectively.Rating: 6I gave Ookami-san a 6 because, while it was a really fun show in its characterization and its aesthetics, the comedy was only mediocre and there wasn't enough of the decent drama that the show had to have felt committal.[Recommendations]:I would recommend Ookami-san to fans of J.C. Staff first and foremost. If you enjoyed some of their other big titles at least in part for their animation, then this show is another good place to enjoy a similar style. People that enjoy references to fairy tales or perhaps the most avid fans of Into the Woods would get a kick out of the playful character and plot allusions brought up in the show. Ookami-san has a few good, short bursts of action and has decent comedy but nothing excellent in that regard. The drama, while intermittent, feels pretty real when it shows up and Ryouko’s trauma is very well presented. to get closer Ryouko as he, along with the rest of the Otagi Bank, helps other students through their dilemmas.[Characters]:The characters in Ookami-san are a good place to start because I think they are one of the show’s strongest points. While the show’s title speaks to only Ryouko’s seven friends in the Otagi Bank, the cast is much larger than this – mostly comprised of other students from Otagi High but not exclusively.The eponymous Ookami Ryouko is fierce and somewhat cold to others at face-value however it is quickly elaborated upon that this is an attitude she has adopted and that she is actually more shy and caring underneath her exterior. This is the primary trait that leads Morino Ryoushi to fall in love with her and the integrity of this demeanor makes up a good amount of the show’s drama as Ryouko’s past is explored and her current lifestyle disrupted. I love her character design and, as many would point out, she is highly reminiscent of Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! (along with the fact that they are both tsundere).On the topic of her design and of her name – Ookami-san does something quite interesting concerning the characterization of its cast. Many of the characters both inside and outside of the Otagi bank have light references to fairy tales and the like most prevalently featured being references to Aesop’s Fables).

There is some romance, but not enough to really enjoy beyond the comedy of the romance itself. "", ""TIP: KEEP WATCHING AFTER THE ENDING MUSIC, THEIR IS MORE IN THE EPISODE AND SOMETIMES WILL CONFUSE YOU IF YOU DON'T WATCH IT, AND THEN THEY'LL BRING IT UP IN THE NEXT EPISODE!!!Ok so I am horrible at writing reviews. I honestly am, but for Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi it was love at first sight! The story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, and overall is a 10, 100% amazing. The only tiny little down part is there is a narrator sometimes, and she could be a tad annoying. Nonetheless, it's my new favorite anime, I finished in a day. It's only 12 episodes sadly, and...I thought there was more. I Wasn't paying attention to the amount of episodes. The less the episodes the better the anime plot! But still, I honestly feel like crying, because it gives you feels (sometimes) it gives you drama, romance, and comedy! Each character has his/her unique trait related to their creative arc. I honestly believe you MUST watch this, or forever hold your piece. I have no idea how this anime isn't as well known, and want more people to watch it. It certainly keeps you in your seat!

Finally to all those who are delaying watching this plz just ""Go For It""  ya the no progerss of the main couple would be a disappointment without her..nah...it won\'t be fun...  Finally to all those who are delaying watching this plz just ""Go For It""  ya the no progerss of the main couple would be a disappointment', 'Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi is the kind of anime where you\'ll quite enjoy it in your free time, and probably this is what this anime meant to be. Honestly, this anime is average as its best but they really and seriously had a chance to make it decent and unfortunately they failed to deliver it to make it great. The concept is relative mainstream but consider it\'s 2010 anime, i am not sure it\'s bad idea at all, and the story...yup the weakest part of this anime. So let\'s begin with this review for every aspects:-Maybe i unintentionally to give some spoilers, so spoilers...alert-(Story)= 5Well like i said before, this is the most underwhelming part and aspect for this anime. Let\'s take a look from the main focus of this anime, there is a tsundere girl called Ookami Ryouko who have been trying for getting stronger and stronger so she can\' protect herself without the helps from others because from what she experienced in her ""dark"" past, but guess what in highschool she then suddenly joined with this Bank Otogi without any explanations why she can joined. I mean, she tried to avoid any contacts from people (except Ringo who the only person she can trusts) but the way they never explained it bothered me a little. And then suddenly there is this ""stalker"" called Ryoushi-kun appears nowhere and confess if he loves her just because personally for me a weak reason why he can love her, and then he says will do anything to be in her side (a little bit cliche here). Well as you can see, there are a lot ordinary progress that happen toward the story, but the problem is actually: there is no actual or big progresses at all!!!! I mean, from episode 1-8, people are gonna expecting something bigger gonna happen that can influence both of them to be more closer or a big event who can drive the story to be more creative and awesome, and yes there are some small events happen there, but the impacts aren\'t that much from what we expect. I won\'t gonna spoiling more so that\'s the best i can tell to you about the summary of story in the anime.(Art)=8This is the best aspect of the anime for me. The animation is decent enough, and the quality isn\'t bad at all, i mean it\'s 2010 anime so with this animation they actually did a pretty good job for it. The character designs also aren\'t bad although some of them are pretty weird and mainstream, like this Ryoushi-kun is the type of main character that you\'ll forget easily, or Ookami herself who look like Aisaka Taiga 2.0 (with more height, but still no boobs lol), and the antagonist Hitsujikai who looks pretty edgy for me. But overall, this aspect is good.(Sound)=6Kinda meh except the voices acting especially the narrator who i like so much, but the music and soundtracks aren\'t going to be in my favorite and i am not bothering to skip every opening and ending for every episode of the anime.(Character)=6I honestly not really like Ookami at all because actually i am tired of the tsundere character, and this girl is kind of the extreme one. Sometimes i just want her to stop, i mean seriously like stop for acting like a bitch and yes it annoys me a lot, and don\'t forget the mainstream part she always punches and blames main character even he does nothing, i am pretty sure no one likes this type of cliche right. And her character, yup so complicated, for comparison Aisaka Taiga is also an extreme tsundere but at least she tried to be honest about herself to the person she loves but this Ookami, no...she never even tried how to get close with the persons she cares instead everyone right there who always do it for her especially the main character, but guess what? he always ends up with a punch on his face smh. I know it\'s a 2010 anime, but even then i still can\'t stand with this tsundere heroine. And then the mc Ryoushi-kun, who actually has the character developments in this anime, but unfortunately like i said, he isn\'t so special and doesn\'t have any great appeal at all, you\'ll so easy to forget him anytime soon. And the antagonist of this anime is terrible, i don\'t get his motives at all because they all are so unclear, why he suddenly becomes the student council chairman in rival school? where he have been before? what his actual motive to do that? we\'ll never know because the anime failed to tell us clearly about it. Besides that, most of the side characters are pretty interesting and good, so this one really saves this aspect for me to this anime.(Enjoyment)=7Regardless from the negative opinions i give towards this anime, i\'ll be honest if i actually enjoy it a lot because i just like the anime who using a school setting as their genre, and if you\'re like me so i am sure you\'ll like it too, at least to fill your free time.(Overall)=7Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi is an average anime, not great but also not really bad at all so if you like the anime with the tsundere heroine as its focus, and school setting with actions as its genre, i can recommend it to you but don\'t expect it too much for the progresses or anything, because that\'s the part where this anime failed to deliver.. alert-(Story)= 5Well like i said before, this is the most underwhelming part and aspect for this anime.

Something to pass the time with and it' s rather enjoyable. It provides decent action, comedy. and romance., although it could have been better. The main thing that I disliked about this anime was the narrator that would not shut up! Even while characters are speaking, it gets annoying fast. Sometimes the narrator would make a funny comment but it was just pointless in having a narrator at all. Overall it's a good anime and I recommend it if you don't have anything else better to watch. "", ""Truth be told, the only hook I was given while being dragged in to watching this anime was that the male protagonist speaks like a Prinny.  After finally finding some time, I sat down and watched the whole series.Now the start looked very promising.  We are introduced to our bumbling male lead and the apple of his eye, the titular Ookami-san.  A few episodes later introduces the rest of the members of the Otogi Bank before seguing in to an ominous shadow.  Now at this point, the story gets switches rapidly between the ominous Onigashi thread, the characters and reinserting some...light-heartedness back in to the mix for variety.  It isn't that horrible a mess but I find the pacing off.  That aside it even leaves the main conflict between our leads and their antagonists unsatisfactorily resolved.  A real shame but it may have more to do with the short nature of series (ie it is only 12 episodes long).The animation however is constant in quality despite the number of action scenes worked in.  Funnily enough, it also runs the gamut in terms of variety, showing off serious situations and slapstick comedy with equal attention to both without taking anything away from the scenes.  Solid showing.Props as well to the sound, and one of the few times a voice actor really does make the show better for me.  More specifically, the lemony narrator as voiced by Satomi Arai.  That's not to say the sound falls short in the other departments.  The background music shows variety to accompany the various scenes and supplements the art well.  Especially when some damn heroic stunts need to pulled off and succeed, set to the tune of the opening no less.  What mars this good sound direction are the sound effects.  There is one grating flaw and it is that damn meow sound effect used by the Neko Knuckles.  Of course that's some would no doubt find it funny that a punch is masked or glossed over by it but it really really bothers me.In terms of character I say the effort put in is adequate.  Here as well, variety is a watchword.  We are treated to our expected stereotypical characters and then there are those that evolve as the show runs its course.  Mostly its our male lead, which I find pleasingly not stuck with his neuroses and weaknesses and who moves forward.Which brings me to the end of my musings.  I'm a sucker for lemony narration though and this one is really well done, which is why I was laughing most of the time when it was twisting well known fairy tales with the fight scenes alleviating the boredom when humour could not.  I can't say Ookami-san is a bad anime though but it wouldn't be the first thing I recommend this season.  Give it a try and see for yourself. light-heartedness back in to the mix for variety.

My fault that I watched this anime while setting my mind that I would take this anime's plot seriously.And Because of that, I am depressing myself over the fact that this anime sucks in so many ways. The typical tsundere loli? The typical passive protagonist? Here are the reasons why I', frustrated after finishing this anime.1.What annoyed me the most is the narrator. Yeah. The narrator. She constantly interrupts the scene and leave me frustrated enough to slam my head onto the keyboard. I can't pay...attention to what the characters are saying because of this stupid shit narrating that interrupts even at an important points.2.Development. There are not even a tiny bit of development between the characters. Oh yeah. there is. Ryoushi and Ryouka are a little bit closer than before. Ryouka finally acknowledges that Ryoushi is a man capable of protecting her. About the other characters? They are as the same as when you're first introduced to them.3. The plot. there are no closure to this anime. Well not that I expected a full closure but at least you could give a gist of what will happen at the end of the story. But NO. Fuck that. Lets leave all the audience wondering what will happen to them, even after this anime end in this season. Even the fight between Ryoushi and Hitsujikai Shirou is barely started, and yet unfortunately its at the 11th episode already, almost the end of the season.ahhhh..lets stop this. I'm sorry guys. I know that this anime shouldn't be taken seriously.Even the producer of this anime didn't take this seriously. We should actually watch this anime and laugh by its comedy, but I can't. I'm annoyed with the narrator, the plot goes into drain, and the characters didn't even develop a bit, whats left? An eye candy art? Yeah that's forgivable. The art is still good enough for me. Reminding me of Toradora. Maybe it can be repaired with a 2nd season. But no. This kind of shit should be stopped.For those who want to watch this, set your mind right. If you want to indulge yourself into a serious anime with a deep storyline, avoid this. but if you just want to laugh your ass off and watch a light anime, without questioning the plot and how the producer put a closure to this anime, maybe this is the one for you.Oh, and I gave this anime a 6 right. That is only because of the art, and apparently I had a good laugh in some moments. attention to what the characters are saying because of this stupid shit narrating that interrupts even at an important points.2.Development.

The motives of the main villain is never explored and nothing is actually resolved with the conflict as both sides are exactly where they start out at by the end of it. That would what you'd expect out a terrible show but there is still a bit there if you are really digging which people take the chance to cling onto. However, if...you are watching for the story, this might be one of the worst show you could watch as it will leave you wondering why did any of it even happen once you finish it.The general tone of the show regarding Art, Sound and Characters are what you'd expect and overall quite generic. The tsundere female MC, the shy but nice male MC, the cute and protective friend of female MC and a cast of somewhat generic anime tropes as background characters. All this glued together with references to popular fairy tales. All of this makes for an average school anime with a slight twist. 6/10 material right there, 5/10 for the terrible story right?All except for how much enjoyment I got out of the parody elements of the show. The whole show makes a lot more sense if you don't take it at face value and just feel how well the tropes are played. The evil school with the evil people are evil because the show needs conflict, they even tell you this in one of the episodes. The whole plot is a cheesy mess just because it's not important. The character dialog is often covered up by the 4th-wall breaking narrator because it's not important. It's all just there because it has to be. It is only uses it as a way to put the characters in situations where you can get their interactions.The show was quite an enjoyable sitcom and the tropes played are enjoyable if you aren't super serious about it. The way the characters play off each other in situations are both fun and funny. That is what made the anime worth watching. It knows why a lot of comedies like this are funny and it makes a joke of the other aspects of some shows like this.One thing that this show does however seems to be that it is way too subtle with some of these parody elements. I feel like there is a joke there about why the kids never go to the adults but the reasoning is just be the kids don't want to worry the adults which is a joke in itself but they could have done a lot more to emphasize it. Thing like this could be played a lot more openly. This makes it harder to tell when the show is actually joking or just bad. This doesn't bother me too much but I can see a lot of people missing it as a joke, if it was intended as one.

"", 'Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi is an overall okay anime, not the greatest but not the worst. Long review ahead and is generally spoiler free.StoryThe story is like your standard highschool romance comedy. But unlike most highschool romance comedies, there is an actual villain - Hitsujikai. His and Ookami Ryouko\'s past is what makes the show more interesting. Each episode has underlying fairy tale references which are interesting and well executed.The story does have flaws too. Some of the episodes are quite strong. For example, my favourite episode - Episode 9 where Shirayuki-senpai and Akai Ringo\'s past is shown is one of the...strong points in the story. It adds to Ringo\'s character and makes her more developed and takes away the impression that she is just Ookami Ryouko\'s sidekick.While there are good episodes, there are some episodes that serve no purpose and are a waste of time. Episode 8 was probably one of the worst episodes in my opinion. The two characters - the butler and Chutaro Nezumi were annoying (Chutaro being your stereotypical rich brat and the butler with his weird and crass jokes -__- ) and the whole episode was pointless and I see it as wasted twenty minutes and money to make one dumb episode.The ending in my opinion was rather unsatisfying. (No spoilers)ArtThe art was okay, not too shabby. I liked the character designs. If you have noticed, the show has references to fairy tales and Japanese folk tales. You can tell from the design of the character. However, I find Morino Ryoushi\'s design rather bland in comparison to crazier characters such as Majolica le Fay. The animation was consistent throughout.SoundThe voice actors did a good job with the voicing of the characters and conveyed the emotions of the characters well. The background music consisted of the continuous re-use of the opening, this irritated me. The show is reliant on the narrator. Although it is good to have a narrator who could help make things clearer for the viewer and help them understand the story better, the narration is too much for me because they should give the viewers some space to think instead of having the narrator\'s voice going on and on.CharacterThe main characters are reasonably well developed.Ookami Ryouko is a strong, manly girl with a tsundere attitude. However, she goes beyond the one-sided tsundere. She has a hidden self that no one really knows and is much softer on the inside. Ookami seems real and I can somewhat reach out to her. I find her relateable, compared to other anime heroines.The male lead, Morino Ryoushi was probably one of the more dynamic characters. From a quiet boy with a scopophobia (anxiety disorder that is characterized by the fear of being looked at), he transforms into a braver person who is able to stand up for his friends due to his crush on Ookami Ryouko. Both of them make a decent couple in my opinion.Akai Ringo is Ookami Ryouko\'s best friend. She seems to be a happy-go-lucky loli character. However, she is not a typical loli and is rather tricky. Kudos to breaking the stereotype!The supporting cast had a lot of people. Other than the ones part of the Otogi Bank such as Alice and Majolica, the side characters are less memorable and do not leave any impression on me. Some of the characters were plain awful such as the butler or the rich kid from Episode 8. I wished it cut down on fan-service and maybe reduce the number of side characters. As the saying goes, ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"".EnjoymentOokami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi is not particularly memorable but I would gladly rewatch it just for the laughs. I like the animation and characters the most. Perhaps the show would be better if the plot was improved.In conclusion, I\'ll give the show a 7/10. It is not too bad and I recommend it to teenagers. It is light-hearted and sadly, has untapped potential.

I’m your host, Naru the Narcissist, and... You know what? People make mistakes for a reason. It’s not just so we can learn from them, but so that we can teach other people about them, too. And today, I’ve decided to educate all of you about a mistake that I made recently, and on that note, this is my review of Okami-san and her Seven Companions.Ryoko Okami is a sixteen year old student, who goes to the very prestigious Otogi High School. She has a strong sense of justice, and is always ready and willing to...throw her all into a fight in order to protect herself and others. This admirable toughness, along with her generosity and benevolence towards those weaker than her, serve her very well in the Otogi Bank, a school club that does favors for people in exchange for returned favors down the road.She often works with her best friend and room mate, Akai Ringo, a girl who’s sweet and charming on the outside but cunning and manipulative on the inside. Together, this team of Wolf and Red strike terror into the hearts of the wicked... All of whom look like stereotypical anime punks.One day, as they’re walking home from a mission, a mysterious boy from their class follows them, and proclaims his love for Ryoko! His name is Morino Ryoushi, a boy who’s bold in tongue but shy at heart, who gets terrified whenever somebody stares at him. But only if they think the word ‘staaaaaaaare’ while they’re doing it. With his ability to seemlessly blend into a crowd, he gets recruited into Otogi Bank, and now, the three have to continue working together! Well, that’s the set-up... I’ll save the plot for later, because hoo boy.For now, Okami-san was produced by JC Staff, the people who produced Index and Toradora, and to say that it’s a step down would be putting it nicely. For those who don't remember it, the animation in Toradora could occasionally look cheap and clunky, like a sketchy pen-and-ink design that isn’t quite finished. There are quite a few shows that default to this style once or twice in order to stretch their budgets, like Samurai Seven and Welcome to the NHK. It’s ugly, but taken in small doses, it’s not the worst thing in the world. Well, Okami-san is presented entirely in this style, from beginning to end, and it’s incredibly difficult to get used to. The backgrounds and landscapes are amazing, but in regards to the characters... It’s like K-ON, but a few drafts shy of the final draft.The dub isn’t terrible either, but we are unfortunately dealing with a Jamie Marchi script, and like usual, I can tell it’s her within the first half of episode one. Have you ever had a weird aunt who tries to look cool by saying all the hip slangy stuff that she thinks your generation will be able to relate to, even though she just comes off as ironically charming at best? That’s Jamie Marchi. Thankfully, she shares duties with Chuck Huber, so it’s not as bad as it could have been.Joel McDonald plays Ryoushi as earnestly as possible, doing a great job in making him likeable. Monica Rial seems to have a great understanding of her character, as she’s able to play every shade of her personality believably. Oddly enough, the one who falls flat is Brina Palencia, who would normally be one of my favorites. I’m going to chalk this up to bad casting, because she never really seems to own this particular character.The most depressing part of the dub is Luci Christian, whom I have come to consider the queen of voice acting. Whom I would sell a kidney to meet in person. She plays the part of the narrator, who’s job extends far past the intros and outros that you’d expect her to voice. No, she’s present through the entire show, talking our ear off the whole time. She dumps exposition on us, makes rude comments about the characters and their bodies, she drowns out the dialogue, and basically struggles to find some sort of a point for her own existence. Luci tries to make this character interesting, but even with her behind the wheel, I haven’t heard narration this pointless, cruel and infuriating since Pitch Perfect.So, I didn’t want to go into the plot earlier, and for my reason? Well, the plot of this show is an extensive point of discussion all it’s own. This is the basic plot, in a nutshell... Ryoko is only pretending to be strong, but she’s actually scared and girl on the inside, and it’s Ryoushi’s job to warm her icy heart and turn her back to her normal girly self, so that he can be strong for her instead.The term ‘sexist’ gets thrown around a lot, but when the plot of an anime boils directly down to ‘woman not really strong, let man be strong for you,’ that’s a pretty big red flag, particularly when it has to remind you over and over again that the main character isn’t actually strong. Yeah, I’m sorry, was she just duking it out in a street fight with several armed older men? Was she just putting on a brave face while a much larger group of them took her down and attempted to violate her? And she’s not strong because she’s afraid and only pretending to be strong? Because she likes puppies and girly novels? Do I even have to point out the layers of bullshit at play here?Sorry, but fearless bravery isn’t real bravery, it’s just stupid recklessness. Being scared but doing the right thing anyway is true courage. The Olson Twins’ made for TV Halloween movie taught me that when I was a child, and this show still has a tough time understanding it.Oh wait, there’s an explanation for it. She pretends to be tough because she got violated by somebody in middle school, but when she tried to report it, nobody believed her, and everybody started to hate her for lying. There’s a certain nuance to that... She’s scared and distrustful because she was violated and never vindicated for it, but she acts tough because she doesn’t want it to happen again. Her best friend wants to set her up with a good man so she can slowly undo the damage that was done to her. Makes sense, right?Well, ignoring the troubling implications that this idea makes in regards to the creator’s opinions towards women, I have to ask... Why am I supposed to want to see this change happen? What do I, as the viewer, get out of it?Okay, for the sake of comparison, let’s talk about Batman for a moment. Yes, I know, they have nothing in common... Ryoko became a kick-ass vigilante because something traumatic happened to her in the past, while Bruce Wayne became a kick-ass vigilante because... Okay, maybe they’re not that different. Well, Batman’s backstory is so well known that every single incarnation of his story has explored it at some point... Except for Brave and the Bold during daytime hours, because we must censor to protect the children... and it ties in perfectly with the development that happens down the road.Now, I’m not the first person to suggest this, but it would be very healthy for Bruce Wayne to just get over his parents’ death and give up the crime fighting. He could put aside his cape and cowl, and just live life as the wealthy philanthropist playboy he was born to be. find a good woman, start a family, and live the American dream.So, if it would be in his best interest, why doesn’t it happen? Because if it did, nobody would care anymore. The fanbase would die off, and the only readers left would be the ones holding onto the hope that it’s just some sick dream created by The Mad Hatter.Similarly, seeing Ryoko giving up on her quest for justice would take away what is, frankly, the only interesting thing about her. Without it, she’s just another generic Tsundere, like Naru from Love Hina. She is not my namesake. And yet, her best friends... And some viewers as well... want to see this development happen. Apparently it’s okay for a grown man in a black suit to dedicate his life to being strong and kicking ass, but a teenaged high school girl? Work through that shit!And here’s my biggest problem with this show. Bigger than my problem with the narrator, or with Marchi’s writing. Remember Ryoko’s best friend, Ringo? These two didn’t meet until a year after Ryoko’s assault. The person Ringo met is, through and through, the very damaged tomboy she’s trying to change. I’m sorry, but if you think that friendship is trying to change somebody into a better person that you think they can become, you’re not a very good friend.Back in March, I wrote a review on my blog about a little anime called Oreimo, a title that is more or less the shortened version of ‘My Little Sister Can’t Possibly be this Cute.’ Guess what it’s about. But despite all of it’s shortcomings, I praised Oreimo for having a cast of characters that make the effort to try and understand and accept each other for who they are. At least, in the first season.And now, you expect me to be entertained by some bullshit series where an awesome character’s best friend wants to hook her up with a man so she’ll be more ladylike? And you’re going to look me in the eye and tell me that Okami-san is popular, but Oreimo is despised by people? Are you fucking kidding me? Oreimo’s writing was great until the 2013 revival, but Okamisan’s writing was bad right out of the gate!For the first six episodes or so, I didn’t mind this show. The chauvinism goes pretty deep, but it was kind of funny a few times, it was mostly harmless, and the annoying narrator was at least making one or two good jokes.It was at about the halfway point that the low quality of the writing really started to overpower what little good there may have been. It tries to do both comedy and drama, but it never succeeds in creating a balance between the two. It can actually be pretty damn jarring at times. To summarize, Okami-san tries to go to some really serious places while struggling to take itself seriously. They even manage to work ecchi undertones into a CPR scene, for Christ’s sake! After seeing what Ouran High School Host Club was capable of, no anime should ever have an excuse to blend comedy and drama this poorly!There are too many characters, and the ones that we get to spend time with normally only get a single episode dedicated to them before they fade back into the background. The narrator wears out her welcome fast, and doesn’t tell nearly enough funny jokes to justify her presence.And if that’s not bad enough, this show actually seems to be terrified of itself. We never see the Otogi Bank actually pursuing a debt, because it’s terrified of making the characters look unlikeable. The constant fairy tale references never really amount to anything, because it’s terrified of not being taken seriously. We never find out exactly what happened to Ryoko in middle school, because it’s terrified of upsetting the audience. We never see Ryoushi asking her out on an actual date, because it’s terrified of exploring how such an exaggerated character would react to normal social interactions. The narrator won’t shut the hell up, because it’s scared that the writing won’t hold up on it’s own.The writing in general, is really, really bad. It constantly alternates between being insultingly stupid and just plain boring. The amnesia storyline alone is an episode painful enough to skip. The episode where a butler tries to find a bride for his ward is even worse, as he uses it as an excuse to make shallow, despicable remarks about the entire female cast before revealing that he didn’t need to be there in the first place. At no point do the characters ever act like real people.And the ending... You know what? Throw up a spoiler tag, because I really fucking need to address this. At the end of the series, a rival school... The respective hell to their heaven... kidnaps several main characters, and just to make things more personal, Ryoko is kidnapped and held hostage by the very man who allegedly did something violation-y to her. I won’t tell you how this is resolved, but I’ll sure as hell tell you how it isn’t resolved. Despite the clear cases of assault and abduction... and others, I’m sure... Nobody calls the cops. Who definitely exist in this universe. Would it be anticlimactic, like the end of Monty Python and the holy Grail? No, because Ryoko is being held captive by the very man who got away cleanly with something vague to her. Yeah, it doesn’t take Dick Tracey to look at this scenario and start wondering if she’d been telling the truth back then.For the non-spoiler version... The main villain, who is introduced with a promising bang, ultimately fades out with an anticlimactic whimper, promising revenge for a sequel series that will hopefully never come. Hell, that’s pretty much how the series ends as a whole… Nothing is resolved, and early implications about the village being part of a social experiment filled with fairy tale references amounts to absolutely nothing. I know it’s easy to say that someone couldn’t write their way out of a paper bag, but it really does seem like somebody deliberately was trying to do just that... And failing miserably at it.Strictly speaking, Okami-san isn’t the worst anime I’ve ever seen. It’s not even on my bottom ten. But you know what? I still hate it. I don’t even hate the anime I once gave 0/10, but I hate this anime. And trust me, there’s a very, very small list of anime that I flat-out hate. It’s bad enough that it’s stupid, full of shit, and blatantly sexist, but the way it approaches the subject of rape just tips the scales entirely against it.I haven’t seen every anime, so I could be wrong about this, but outside of hentai, rape is a subject that doesn’t exist in the medium. It can be joked about, or threatened, but it doesn’t actually happen, and it doesn’t get dealt with. This is one of the reasons that Now and Then, Here and There is such a rare gem… Any anime that introduces a plot point about one of it’s characters being raped, and actually explores the repercussions and recovery of the attack, can easily be considered a ground breaking series. What frustrates me the most about Okami-san is that by introducing the rape implications in a lazy attempt to explain Ryoko’s character, they actually come really close to pulling this off… Only to pussy out at every turn. They vaguely introduce the subject when needed, then drop it cold and try to make us forget about it until the next time it’s needed. I know it isn’t fair of me to whole-heartedly condemn this series because of what I wanted it to be, rather than what it was, but what it was was no peach, okay?Okami-san and her Seven Companions was dubbed by Funimation, and can be viewed for free on Netflix. You can also find a lot of other anime on Netflix that don’t suck, so don’t even bother with this festering field full of fairy tale feces. It isn’t well written, it isn’t well produced... It just isn’t well. I gave it a four out of ten the first time I watched it, but now that I’ve watched it twice, I think it’s much more appropriate to give this series a 2/10. throw her all into a fight in order to protect herself and others.

For those who don't remember it, the animation in Toradora could occasionally look cheap and clunky, like a sketchy pen-and-ink design that isn’t quite finished. There are quite a few shows that default to this style once or twice in order to stretch their budgets, like Samurai Seven and Welcome to the NHK. It’s ugly, but taken in small doses, it’s not the worst thing in the world. Well, Okami-san is presented entirely in this style, from beginning to end, and it’s incredibly difficult to get used to. The backgrounds and landscapes are amazing, but in regards to the characters... It’s like K-ON, but a few drafts shy of the final draft.The dub isn’t terrible either, but we are unfortunately dealing with a Jamie Marchi script, and like usual, I can tell it’s her within the first half of episode one. Have you ever had a weird aunt who tries to look cool by saying all the hip slangy stuff that she thinks your generation will be able to relate to, even though she just comes off as ironically charming at best? That’s Jamie Marchi. Thankfully, she shares duties with Chuck Huber, so it’s not as bad as it could have been.Joel McDonald plays Ryoushi as earnestly as possible, doing a great job in making him likeable. Monica Rial seems to have a great understanding of her character, as she’s able to play every shade of her personality believably. Oddly enough, the one who falls flat is Brina Palencia, who would normally be one of my favorites. I’m going to chalk this up to bad casting, because she never really seems to own this particular character.The most depressing part of the dub is Luci Christian, whom I have come to consider the queen of voice acting. Whom I would sell a kidney to meet in person. She plays the part of the narrator, who’s job extends far past the intros and outros that you’d expect her to voice. No, she’s present through the entire show, talking our ear off the whole time. She dumps exposition on us, makes rude comments about the characters and their bodies, she drowns out the dialogue, and basically struggles to find some sort of a point for her own existence. Luci tries to make this character interesting, but even with her behind the wheel, I haven’t heard narration this pointless, cruel and infuriating since Pitch Perfect.So, I didn’t want to go into the plot earlier, and for my reason? Well, the plot of this show is an extensive point of discussion all it’s own. This is the basic plot, in a nutshell... Ryoko is only pretending to be strong, but she’s actually scared and girl on the inside, and it’s Ryoushi’s job to warm her icy heart and turn her back to her normal girly self, so that he can be strong for her instead.The term ‘sexist’ gets thrown around a lot, but when the plot of an anime boils directly down to ‘woman not really strong, let man be strong for you,’ that’s a pretty big red flag, particularly when it has to remind you over and over again that the main character isn’t actually strong. Yeah, I’m sorry, was she just duking it out in a street fight with several armed older men? Was she just putting on a brave face while a much larger group of them took her down and attempted to violate her? And she’s not strong because she’s afraid and only pretending to be strong? Because she likes puppies and girly novels? Do I even have to point out the layers of bullshit at play here?Sorry, but fearless bravery isn’t real bravery, it’s just stupid recklessness. Being scared but doing the right thing anyway is true courage. The Olson Twins’ made for TV Halloween movie taught me that when I was a child, and this show still has a tough time understanding it.Oh wait, there’s an explanation for it. She pretends to be tough because she got violated by somebody in middle school, but when she tried to report it, nobody believed her, and everybody started to hate her for lying. There’s a certain nuance to that... She’s scared and distrustful because she was violated and never vindicated for it, but she acts tough because she doesn’t want it to happen again. Her best friend wants to set her up with a good man so she can slowly undo the damage that was done to her. Makes sense, right?Well, ignoring the troubling implications that this idea makes in regards to the creator’s opinions towards women, I have to ask... Why am I supposed to want to see this change happen? What do I, as the viewer, get out of it?Okay, for the sake of comparison, let’s talk about Batman for a moment. Yes, I know, they have nothing in common... Ryoko became a kick-ass vigilante because something traumatic happened to her in the past, while Bruce Wayne became a kick-ass vigilante because... Okay, maybe they’re not that different. Well, Batman’s backstory is so well known that every single incarnation of his story has explored it at some point... Except for Brave and the Bold during daytime hours, because we must censor to protect the children... and it ties in perfectly with the development that happens down the road.Now, I’m not the first person to suggest this, but it would be very healthy for Bruce Wayne to just get over his parents’ death and give up the crime fighting. He could put aside his cape and cowl, and just live life as the wealthy philanthropist playboy he was born to be. find a good woman, start a family, and live the American dream.So, if it would be in his best interest, why doesn’t it happen? Because if it did, nobody would care anymore. The fanbase would die off, and the only readers left would be the ones holding onto the hope that it’s just some sick dream created by The Mad Hatter.Similarly, seeing Ryoko giving up on her quest for justice would take away what is, frankly, the only interesting thing about her. Without it, she’s just another generic Tsundere, like Naru from Love Hina. She is not my namesake. And yet, her best friends... And some viewers as well... want to see this development happen. Apparently it’s okay for a grown man in a black suit to dedicate his life to being strong and kicking ass, but a teenaged high school girl? Work through that shit!And here’s my biggest problem with this show. Bigger than my problem with the narrator, or with Marchi’s writing. Remember Ryoko’s best friend, Ringo? These two didn’t meet until a year after Ryoko’s assault. The person Ringo met is, through and through, the very damaged tomboy she’s trying to change. I’m sorry, but if you think that friendship is trying to change somebody into a better person that you think they can become, you’re not a very good friend.Back in March, I wrote a review on my blog about a little anime called Oreimo, a title that is more or less the shortened version of ‘My Little Sister Can’t Possibly be this Cute.’ Guess what it’s about. But despite all of it’s shortcomings, I praised Oreimo for having a cast of characters that make the effort to try and understand and accept each other for who they are. At least, in the first season.And now, you expect me to be entertained by some bullshit series where an awesome character’s best friend wants to hook her up with a man so she’ll be more ladylike? And you’re going to look me in the eye and tell me that Okami-san is popular, but Oreimo is despised by people? Are you fucking kidding me? Oreimo’s writing was great until the 2013 revival, but Okamisan’s writing was bad right out of the gate!For the first six episodes or so, I didn’t mind this show. The chauvinism goes pretty deep, but it was kind of funny a few times, it was mostly harmless, and the annoying narrator was at least making one or two good jokes.It was at about the halfway point that the low quality of the writing really started to overpower what little good there may have been. It tries to do both comedy and drama, but it never succeeds in creating a balance between the two. It can actually be pretty damn jarring at times. To summarize, Okami-san tries to go to some really serious places while struggling to take itself seriously. They even manage to work ecchi undertones into a CPR scene, for Christ’s sake! After seeing what Ouran High School Host Club was capable of, no anime should ever have an excuse to blend comedy and drama this poorly!There are too many characters, and the ones that we get to spend time with normally only get a single episode dedicated to them before they fade back into the background. The narrator wears out her welcome fast, and doesn’t tell nearly enough funny jokes to justify her presence.And if that’s not bad enough, this show actually seems to be terrified of itself. We never see the Otogi Bank actually pursuing a debt, because it’s terrified of making the characters look unlikeable. The constant fairy tale references never really amount to anything, because it’s terrified of not being taken seriously. We never find out exactly what happened to Ryoko in middle school, because it’s terrified of upsetting the audience. We never see Ryoushi asking her out on an actual date, because it’s terrified of exploring how such an exaggerated character would react to normal social interactions. The narrator won’t shut the hell up, because it’s scared that the writing won’t hold up on it’s own.The writing in general, is really, really bad. It constantly alternates between being insultingly stupid and just plain boring. The amnesia storyline alone is an episode painful enough to skip. The episode where a butler tries to find a bride for his ward is even worse, as he uses it as an excuse to make shallow, despicable remarks about the entire female cast before revealing that he didn’t need to be there in the first place. At no point do the characters ever act like real people.And the ending... You know what? Throw up a spoiler tag, because I really fucking need to address this. At the end of the series, a rival school... The respective hell to their heaven... kidnaps several main characters, and just to make things more personal, Ryoko is kidnapped and held hostage by the very man who allegedly did something violation-y to her. I won’t tell you how this is resolved, but I’ll sure as hell tell you how it isn’t resolved. Despite the clear cases of assault and abduction... and others, I’m sure... Nobody calls the cops. Who definitely exist in this universe. Would it be anticlimactic, like the end of Monty Python and the holy Grail? No, because Ryoko is being held captive by the very man who got away cleanly with something vague to her. Yeah, it doesn’t take Dick Tracey to look at this scenario and start wondering if she’d been telling the truth back then.For the non-spoiler version... The main villain, who is introduced with a promising bang, ultimately fades out with an anticlimactic whimper, promising revenge for a sequel series that will hopefully never come. Hell, that’s pretty much how the series ends as a whole… Nothing is resolved, and early implications about the village being part of a social experiment filled with fairy tale references amounts to absolutely nothing. I know it’s easy to say that someone couldn’t write their way out of a paper bag, but it really does seem like somebody deliberately was trying to do just that... And failing miserably at it.Strictly speaking, Okami-san isn’t the worst anime I’ve ever seen. It’s not even on my bottom ten. But you know what? I still hate it. I don’t even hate the anime I once gave 0/10, but I hate this anime. And trust me, there’s a very, very small list of anime that I flat-out hate. It’s bad enough that it’s stupid, full of shit, and blatantly sexist, but the way it approaches the subject of rape just tips the scales entirely against it.I haven’t seen every anime, so I could be wrong about this, but outside of hentai, rape is a subject that doesn’t exist in the medium. It can be joked about, or threatened, but it doesn’t actually happen, and it doesn’t get dealt with. This is one of the reasons that Now and Then, Here and There is such a rare gem… Any anime that introduces a plot point about one of it’s characters being raped, and actually explores the repercussions and recovery of the attack, can easily be considered a ground breaking series. What frustrates me the most about Okami-san is that by introducing the rape implications in a lazy attempt to explain Ryoko’s character, they actually come really close to pulling this off… Only to pussy out at every turn. They vaguely introduce the subject when needed, then drop it cold and try to make us forget about it until the next time it’s needed. I know it isn’t fair of me to whole-heartedly condemn this series because of what I wanted it to be, rather than what it was, but what it was was no peach, okay?Okami-san and her Seven Companions was dubbed by Funimation, and can be viewed for free on Netflix. You can also find a lot of other anime on Netflix that don’t suck, so don’t even bother with this festering field full of fairy tale feces. It isn’t well written, it isn’t well produced... It just isn’t well. I gave it a four out of ten the first time I watched it, but now that I’ve watched it twice, I think it’s much more appropriate to give this series a 2/10."", 'Okami-sanEmbodying the fairy tales of yore, Okami-San is a fun, hilarious, romantic romp. (Warning, there is a spoiler at the end of the story panel)StoryThe story centers upon a modern day club, The Otogi High School Bank, which does essentially any requested favor which in return earns the club a favor that can be cashed in at any time.

What is the right way to pander? Well, Studio J.C. Staff seems to know of a formula containing of cute girls, school, a school club, a few pretty boys, and a cast of trope characters. Ookami-San and Her Seven Companions is the culmination of how to make an average anime. Is this anime average though? Well, given the tough task of trying to get something special out of this anime was none other than the Love Hina director Yoshiaki Iwasaki.This story is a comedy parody of sort focused...around a tom-boy like character in Ookami Ryouko. It follows her and her friends around their adventures surrounding their sort-of club called the Otogoi Bank. This club is tasked with solving any and all problems ranging from love life to thug life. Of course, most of the members are female and a couple of pretty boys as well. There is even a cheeky narrator breaking the fourth wall occasionally and pointing out certain aspects about the characters such as flaws in their personalities and the boob sizes of the girls.There is of course a self-insert character that confesses his love for Ookami and blindly follows the adventures and becomes the main secondary character within the Otogi Bank. Sad to say, most of the characters and points within this show is pretty shallow. There are a few highlights such as the importance of friendship and believing in yourself, but they do not outshine how bland the show is. This is not a show about any real character development, but more of something filled with an occasional gimmick and something to get a few chuckles out of the viewer every now and again.The characters art, backgrounds, tone of the anime are nothing real special by any means, but there is not anything to complain about either.

It had a wonderful set of characters and a unique plot to boost it\'s appeal, although the plot was kinda rushed. It also showed how a Tsundere is REALLY done. I first watched this anime a year ago (when I started out anime) and rewatched it just today, and so have a review ready.Story: 7/10The story was quite unique in it\'s own sense. First the positives, a lot of plot was covered in just 12 episodes and the benefit was that not a minute was...wasted in filler episodes. Though like most modern high school anime a pool episode was a must, but thankfully Ookamisan snuck up a small plot point there as well. The biggest problem I faced with the anime was that the plot was rushed up in many places. Thankfully I already watched this before so I could understand stuff more once I rewatched it but at first glance the plot went too fast. Too many things were covered at once, now this wasn\'t necessarily a bad thing because no time was wasted but I\'m sure it would have been better if this was stretched out to 24 episodes.Art: 7/10The art was amazing to watch. One thing I love to see in the art of most animes is the eye designs, and Ookami San excelled in that field as well.

Even now I feel it had a better MC than most other romances. First off, Morino was the one to confess first, he was the one who harbored feelings. Pretty rare to see that happen in the dense-MC filled romance anime genre. Plus, even though they made him look like a weakling at times, there was a really good reason for him to be strong. Apart from that, he developed wonderfully along with Ryouko. Coming to Ryouko, she much like JC Staff\'s more popular sibling ToraDora\'s Tsundere Taiga, excellently displayed how to do a Tsundere character. Ryouko unlike most other TsunDeres of the \'10s and newer, rarely ever hit Morino, apart from that she still showed here tsun and dere sides perfectly and balanced it as well. I applaud the author for writing such good characters. Development was a lot between these two, while for the rest of the cast, let\'s say they did their job s supporting characters well. Although I would have loved it if they developed as well (apart from Ringo\'s arc) but they did their job very well as a supporting cast.Enjoyment: 7/10One of the biggest reasons I made this my first ever rewatched anime is because it has a lot of rewatch potential. I loved it when I started out anime and still love it today. It had it\'s share of fun, seriousness and heartwarming romance up it\'s sleeve, which is precisely why I thoroughly enjoyed Ookamisan and her seven companions, TWICE.Overall: 6.6 (Averaged)In the end, Ookami San had it\'s set of positives and negatives. It had a wonderful cast, excellent Seiyuus and also had it\'s share of problems being a rushed-y plot and mediocre sound track, but once you finish the anime you\'ll be satisfied with what you watched. That\'s what makes this anime such a joy to watch. And who knows? Like me, you might come back again to rewatch it later on. wasted in filler episodes. Though like most modern high school anime a pool episode was a must, but thankfully Ookamisan snuck up a small plot point there as well. The biggest problem I faced with the anime was that the plot was rushed up in many places. Thankfully I already watched this before so I could understand stuff more once I rewatched it but at first glance the plot went too fast. Too many things were covered at once, now this wasn\'t necessarily a bad thing because no time was wasted but I\'m sure it would have been better if this was stretched out to 24 episodes.Art: 7/10The art was amazing to watch.

So the first episode turned out very misleading for me - I got hooked by the idea of great action fights with a cute railguny FMC and lowkey awesome MC, interesting and unique weapons, etc. Even the ""side quest"" characters in its second part could dish...out/receive some serious kick, so my hype was still real - a 10/10 start.The fairy tale mix was a nice surprise, but hinted at my mistaken first impression, and I was quickly brought back to reality as I watched further.

Surprisingly, ""Okami-san"" is NOT that series. Its fairy tale motifs are mostly superficial and rarely have anything to do with the characters\' personalities or stories. Strip those away, however, and all you have is an enjoyable but ultimately generic high school action series with very few things that any anime fan is unlikely to have seen before.Story (6/10):Set in the fictional city of Otogibana, ""Okami-san"" revolves...around the members of the Otogi Bank, an organization consisting of students from Otogi High School that is dedicated to helping out people, mostly other students, with whatever problems they may have in exchange for the clients doing a favour for them at a later date. Chief among their members are Ryoko Okami, a gruff girl with a troubled past, and her best friend and roommate Ringo Akai. Just when the group is considering adding a new member, preferably a guy so that the girls aren\'t stuck doing all the work, Ryoko encounters Ryoshi Morino, a timid boy who claims to be in love with her. While the two get off on the wrong foot at first due to a number of misunderstandings, caused both by Ryoshi\'s shyness and self-deprecation and Ryoko\'s abrasive personality, Ryoshi is ultimately accepted into the group as their newest member, after which he assists her, Ringo and the rest of the Otogi Bank with whatever problems and favours come their way.The series follows an episodic format, consisting of mostly self-contained stories where a student or some other resident will come into the Otogi Bank requesting a favour and the members will see it be fulfilled, though there are also a few episodes that shake up the formula a little. Some of these stories are actually quite compelling, most notably the ones that delve into the pasts of the various Otogi Bank members, with Ryoko and Otsu\'s episodes being especially standout examples. Others are less inspired such as the episode where they have to help a young rich boy find a bride and the one with, bar none, the cheapest amnesia plot I have seen in any story, ever. Without giving anything too significant away, the memory loss comes out of absolutely nowhere, has no bearing on the plot of the episode or the series as a whole and is pretty much treated like it never happened by the time the episode ends.But the story\'s biggest problem is the incredibly inconsistent tone. I doubt anyone would have complained if ""Okami-san"" started off as another light-hearted anime that gradually became more serious overtime, but instead the series often switches between the two from episode to episode and doesn\'t seem to be able to settle on either. It just doesn\'t seem to know whether it wants to be an action series or a slice-of-life show, and as a result fails in being a particularly good example of either genre. The story also ultimately ends with none of the overarching plot points resolved, not even the romance between Ryoko and Ryoshi, despite the latter having confessed as early as the first episode, which I know will infuriate a lot of viewers. All in all, not a great plot, even with a few good individual stories.Art & Animation (8/10):Given that the animation studio is J.C. Staff, it\'s probably not surprising that ""Okami-san""\'s visuals are far from what you\'d call eye-massaging, even considering that it first aired more than a decade ago. It\'s certainly better looking than the likes of ""Aria the Scarlet Ammo"" (which came out the year after), but when compared to the ""A Certain Magical/Scientific"" adaptations or the later seasons of ""Shakugan no Shana"", it starts to look pretty average. Overall, while just about everything is well-drawn and fairly detailed, I can\'t really remember any moments or shots that stood out for me.Sound & Dialogue (8/10):""Okami-san""\'s soundtrack is overall pretty forgettable. It\'s barely even there a lot of the time, and when it is there, it just blends into the background, to the point that you probably won\'t even notice it. The only exception I can think of is the opening, and even that is hardly what you would call spectacular. On the other hand, the voice acting is great, with the dub containing a pretty solid cast- Brina Palencia, Joel McDonald and Monica Rial all do great jobs as Ryoko, Ryoshi and Ringo, respectively, and there\'s also a stellar supporting cast that includes Colleen Clinkenbeard, Todd Haberkorn and Caitlin Glass among others. Unfortunately, the frequent snarky narrations provided by Luci Christian (speaking in the same ""elderly woman"" voice she uses in ""Kamisama Kiss"") tend to be more annoying than funny, especially when she starts talking over what the actual characters in the show are saying.Characters (7/10):For the characters, I\'ll start with Ryoko, who\'s loosely based off the Big Bad Wolf from ""Little Red Riding Hood"". This has little to do with her actual character, however, and physically her appearance and voice easily brings Holo from ""Spice and Wolf"" to mind, to the point that she could easily pass as a descendant of hers. If she is, however, she inherited pretty much all of the wrong genes, as not only does she lack the charisma that made Holo so compelling, but she takes the tsundere side of her to the extreme, being very abrasive and often abusive towards Ryoshi. I normally like tsunderes, but Ryoko frequently pushed the limit of what I can tolerate, especially since Ryoshi rarely, if ever, does anything to deserve her wrath. Of course, I\'d be lying if I said she doesn\'t have her reasons, and she does soften up considerably in later episodes, even if she\'s still completely unable to be honest with herself. She\'s also a huge badass, easily one of the biggest in the series, so there\'s that. However, my favourite character would have to be Ryoshi. The very first episode establishes Ryoshi as a huge dork, but in a good way, being very kind but also extremely shy and awkward due to suffering from severe scorophobia (a fear of being stared at), which results in him often blending into the background. Not only does this make him the most endearing of the main characters, but I also found myself relating to him the most, as I\'ve always been pretty socially awkward and often feel alone in a crowd. The irony is that his fairy tale character is the hunter who kills or drives off the big bad wolf, yet Ryoshi\'s stated goal from the beginning is to protect Ryoko, whom he\'s in love with. He does a surprisingly good job at it too, as despite his shyness, he has a fantastic aim with a slingshot, which he uses to back up Ryoko from afar while she gets up close and personal. Sadly, much like Ryoko, his development never really goes all the way, as he remains largely the same even in the final episode, despite having worked really hard to become stronger in the episodes prior.Rounding up the main trio is Ringo, also known as Little Red Riding Hood, which adds even further fairy tale irony due to her being Ryoko\'s best friend. Ringo can be pretty much be described as Ryoko\'s opposite, being the brains to her brawn and the girly girl to her tomboy. While she appears quite friendly on the surface and acts as Ryoko\'s moral compass, she also has a surprisingly manipulative streak, though this is more played for comedy than anything. While part of the main cast, a late episode is pretty much all about her, as she deals with serious guilt brought upon by an old family feud, though anything else is best left unsaid. Besides these three, there is also six other members of the Otogi Bank. One notable example is Otsu Tsurugaya, a young girl who works as the maid for the bank and has an obsession with returning favours to people. While this seems to be just a fun little quirk at first, she turns out to have a very tragic reason behind it in her focus episode. Both Ringo and Otsu\'s episodes are surprisingly touching and deal with some pretty heavy subject matter, especially Otsu\'s, as she grows to realise that her well-meaning nature can end up causing serious problems for those she considers friends. Unlike Ringo, however, Otsu doesn\'t really have any focus before or after her episode, being largely relegated to a background character, which is a real shame.And that is pretty much the main problem with the characters. While the series does do a decent job at giving most characters their time in the sun in certain episodes, with the obvious exceptions of Ryoko, Ryoshi and Ringo, most of them don\'t get any real focus beyond this. It\'s not too big of an issue, since their focus episodes do give them a fair amount of development, but the point still stands that it takes more than just one episode for me to get attached to a character, and there are even a few characters who get no focus at all. Notable examples include Majolica le Fay, a nerdy teenage girl who dresses like a witch for whatever reason and whose only purpose is to make gadgets for the group to use, like Ryoko\'s kitty boxing gloves, and Liszt Kiriki, the president of the Otogi Bank who is nominally the leader yet probably does the least work out of the entire group, with most of the practical work being handled by his cousin Alice, who doesn\'t get any real focus either. This is given a justification by the fairy tale character he\'s based off, but I highly doubt that many people will consider that to be a good enough reason. I know I didn\'t.Enjoyment (7/10):Exactly how enjoyable ""Okami-san"" is really depends on what episode you\'re talking about, with some episodes being very entertaining, exciting or even touching, while others are really boring or just a pain to sit through. There is a good amount of comedy, but a lot of it is pretty mundane and not anything you haven\'t likely seen before. As I mentioned above, the series also gets dark at times, and when it does, it gets REALLY dark, to the point that you will probably feel like you\'re watching a completely different anime, which is not necessarily a good thing depending on how much you can stomach.Overall:""Okami-san and her Seven Companions"" is one of those anime with its good parts and bad parts, having enough to be a good way to spend a few hours but far from enough to be regarded as essential viewing. It has good action scenes, likable characters and respectable visuals and voice acting, but when it comes to being a romantic comedy, it falls a long way short of greatness. It also ultimately isn\'t anything you haven\'t seen before, with its one gimmick adding nothing to the series as a whole.Score:6+8+8+7+7=36/50=7.2/10 around the members of the Otogi Bank, an organization consisting of students from Otogi High School that is dedicated to helping out people, mostly other students, with whatever problems they may have in exchange for the clients doing a favour for them at a later date.

This is given a justification by the fairy tale character he\'s based off, but I highly doubt that many people will consider that to be a good enough reason. I know I didn\'t.Enjoyment (7/10):Exactly how enjoyable ""Okami-san"" is really depends on what episode you\'re talking about, with some episodes being very entertaining, exciting or even touching, while others are really boring or just a pain to sit through. There is a good amount of comedy, but a lot of it is pretty mundane and not anything you haven\'t likely seen before. As I mentioned above, the series also gets dark at times, and when it does, it gets REALLY dark, to the point that you will probably feel like you\'re watching a completely different anime, which is not necessarily a good thing depending on how much you can stomach.Overall:""Okami-san and her Seven Companions"" is one of those anime with its good parts and bad parts, having enough to be a good way to spend a few hours but far from enough to be regarded as essential viewing. It has good action scenes, likable characters and respectable visuals and voice acting, but when it comes to being a romantic comedy, it falls a long way short of greatness. It also ultimately isn\'t anything you haven\'t seen before, with its one gimmick adding nothing to the series as a whole.Score:6+8+8+7+7=36/50=7.2/10', ""This show had great potential but the studio just destroyed any possibility of that. The writers for the show managed to cram eleven books into twelve episodes. The whole show suffered because of this. For whatever reason they seemed to think that the story wouldn't be good enough to have a chance at a second season, and they guaranteed that by using all the material and giving a poor delivery. "", ""There's nothing more misleading than this animes synopsis and profile imageTo summarise,The club is C-rated version of Oregairu's humanitarian club where they helped other people and got back favours (Here favours are mandatory, oregairu had a 'with the flow' kinda thing)The personalities are original as in completely different from oregairu MC's but too much used in the anime worldPlotlines; I haven't read the light novel but In the anime it sure was forced. eg. The arcs are completely 19th century typical shounen manga ones but they had to force some dark themes(nsfw) and it's not that they added it to give a wider view on...things, They just added it and left it to the viewers imagination. things, They just added it and left it to the viewers imagination."", 'This is my first review, and really I have no idea why I chose this anime to be my first one to review but it\'s happening.Well, where do I begin. Ookami-san focuses on a ""bank"" that helps people with their issues. This is a pretty interesting concept that is sure to grab people\'s interests, me included. Ok, I admit. I barely skimmed the synopsis before I started watching the show. Due to this, I somehow thought that ""helping with their issues"" meant this was going to be a quiet, soul searching type of anime. And yes, this was completely my fault. Yes, this show has...it\'s serious points and there are some attempts at being deep throughout the plot. But if you\'re looking for a phycological, deep anime then please don\'t look to Ookami-San to fulfill that. If you\'re looking to turn your brain and watch a rom-com with decent humor that\'s pretty fun to watch, THEN look to Ookami-San.Story: There really isn\'t much of a plot in this anime. It\'s in that weird in-between area that can\'t be classed as episodic but doesn\'t have much of a continuous plot either. I feel like if you sat someone down who\'s never seen the show before and had them watch a random episode in the middle of the series they\'d probably be ok. In a way, this reminds me of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It centers around a bunch of weird kids running around doing weird things in a weird club. There are background stories for some of the supporting characters and that add a touch of seriousness, but a lot of times it\'s random, forced and feels weird. Ookami\'s relationship with Shiro is explained as well as the trauma behind it- but the thing is, it never feels finished. Close to the end, it\'s kind of just dropped and it\'s pretty frustrating. It just doesn\'t feel finished or satisfying. The love stories in the show are really nothing to write home about, with one frustratingly slow (It\'s not like I care what you\'re doing b-b-baka!) and one between a borderline stalker and a lady\'s man that\'s just plain bizarre. Don\'t expect the ending to wrap anything up either- this is one of those shows that just kind of ends with no real conclusion.Art: The art is ok. It\'s nothing special but it\'s not bad either. Some of the character designs could get on your nerves, like the eleven year old kid the resembles a mouse that comes in for one episode. That one made my eyes hurt.Sound: I have to admit, the opening and ending songs for the show were both extremely catchy and could become addictive. I loved them both.Characters: Oh boy, here\'s where the fun begins. This anime has nearly any archetype you could think of. We\'ve got your Tsundere as the main character- and boy does she stay true to that title. I know a lot of you are die-hard Tsundere funs, but personally I found nothing endearing about a ""tough but actually not"" girl that beat the crap out of poor Ryoushi. The other characters included a maid girl, a snarkly loli, a super eccentric wizard girl, a business-type with little to no emotion, a stalker/obsessive girl, a lady\'s man, a level-headed guy with a permanent good mood that has his kinks (in this case that includes cross-dressing and disguises) and of course your clumsy, weak love interest that has his manly moments in the name of love. As I stated before, there was some minor development for some characters but there was a lot of wasted potential due to the giant cast and small number of episodes. Another thing people seem to complain about is the narrator. It\'s true that the ""captain obvious"" moments can leave you rolling your eyes. It\'s a little much for a serious where there isn\'t so much going on that things need to be explained constantly. She can be funny though- take her for what she is. Overall, while the characters were likable and very hard to hate, they weren\'t exactly memorable. Be prepared to see characters that come in for one episode and then are never mentioned again. That includes our lovely poor girl that comes in in the last episode and is for some reason a major plot device- what the heck was that?Enjoyment: This is a fun show to watch as long as you don\'t take it to seriously. As long as you take it for what it is, you should enjoy the series. I\'m not saying you should put it on the top of your priority list- but maybe consider it for a rainy day with nothing to do.Overall- 7/10. it\'s serious points and there are some attempts at being deep throughout the plot.

The male MC\'s quirk is that he\'s scared of being stared at, which really just becomes an annoying and overused bit over the course of the show. The female MC is like taiga(toradora) + maid-sama but infinitely more irritating than both. I wouldn\'t recommend it unless ur looking for something mindless to fall asleep to. ', '[spoilers are not in this half of the review]This is actually one of my favorites. Some episodes were so good, some were a bit boring but the Animation and color choice in this anime are always top notch, the backgrounds were great too. The music was pretty good in some parts, but overall not that attention-grabbing. This show is really nostalgic for me because I watched it in middle school.The character designs are fun, but I always felt like Ookami was a parody of Taiga from Toradora and Ryoshi was like the average Hero anime MC, just given really bad social anxiety.The music...was good during some parts but it didn\'t catch my attention.This show feels original *enough* but if youre expecting something genre-bending,this isn\'t it. However, the characters are still funny, entertaining and endearing. I really liked the atmosphere of this anime.The issues I had with it were the meandering plot and how quickly within episodes it went from ""Omg, this scene is so good"" to ""okay, skip, skip, get on with it, I\'ve seen this spiel before... Get back to the good stuff."" It\'s like the author/writers didn\'t know how to write the moments in between Action, Slice-of-life, and Comedy. The moments where characters were explaining things or being genuine to each other were often really boring, and they might not have been bad if the rest of the show was at that same pace, but because the show goes fom calm to exciting so quickly, the calm parts get really boring. Also the ending (and overall direction the plot took towards the end) felt like a letdown. Like, ""Huh? That\'s how this anime is ending?? Why??""[SPOILERS ARE BELOW]THE BIGGEST ISSUE I had with this anime is the way it deals with the sexual assualt against ookami-san, making it a whole ""I have to be the hero now"" thing for Ryoshi. As someone who\'s been though sexual assualt, this show dealt with it so badly.Ryoshi has to prove himself more of a man than her abuser... for some reason. In the middle/end of the anime he seems to think he can fix her and make her tough side just go away because its not the real her or something. YIKES.He is pulled out of his shyness and fear by his want to protect Ookami *even if she doesn\'t want him to protect her*. Which I get, she is stubborn and won\'t admit when she needs help, but I don\'t think they ever had a proper talk about how she feels about what happened or Ryoshi asking how he can actually help her.I know, that\'s because having tension/a misunderstanding between them creates more drama, and animes need to create drama, but this was such a poor subject to do that with. It\'s like they invalidated the feelings of someone who was sexually assualted, chocking up her not wanting help or not wanting to talk about what happened to just being a ""stubborn tsundere girl"". People often don\'t want to talk about their abuse or cope by being tough. So Ookami isn\'t just being foolish acting that way, putting up a front because she\'s pretty insecure. It\'s a lasting change in how she acts towards people and feels about herself, that was instead treat like, ""Ookami is a stubborn tsundere, how cute! She\'s fiesty"" with inadequate acknowledgement for how thats literally aproduct of self esteem issues and trauma. Its not just cute. It won\'t just go away because some guy fights for you either.It was used to expain why Ookami is so tough and such a tsundere, but was unrealistic because how she reacts to threats near the end is so inconsistent with the first half of the anime.For example: She collapses when her abuser tries to talk her up. Literally collapses on the concrete. Even with PTSD, that\'s pretty rare, especially from someone with the hard resolve of Ookami. It felt really out of character and like it was just unrealistic drama for drama\'s sake, like how anime girls break down crying out of nowhere. Her SA trauma and the battles with her abuser was such a big plot point of the show yet it was so badly executed.Also, I was really happy how its implied Ookami and Ryoshi start dating, but it gives it the feeling of one of those ""love fixed me"" endings... was good during some parts but it didn\'t catch my attention.This show feels original *enough* but if youre expecting something genre-bending,this isn\'t it.

Seikai no Senki Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/399/Seikai_no_Senki_Special,"[""Another special for this franchize recapping Seikai no Senki.Compared to the previous recap that didn't work as a stand alone, this one is longer by 30 minutes which may sound weird because SnS was basically 13 episodes of space battles, the producers could have easily made a one hour special revisiting the important moments in preparation for SnS II. But doing it this way we actually got an interesting movie, scenes tie up together, the pacing is very good and it feels that you're following the story develop from point A to point B naturally and not forced.I didn't analyze it so much as to...point out the extra scenes, I missed them but not noticing them means that they weren't that impactful or they were used in minor areas to make it look better as a one episode special, the story developments are the same as the TV series, it's useless to wrap your head around that.In the end, it was a very good recap which I can recommend it as an alternative for the main show. I even recommend it to total newbies because we get all the background info in the first minutes, Seikai no Monshou was a prologue story anyways, the real deal starts with SnS when our main duo is in the Space Force and fights in the war. point out the extra scenes, I missed them but not noticing them means that they weren't that impactful or they were used in minor areas to make it look better as a one episode special, the story developments are the same as the TV series, it's useless to wrap your head around that.In the end, it was a very good recap which I can recommend it as an alternative for the main show.

It's still just chibi shorts but they're way less chliché and actually add a bit to the main anime now.The events in the shorts are about a detail or theme from the episode of the main anime with the same number. This means that the best time to watch a short is after finishing an episode but you can also just watch them later if you forget. The humor is all in all quite enjoyable.The characters are the seven shadows and all of them get some attention. The animation is about...as good as you're going to get for chibi characters and the voice acting/music is fine too.Overall these shorts are a pretty nice addition and fun to watch if you're a fan of the anime/characters but probably not worth your time if you dislike the main anime or dislike chibi animation. as good as you're going to get for chibi characters and the voice acting/music is fine too.Overall these shorts are a pretty nice addition and fun to watch if you're a fan of the anime/characters but probably not worth your time if you dislike the main anime or dislike chibi animation.""]"

And to be honest, it can go 1001 ways and feel tiresome, but it\'s interesting to see these issues being tackled with the weirdness of inferring through food. It\'s quite the entrancing charm though, mixing the fun and easy environment in what is supposed to be a dark and heavy setting, and both MCs Ramune and Kuro conspicuously consuming the ""food-of-the-week"" relating to the episodic nature of the story.In shows like these where you\'ll encounter the ""Master and Apprentice"" setting, it\'s often a gimmick that one will play off as the funny guy and the other a serious one, and it\'s no different here. Dr. Ramune, more than just a weirdo on the outside, he\'s more of the witty person who tries to play it off as the funny guy most of the time, but when the situation calls for it, he\'s down to the task and to the T, administering the right medicine for the various occurrences of patients\' body parts being replaced or prescribed by food. His assistant, Kuro (or Shorty / Chibi), is more of the serious boy, whom like other patients suffering under mysterious illnesses, got the attention of the doctor when he ran away from home from disbelief, and subsequently the know-how of Ramune managed to cure him, and he\'s been stuck with him ever since.

Other than that, she\'s the maker of the ""mysterious items"" that Ramune constantly uses to deal with patients that have these ""mysterious illnesses"", alongside Nico whom is blind and has to rely on his other superhuman senses with exceptional accuracy. In the case of Momiji, the master whom the apprentice is afraid of, Ramune\'s just being exploited by Momiji\'s terrifying looks that are reminiscent of a mix of Muzan with Luffy\'s Gomu Gomu powers (plus the voice of Sukuna), so much so that he develops a fear of trauma, but in actual fact, all that Ramune needs to do is to trust in him. Another case of weirdo nutcases, but it helps giving the small character cast a bit of diversity.As usual, Platinum Vision\'s visuals may be hit-or-miss, but after watching recent shows made by the studio in the veins of Kono Oto Tomare! (of what I consider to be the studio\'s Magnum Opus), this is back to those levels of drawing a fine line between decent and good art and animation, so really, nothing much to complain about.Being a King Records production in the music space for Sunday night shows (in Japan), I already knew what kind of music I was going to expect and experience: some great poppin\' beats music, and it\'s what I got from Yuuma Uchida\'s peppy and very catchy OP that\'s worth the listen with some dancing, definitely not disappointed at all. saji\'s ED is also a very fitting song for closures, as is with the whole feeling of the anime with its mix of supernatural and psychological conundrums. One Easter Egg worth noting is that Momiji is voiced by Junichi Suwabe, the same VA who did Jujutsu Kaisen\'s Sukuna, as is the MC Ramune by Yuuma Uchida himself.This show is definitely a weird one to say, and it won\'t please anyone looking for a rich story with deep characters.

One Easter Egg worth noting is that Momiji is voiced by Junichi Suwabe, the same VA who did Jujutsu Kaisen\'s Sukuna, as is the MC Ramune by Yuuma Uchida himself.This show is definitely a weird one to say, and it won\'t please anyone looking for a rich story with deep characters. With that said, if you\'re content with watching ordinary people deal with ordinary problems, then this is the show for you. It isn\'t so much a dull prose, though it certainly gives of the feeling of being one.', ""It's a cool anime to watch if you're bored and want to see some creepy stories. But the characters and the plot is weak. And confuse, sometimes. Reminds me XXX Holic, but not so scared and mysterious, more simple. You don't really understand the characters, because you don't know them. You just see how they act in some situation, but their personality isn't explored. Kuro is just an antisocial boy, quiet the most part of the time, while Ramune... try to be the funny guy, but at the same time the creepy one.

It certainly isn\'t on par to a lot of big anime, old or new, that may be airing, but I definitely found myself enjoying every episode that had aired.Following the translation of the name, ""Dr. Ramune: Mysterious Disease Specialist,"" it certainly lives up to it. The diseases for each character were unique, and although they were mysterious, they were superbly weird. The ways to cure the patients were also interesting...to watch, and I liked that the items were temporary fixes, whereas the disease itself had to be cured by facing the way it initially occurred. There wasn\'t really any specific direction for the story, but for this anime, there isn\'t much need. There are still little touches and connections between episodes, especially in the final episode.Usually something so strange may end up being something you can\'t take seriously, but I felt there was a good balance between both in this anime.

It is a causality rule which humans often forget exist.to be honest, it really isn't something to be proud of, good enough art, good enough sound,...but sadly the characters are not what most people would find relatable, where ironically that's what Kuro was meant to be, the viewer's representation inside the Anime.Yes, it doesn't really consider many things that would be factoring how the Anime would be perceived but in the least, it is a good watch while having an Internal Reflection on how we've been living off of our environment. but sadly the characters are not what most people would find relatable, where ironically that's what Kuro was meant to be, the viewer's representation inside the Anime.Yes, it doesn't really consider many things that would be factoring how the Anime would be perceived but in the least, it is a good watch while having an Internal Reflection on how we've been living off of our environment."", ""The story was pretty unique but if 10th and 11th episodes could have been aired as 2nd and 3rd episode  and some changes in accordance to that have been mad the rating of this show could have improved.There are still some unanswered questions like why the nail clipper didn't respond to Ramune and the way sounds and design was showed it piqued my curiosity which remained unanswered till the end of the show.The apprentice and master relationship was really hilarious and I really enjoyed it.The 112year old grandma concept was also great and the look of perversion on her face were really hilarious and...enjoyable.The ending was quite good and it justifies the way anime ends and I can really call that the anime ended in good sense.More episodes will be surely welcomed but personally i don't  they would have much to offer. enjoyable.The ending was quite good and it justifies the way anime ends and I can really call that the anime ended in good sense.More episodes will be surely welcomed but personally i don't  they would have much to offer."", ""This anime is soooo good!!

But, don\'t judge a book by its cover. It actually surpassed my expectations. The show keeps me engaged with new ""diseases"". Every episode left me curious of who and what someone would show up with. Believe me there were some parts that were really really weird. For the most part as long as the show is not overbearing with weirdness, I overlook it for the most part.The character is well. Stupid. However, he knows what he is doing and gets the job done. The most enjoyable...part of the show us how each of the ""diseases"" can actually be visual representation of what each character is suffering from. The artwork is good in that way but otherwise it is slightly above average in that regard.The story follows the same pattern for the most part so far, so it may get boring for some. It gets points off for that.Overall, this anime is alright. It does have potential. If I do watch it to the end, I will reevaluate my ratings.

Despite that, it manages to be coherent and  have a beginning, middle& end which is always appreciated.Based on the story, there is a paranormal energy that exists in the world. If someone is under very stressful circumstances, it\'ll get the chance to inhibit them and cause paranormal -and rather absurd- ""illnesses"". With that ruse, we see some cases of these absurd illnesses. What caught me...by surprise was the very solid reasoning behind every almost comical effect of them.The main characters are fleshed out beautifully through the short run of the show, navigating us through unexpectedly heavy subjects, as you\'ll realize in the very first episode. Every character has to face and overcome the cause of their stress or trauma in order for them to be cured, with the help and guidance of that seemingly empty headed ""doctor"", who often understands them more than they understand themselves. A ""doctor"" who is ready to do a lot more than he should perhaps to help the ones in need.Next to that, you also have the beauty of the supernatural items and the shop that sells them, further introducing us to the ""lore"" of the world, making it more interesting and fairy tale- esque. These episodes are also more toned down& that compliments the ""case"" ones which have a more serious tone.Regarding those items, I really enjoyed how they were described as using you instead of you using them. There is a price for everything, but its definitely not monetary. How much are you willing to give to save someone you love? Will you pay a high price to hide from the issue, knowing it’ll turn around & bite you later? I really liked these small questions they create, along with the fact that knowledge& wisdom can allow you to go further without suffering the loss that a desperate person using them would pay. Everything has its cost, but knowledge can help you get the right coins.Overall, its not too heavy, extravagant or funny, but it definitely manages to make you care about the characters and the cases they get involved in and enjoy the outcome!

There\'s a clear understanding by the doctor as to why they are afflicted with the disease. Basically, the afflicted person always has this one large mental problem with their personal lives that they have to solve and Ramune essentially gives them the push and resolve...to do so. The problem I have with this format is that the ""problem"" is so obvious and there isn\'t much of any analysis into a person\'s psyche. It\'s just, someone\'s doing something wrong, and their mysterious disease gives them a hint as to what they\'re doing wrong, and they have to resolve this issue before it gets out of hand.I wish that each case was more complicated, and instead of one case per episode, to build up a case, why not have 2-3 episodes dedicated to one disease so that we can actually have a more in depth analysis on any given person? Instead, we\'re given just enough information about any given patient and have them go through the cycle of gathering the resolve to fix their own situation, which of course, is also quite formulaic.It\'s not a particularly ""dark"" show as far as I\'m aware, as there\'s only good resolutions for the most part. It would be much more satisfying and give a more layer of mysteriousness so that the conclusion isn\'t always a peaceful resolution. I can\'t for the life of me remember the name the manga this was, but I read a very similar episodic manga, where people were given supernatural items with drawbacks, just like in this show. However, in that manga, the ending wasn\'t always good for the people receiving the item. Rather, it was dependent on their moral scale and decisions as to degree of the end result. If they chose bad decisions, they could die. Other times, they chose correctly, and nothing happened to them.I\'m not saying that this show has to adopt my suggestion, but there definitely has to be something that gives it the ""oomph"" that it unfortunately lacks for me to consider watching this particular episodic anime. to do so.

I was skeptical of this anime but after watching up to ep. 11 I remembered how much I love anime.From the reviews, I know people might\'ve had problems with episode 2, but I\'ll remind everyone that this isn\'t a romance anime. I would like to go into more detail about episode 2 but I think people should decide for themselves on how they view it. But it definitely shouldn\'t stop people from continuing the season.Obviously, the story isn\'t perfect...and it might not be for everyone since the concept of the anime is quite out there. But each episode conveys real problems that people go through almost everyday and a unique way of how to deal with these said problems.This is an anime that tries to say ""Your stress and problems aren\'t meant to be pushed away and buried within you but for you to grow from them."" Viewers get to see Dr. Ramune help people face the truths of what is bothering his patients that medical doctors can\'t really fix.

I really needed some laughs. Since the first episode, I've been totally hooked. It is funny, psychological, mysterious, and heartwarming (sometimes)!The characters are funny and the problems they deal with are real life problems a lot of people have. It reminds me a lot of Bunny girl senpai, because they turn real problems into a supernatural situation, and it allows people to connect to the people in the storyOverall, I think it has a very entertaining art style and storyline, as well as interesting personalities the characters possess. I'm excited to see where this leads and how the story...progresses! progresses!"", 'I understand the other reviews when they say that the show is a bit immature and cliché but it\'s only in the beginning. I think it\'s still pretty good but it gets better later on; the topic gets darker and even though the show overall is more of a comedy genre, the meaning behind the myterious objects and the causes of the sicknesses are actually deeper and it talks about real life problems.So I would recommend watching until the episode 5 (at the moment there are only 6 episodes) because  it really gets you hooked on at this point.At the beginning I was...only watching because the art is pretty good and the story was really unexpected ( kind of weird but in a funny way) but I\'m really enjoying the story so far.The characters are not out of the ordinary but for some reason they are quite likeable. Maybe it\'s because the two are polar opposite but have a good chemistry. Also the comedy scenes are simple, they don\'t try too hard to make it funny because the main character is just dumb so it goes well with the story.The doctor Ramune is not a genius, but he is very competent and does his best to solve the issues altough his methods are a bit questionnable sometimes lol but everything ends well.His assistant Kuro is very smart but he is still learning about the mysteries unlike in other shows where some characters understand everything and are able to find a solution without having any experience.The relationship between the two is funny; Kuro is mature for his age and takes care of Ramune who is a bit of an unreasonable guy. There are some times where he acts a bit like a kid which I think is cute. It might be a bit cliché but it makes us focus more on the storyline which I think is good and I have a feeling we will get to learn more about them in the upcoming episodes.As another reviewer said, I also think that the mysterious objects represent an ""easy way out"" of the problems that actually don\'t solve the real issues. To solve an issue you need to find out how it started, how other people must have felt, ask yourself if what you did was the reason behind it and confont the root of it all. It\'s not about finding something that would make it easier for you because most of the time the problem concerns yourself and another person.The anime sends a strong message in a light way that makes it easy to understand for kids, teenagers or even adults.I think we often forget that the way we act can have consequences and that we should think before acting. It can hurt yourself and others.In conclusion, it\'s a short funny yet deep anime that makes you look at life in a different point of view.

The episodic nature of the series, with each episode focusing on a different case, allows for a variety of creative and unique scenarios.The anime has been both praised and criticized. Some viewers appreciated the imaginative and unconventional approach to medical cases, as well as the exploration of emotional aspects tied to these supernatural illnesses. On the other hand, some criticism was directed towards inconsistent storytelling, varying quality in cases, and subjective preferences for character designs and animation.Ultimately, whether...someone enjoys ""Kai Byoui Ramune"" would depend on their individual tastes and preferences in anime.

Episode 2 is an exception to this rule, but said patient really isn\'t all that sympathetic anyways and it really is just completely off the wall not resembling anything in reality. A lot of the humour comes from Dr. Ramune\'s strange behaviours and how he interacts with Kuro.

I liked the unique concept. I've been so sick of all the generic isekai, romcom, and sports anime recently, this seems like a nice change in pace. I like the idea of the mysterious diseases, although them all being food-related made me somewhat uncomfortable. It's never really explained as to why they are all food-related. It was not really what I was expecting when I started the show. It follows a sort of monster-of-the-week formula with diseases instead. There isn't really an overarching plot. For the most part, you just take things as they...come. It feels refreshing to not have to really think super hard about how everything fits into the story. It becomes slightly more complex when Ramune's master is introduced, but that is near the end. Based on the OP, I thought that his master was going to be the antagonist but there really isn't an actual antagonist besides the diseases themselves.The art direction was not great. It felt like it was going for more stylized but it didn't quite reach the threshold to be called unique. Ramune's design in particular was strange. He was too lanky and didn't quite feel like he had correct proportions. The other designers weren't very memorable, but passable. The animation was pretty poor, but I imagine their budget wasn't too large. It's not necessarily an anime that I felt needed amazing animation. It was more about the stories than any action. But I do hope that they get a larger budget for a second season if they get one. The OP and ED were just bad. The OP often used clips from the episode which I hate. It feels really lazy and spoiler-y. the songs themselves were extremely standard and I usually skipped them.The characters were pretty inoffensive. I didn't actively hate any of them, but there were only a couple that I actually liked. Aona was the best character by far. I liked his story the most too. I liked that he was passionate about what he loved and he was clearly on the spectrum. I loved his little world and his relationship with Kuro. It felt pretty realistic too, a parent forcing their kids to do what they love instead of what the kid loves. The show felt like it was trying to tell me to forgive the dad but what he did seemed pretty unforgivable to me. Unfortunately, one of the worse characters was Dr. Ramune himself. He didn't feel very fleshed out to me, and most of the time he was actively annoying. There wasn't much nuance to his character. We don't get much of his backstory, so it is hard to relate to his motivations.overall, I think it can be worth watching. It's pretty unique, and it has some good parts.

I liked that he was passionate about what he loved and he was clearly on the spectrum. I loved his little world and his relationship with Kuro. It felt pretty realistic too, a parent forcing their kids to do what they love instead of what the kid loves. The show felt like it was trying to tell me to forgive the dad but what he did seemed pretty unforgivable to me. Unfortunately, one of the worse characters was Dr. Ramune himself. He didn't feel very fleshed out to me, and most of the time he was actively annoying. There wasn't much nuance to his character. We don't get much of his backstory, so it is hard to relate to his motivations.overall, I think it can be worth watching. It's pretty unique, and it has some good parts. There are definitely better things out there to watch, but if the premise intrigues you, you may get something out of it."", 'This is a very good anime that focuses on dealing with a lot of issues. everything has a deeper meaning to it for example those mysterious tools are probably referring to solutions that work in the short term but not in the long run and instead of looking for quick fixes we must try and solve the problem from its root.

The plot was predictable from the plot synopsis but still entertained me and got me addicted to watching it fast. The mysterious disease felt like an offshoot from the puberty syndrome from bunny girl senpai but it was unique in its own way from the spiritual Japaneses culture it deprives from. The characters all have their circumstances and are likable. They all have their issues which causes them to have the mysterious disease and are resolved. They relate to real life matters. I especially like our MC Ramune, he was funny and I liked his...personality. The only problem I had with this anime is that it felt like a lot of other anime that had the same old repetition of introducing a new character and new problem. I don dislike but wanted something that got me surprised or had a problem that was the main focus of the season. Overall 7/10 personality.

Karakuri Circus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37447/Karakuri_Circus,"[""This is one of the worst adaptation to ever come out in recent memory. Not only it's a bad anime, but it's also an insult to the original manga by Fujita-sensei which is considered a classic in Japan.Let's go over the biggest problem: it's rushed like hell.How rushed? Well...Imagine if you had to adapt JoJo part 5 into 13 episodes...Or HxH  into 24 episodes...Or FMA into 16 episodes...Or... Well, you get the idea.The original manga is 43 volume long. This anime is 36 episode.This means that even if they adapted a volume per episode, it wouldn't do...it. So they had two choices: either cut whole volumes or cut small content. They choose both.Now to the problems that this causes: it's a mess.There is barely any characterization for the characters we are supposed to care about, and the character development is so sudden it makes no sense. Characters will do things that they would normally never do for no reason at all because of it.The story also just keeps jumping nonstop from one point to another, dramatic moments will happen with no build-up whatsoever and sad songs will play at a sad moment that no one cares about.Technically speaking, it's also ugly. Character movements are too stiff, actions scenes barely have any action and are just static shots of a character delivering an attack. Excessive post-effects are added to some scenes and they also look ugly (for example, the white bloom that is present through the whole hospital arc fight).It also manages to have a terrible directing and editing. Characters will just stand somewhere or walk while talking with nothing happening on-screen (as in episode 4 when two character are talking on the side walk), some cuts are TOO SUDDEN (episode 13 cuts to the opening all of sudden almost as if it wanted to make a cliffhanger, but it just made it worse)  and the narrative in general is really just too much simplified.As I re-write this review, all  of my points are still valid and the show has only gotten WORST. It's downright offensive to the viewers and to the original material.There's not much too say. It's just a really bad and insulting show. A real waste of good source material.TL;DR do yourself a favor and read the great manga it. So they had two choices: either cut whole volumes or cut small content.

It sounds interesting conceptually and Karakuri Circus is more grounded than your typical battle shounen, however it still falls into the same pitfalls that plagues most shounen.Story: (4/10)The story is about a boy named Masaru who has inherited his late father’s fortune. However, a group of people wielding these mysterious puppets are after him trying to get their hands on it. Through a sequence of events he meets Narumi and his puppeteer guardian named Shirogane. Together they...try to rescue and protect Masaru.Based off the premise and watching the first few episodes I was skeptical about  this anime because I knew Masaru was going to be used as a plot device and play the weak, useless, ‘damsel in distress’ role. I’m pleased to say that doesn’t seem to be the case.Characters: (6/10):Masaru is your typical weak crybaby who’s no different to Deku from MHA.Narumi is a muscular man who’s a Kung fu expert and has zonapha syndrome: a illness where he needs to make people laugh or he’ll die. He fills the ‘stronger, more confident’ aniki (older brother) role. Personally, I find him to be the most interesting and fun to watch.Shirogane is beautiful, strong and loyal to Masaru. She’s the most developed and complex character in the show so far. I’m interested in her character arc- developing from a woman who’s been shaped by her tragic upbringing into believing she’s nothing more than a puppet.Animation (6/10):The art is pretty mediocre and nothing really standout about it.The fights are subpar. Narumi’s supposed to have learnt Kung fu, but you couldn’t tell that with the  choreography since he just looks like a big muscular dude beating people up. The fights between puppeteers is weak. Instead of taking the opportunity for creative fights involving strategy, we get some boring fight scenes where they call out special moves. It doesn’t help that Jojo part 5 is running at the same time because it’s like watching a less interesting version of stands being used.Sound (6/10):The opening & ending song are catchy and the visuals are good since it doesn’t spoil much of the series. However, I can’t remember any of the osts. That should tell you how uninspired and forgettable they were.Overall (4/10):I originally was going to rate Karakuri Circus higher because the story started off well, but it goes downhill quickly after the first tragic event. There’s a lot of bad writing and inconsistent moments in the show, that my suspension of disbelief was broken:Masaru’s development from a crybaby to a boy who doesn’t cry anymore and has the eyes of a beast would have been good if it didn’t happen in the span of three episodes... I’m not saying take as long as Deku, but his development is too unrealistic given the timespan.Narumi’s so strong that he’s able to break cage bars... well why didn’t he do that in the first place? If he’s so strong why couldn’t he break the strings?How did Masaru survive jumping out of a building and landing on tree branches with no broken bones? How is this same Masaru who’s covered in blood now able to fight while Shirogane’s injured in her legs? Neither should be able to move.How is Masaru able to wield puppets when it’s supposed to take years of experience to master?How did Masaru survive the burning building? He should have died from lack of oxygen due to inhaling too much smoke or from the building collapsing on them. In fact how wasn’t Narumi’s arm not burnt to ash?If Shirogane had Aqua Vitae all along, then why didn’t she share her blood with Masaru when he was injured throughout the rescue arc?Why does Narumi have a white strand of hair?Beast Tamer girl controls the strongest beasts that the enemy tamer hasn’t been able to all his life, by just staring at them and saying one word? What ability does she have because it’s clearly not the sharingan. No explanation is given.I was never emotionally invested in Beast Tamer girl and her rushed storyline, because of how little screentime she got to begin with.It’s clear to me that the anime is skipping a lot of content from the source material. As a result the pacing is a mess, events aren’t flowing well, there’s a lot of unexplained plot points and underdeveloped characters e.g. Ming-xia, the villains. Characters are being introduced one episode (the faceless & the Shirogane Os), only for them to die the next episode without being properly fleshed out.The long backstory relating to Francine/Eleonore/Sadoyoshi/Masaru’s ancestors etc. was too convoluted and bad writing to explain character’s motivations. Faceless being the mastermind behind everything with his plan to download his memories into Masaru is the worst case of Aizen’s “all according keikaku”. It wasn’t hinted that Faceless even wanted to take over the world and his obsession with Eleanore is creepy. He continues to top himself coming up with more nonsensical plans like sending himself and Shirogane into space to be together, to the point it becomes comical.

Kazuhiro Fujita is the manga artist responsible for works such as Ushio and Tora and Moonlight Act. It’s not his first rodeo of having an anime adaptation. Ushio and Tora got the treatment of a 3-cour show (with a split break) based on his manga. Both series ran a large chunk of chapters before their conclusion. Karakuri Circus takes place in modern Japan focusing on a young boy named Masaru Saiga.The story itself contains elements of action and dark fantasy while the plot revolves with three protagonists....Masaru, Narumi, and Shirogane may all have different personalities but their roles are all pivotal for the integrity of the plot. Masaru’s inheritance from his family paints a target on his back as people are after his money. Narumi and Shirogane saves Masaru from death but also begins a complicated story as their lives changes forever. Make no mistake, Karakuri Circus is actually more complex as it seems on the surface. My original impression of Karakuri Circus felt like the anime managed to do what it could do to get the story flowing. However, several episodes in the early stages begin showing red flags.To put it bluntly, this anime adaptation went way over the speed limit in the beginning. It’s incredibly rushed and skipping many chapters to get to certain plot elements. Just for statistical references, the first four or so episodes adapted at least 25+ chapters. With 43 volumes, this didn’t come to me as a complete surprise. The staff probably wanted to cover the entire manga but by doing so, it also damages the original product as a whole. This glaring red flag told me that Karakuri Circus is a victim of modern day adaptations. What got me curious is why the show didn’t receive more episodes in the first place. Perhaps a split double cour could even remedy this a little but instead, we get a continuous triple cour of 36 episodes. If you think about it, that’s almost 11 chapters per episode if we go with the flow. Luckily, the anime doesn’t exactly go with such numbers but it still suffers from omission. As a fan of the manga, I’m rather dumbfounded.Onto the actual plot, Karakuri Circus seems to have a vision to dive deep into its background story. Events in the past heavily influences the present timeline with characters such as Shirogane based on past incarnations. What began 200 years ago has made powerful impact in the present story. However, the first few episodes didn’t follow such format. Instead, it focused more on our three protagonists attempting to live a normal life. Despite that, fate has linked them together with the past that’s practically inescapable. As more episodes progressed, there’s a so much revealed that it’s hard to take in all at once. This the second red flag of the anime. How can viewers be invested in so much content going on at once? Now, I do get that Karakuri Circus relies on character decisions. Some of these are so important that they change the outcome of the story. But really, it feels that the story goes into many directions rather than being focused in one direction. Unfortunately, that’s not all the problems it suffers.When it comes to characters, the cast itself begins to show weakness. Now on the surface, I do like our main characters. Masaru, Narumi, and Shirogane shares a unique bond together that’s hard to overlook in the beginning. There’s hints of deeper feelings between Narumi and Shirogane while Masaru and Shirogane also develops a close bond. The main problem though lies with its commitment to the characters. We are shown many flashbacks throughout the show that sometimes makes me forget our main characters. The first few episodes made me invest a lot into them but by the time half this show aired, that interest has greatly degenerated. That is, I don’t want to say the characters in the past are not important. On the contrary, they play huge roles such as the case with Francine, the Bai brothers, and members of the Saiga family. Two characters of the past also greatly resemble our main characters – Francine/Shirogane and Narumi/Bai Yin. There’s also emotional value poured into the relationships between certain characters. But as the more I watched the show, the more I felt detached with them. I wanted the anime to just be more focused in one direction and not jump back and forth between every episode. That seems a bit too much to ask because the anime adaptation had other ideas.But still, I do applaud Karakuri Circus for its expansive characters when it comes to diversity. While the anime adaptation suffers from rushed content, certain characters do make an impression. The Saiga family such as Shogi and Angelina are names that shouldn’t be forgotten easily during their arc. Members of the Midnight Circus has unique members with a variety of personalities. Furthermore, some of the antagonists in the show have impactful influences such as the Faceless Commander in later episodes. Hell, the Bai brother are responsible for causing a major story plot in the show – the Zonapha Syndrome. Known for its deadly stages, this syndrome is one of the most important elements in the entire series. So despite the story being rushed, it’s hard to deny that certain characters had great influence in the overall tone of the plot. If only the anime adaptation devoted more time on the plot to be more fluid and tolerable. Too bad.Founded in the August of 2014, studio VOLN had previously worked on Ushio and Tora. For its visual context, Karakuri Circus blends between old school art and new school. What I mean is that the show retains a style of the manga while also able to adapting it to modern standards. Character designs are crafted with precision and uniqueness. Every character seems to stand out on their own without feeling out of place. The most unique designs are the automatas, clowns, and circus acrobats. Many of the modern circus characters have a flamboyant look while the automata gives the impression of unique old school machines. Furthermore, I think praise should be given to the character expressions for being able to sell emotional content when it’s given the chance. The main characters such as Masaru and Narumi are prominent examples of this especially in early episodes. Later on, Shirogane’s emotions becomes much more apparent too. The bottom line is, VOLN managed to make a show that managed to live up to its visual expectations.Karakuri Circus is honestly a mixed bag of sometimes being great at what it does and other times falling short. Anyone who have read the manga will recognize how much the adaptation decided to skip content to get the main story going. That itself is a mistake and is hard to fix. If you came in as an anime original viewer, this might not be such a sour experience. As for me, this was more or less an average anime that could have been much, much more. Masaru, Narumi, and Shirogane may all have different personalities but their roles are all pivotal for the integrity of the plot. Masaru’s inheritance from his family paints a target on his back as people are after his money. Narumi and Shirogane saves Masaru from death but also begins a complicated story as their lives changes forever. Make no mistake, Karakuri Circus is actually more complex as it seems on the surface. My original impression of Karakuri Circus felt like the anime managed to do what it could do to get the story flowing. However, several episodes in the early stages begin showing red flags.To put it bluntly, this anime adaptation went way over the speed limit in the beginning. It’s incredibly rushed and skipping many chapters to get to certain plot elements. Just for statistical references, the first four or so episodes adapted at least 25+ chapters. With 43 volumes, this didn’t come to me as a complete surprise. The staff probably wanted to cover the entire manga but by doing so, it also damages the original product as a whole. This glaring red flag told me that Karakuri Circus is a victim of modern day adaptations. What got me curious is why the show didn’t receive more episodes in the first place. Perhaps a split double cour could even remedy this a little but instead, we get a continuous triple cour of 36 episodes. If you think about it, that’s almost 11 chapters per episode if we go with the flow. Luckily, the anime doesn’t exactly go with such numbers but it still suffers from omission. As a fan of the manga, I’m rather dumbfounded.Onto the actual plot, Karakuri Circus seems to have a vision to dive deep into its background story. Events in the past heavily influences the present timeline with characters such as Shirogane based on past incarnations. What began 200 years ago has made powerful impact in the present story. However, the first few episodes didn’t follow such format. Instead, it focused more on our three protagonists attempting to live a normal life. Despite that, fate has linked them together with the past that’s practically inescapable. As more episodes progressed, there’s a so much revealed that it’s hard to take in all at once. This the second red flag of the anime. How can viewers be invested in so much content going on at once? Now, I do get that Karakuri Circus relies on character decisions. Some of these are so important that they change the outcome of the story. But really, it feels that the story goes into many directions rather than being focused in one direction. Unfortunately, that’s not all the problems it suffers.When it comes to characters, the cast itself begins to show weakness. Now on the surface, I do like our main characters. Masaru, Narumi, and Shirogane shares a unique bond together that’s hard to overlook in the beginning. There’s hints of deeper feelings between Narumi and Shirogane while Masaru and Shirogane also develops a close bond. The main problem though lies with its commitment to the characters. We are shown many flashbacks throughout the show that sometimes makes me forget our main characters. The first few episodes made me invest a lot into them but by the time half this show aired, that interest has greatly degenerated. That is, I don’t want to say the characters in the past are not important. On the contrary, they play huge roles such as the case with Francine, the Bai brothers, and members of the Saiga family. Two characters of the past also greatly resemble our main characters – Francine/Shirogane and Narumi/Bai Yin. There’s also emotional value poured into the relationships between certain characters. But as the more I watched the show, the more I felt detached with them. I wanted the anime to just be more focused in one direction and not jump back and forth between every episode. That seems a bit too much to ask because the anime adaptation had other ideas.But still, I do applaud Karakuri Circus for its expansive characters when it comes to diversity. While the anime adaptation suffers from rushed content, certain characters do make an impression. The Saiga family such as Shogi and Angelina are names that shouldn’t be forgotten easily during their arc. Members of the Midnight Circus has unique members with a variety of personalities. Furthermore, some of the antagonists in the show have impactful influences such as the Faceless Commander in later episodes. Hell, the Bai brother are responsible for causing a major story plot in the show – the Zonapha Syndrome. Known for its deadly stages, this syndrome is one of the most important elements in the entire series. So despite the story being rushed, it’s hard to deny that certain characters had great influence in the overall tone of the plot. If only the anime adaptation devoted more time on the plot to be more fluid and tolerable. Too bad.Founded in the August of 2014, studio VOLN had previously worked on Ushio and Tora. For its visual context, Karakuri Circus blends between old school art and new school. What I mean is that the show retains a style of the manga while also able to adapting it to modern standards. Character designs are crafted with precision and uniqueness. Every character seems to stand out on their own without feeling out of place. The most unique designs are the automatas, clowns, and circus acrobats. Many of the modern circus characters have a flamboyant look while the automata gives the impression of unique old school machines. Furthermore, I think praise should be given to the character expressions for being able to sell emotional content when it’s given the chance.

We venture beyond our comfort zones, adapting and adjusting to new environments. In the end, we become better versions of ourselves. However, for the shirogane (masters of magical puppets), this is not the case. Defined by their silver hair, slim figures, and seemingly ageless bodies, they’ve been fighting monsters for hundreds of years. Their reasoning for this lies within a traumatizing event from long ago; this event permanently affected them. While the seasons change, the shirogane stay the same. It's apparent in their fighting style (the manipulation of puppets). With the issues they confront, the shirogane insist on an approach that’s not only...unreliable but is also (more or less) outdated. To me, the shirogane are frozen in time.The same can be said of Karakuri Circus. Like the shirogane, this show is from a bygone era. July 9, 1997 was when Karakuri Circus first emerged, as the brainchild of mangaka Kazuhiro Fujita. And although it was recently adapted into an anime (thanks to Studio VOLN), the premise is typical of the era it hails from. At the outset, we’re introduced to Masaru Saiga (a timid soul with a big heart and a photographic memory), alongside his companions Narumi and Eleonore. Loyalty is established (and romance blossoms) as they voyage through a coming-of-age tale involving daddy issues, the power of friendship, and eventually saving the world. This did not grab my attention (at least, not at first). For me, the overarching story is redeemed when it connects to its various subplots, specifically the shirogane’s struggles against the automata.Here's where the magic unfolds. Masaru’s journey may be this show’s backbone, but it’s in the feud between these two factions that Karakuri Circus comes alive. Their various showdowns are engaging to watch, mostly thanks to composer Yuki Hayashi (he’s the brains behind the soundtracks for Haikyuu and My Hero Academia). It’s because of him that, for each action sequence, viewers are blessed with a colorful array of accordions, drums, and guitars. And the fights themselves are quite impressive. The puppets that the shirogane weaponize and maneuver are rendered in stunning CGI. Gaudy explosions often follow the attacks these fighters unleash (at one point, a column of fire erupts as lightning bolts dance around it). And the battles end stylishly; it’s mesmerizing to watch the automata crumble piece by piece, under grey ooze and hissing steam.Fight scenes are this show's pride and joy. However, what's said during these fight scenes isn't always as inspiring. As far as dialogue is concerned, there are certain areas I enjoy; the one-liners here are very much appreciated and the soul-stirring speeches are genuine highlights, especially in the final six episodes. On the other hand, this show is held back by a hamfisted screenplay; the dialogue is both excessive and redundant, often emphasizing the most obvious ideas. Karakuri Circus provides character development but not without pointlessly detailing the process. It presents ingenious tactics but not without long-winded explanations of how they work. It features personality traits (like Eleonore's weaknesses or a hospital patient's hobbies), but not without an extended monologue about them soon after. For most shonens, infodumping is a recurring issue, and Karakuri Circus is no exception.Ideally, these monologues would be reduced (if not removed entirely). Studio VOLN, though, were occupied elsewhere, with modifying the manga’s overall storyline. Looking to comply with the 36-episode format, they condensed the events of the source material, disposing of specific plot threads in the process. Among others, the Beast Tamer arc and the Kuroga Village training period were axed. Although it caused complaints (especially from fans of the manga), the differences, for the most part, aren’t too severe. To be clear, the editing process and the end result are by no means perfect, but they don't detract from the overall experience. By holding onto the original’s ideas and themes, Karakuri Circus remains true to Fujita’s vision.- - - - - - -It’s a mess. The table is cluttered with mess; it's practically submerged in folders, calculators, pencil shavings, ink stains, and rough sketches. However, Kazuhiro Fujita and his three assistants ignore this. An idea has caught their attention instead. “Aren’t there idiots who get excited just from being on a cliff?” Fujita wonders aloud. He then rises from his chair, gesturing with his hands to emphasize the point he’s making. After doing this, a voice intones, “For Fujita-san, if he’s not talking to people, then it appears he cannot progress in his work.”Kazuhiro Fujita is a featured guest on “Urasawa Naoki no Manben,” a 2015 documentary series that captures a mangaka’s journey in creating their material; it’s intended to provide a glimpse into the process’ inner workings. In the documentary, Fujita and his assistants are filmed at work for four days. When this is finished, Naoki Urasawa (Manben’s host) and Fujita convene to examine the footage.While doing so, they discuss a variety of manga-related topics. Naturally, the conversation shifts to detailing the early stages of Fujita’s career. At the age of 25, he was hired by Shonen Sunday and soon after he reviewed what they had to offer. Fujita scrutinized the magazine’s catalog, a lineup of sports stories and romantic comedies, and he wanted to invigorate the ranks with something new. In order to succeed, he derived inspiration from his childhood influences.Ever since his days growing up in Asahikawa, Fujita loved reading manga, especially shonens. At the time, he was entranced by series like Shotaro Ishinomori’s “Kamen Rider,” Go Nagai’s “Devilman,” and Ken Ishikawa’s “Getter Robo.” However, out of all his childhood influences, there was one that towered above the rest: Rumiko Takahashi’s “Yami wo Kakeru Manazashi.”“It was a short story with regular humans that fought the weird and won. I thought ‘Oh, I am really glad she drew something like this.’ Like, ‘This is just the kind of thing I want to read!’ It was the kind of thing that made me think ‘Manga’s amazing!’ And I think it was the thing that turned me on to doing manga”, - Kazuhiro Fujita- - - - - - -This idea would define him. Throughout his career of thirty years and counting, Fujita waged war against the unknown. In his stories, he would maneuver his everyman leads into confronting opponents of unnatural origin, like evil spirits (in Ushio to Tora), fairy-tale denizens (in Moonlight Act), and sentient haunted houses (in Souboutei Kowasubeshi). With Karakuri Circus, it’s the automata that adopt this role. However, there’s a crucial difference between this show and the rest of Fujita’s works. Beneath the speeches, the references to Chinese culture and the slapstick comedy lies Karakuri Circus’s true intent: to find common ground between the shirogane and automata through their goals. For the shirogane, that goal is learning from the past. After centuries of failure, they finally abandon their age-old stubbornness, which causes them to evolve both in combat (with a wider range of styles and tactics) and outside of it (with more openness in their personal relations). As for the automata, their purpose isn’t as detailed. There’s a backstory here but it’s a strange one, almost impossible to make sense of. Regardless, this show succeeds in providing both sides a cause worth fighting for. It’s not much but having this makes it easier to understand the automata.However, this show fails to humanize them. Excluding the Les Quatre Pioneers (the four oldest automata) and a few others, there's no reason for anyone to care about them. These guys are cartoonishly evil. They kill for sport, getting off on the worst of bloodbaths. In battle, their signature move is to take the children and slap them around before using them as bargaining chips. If children aren’t nearby, they’ll resort to removing women's clothing and gloating about it afterward. The automata are caricatures, plain and simple; they’re card-carrying villains, cruel for cruelty’s sake, cackling at the chaos they’ve created. And they’re not the only ones like this. In Karakuri Circus, almost every antagonist is written the same way. From Zenji Saiga (Masaru’s uncle) to episode 16’s suicidal samurai and even the main villain himself, they’re all reduced to stereotype, burdened with bloated egos and creepy facial expressions.This black-and-white worldview cripples the show's storytelling.

That said, there are lots of elements to Karakuri Circus that make it clear that it cut out a lot of stuff from the manga. This anime serves as a case study as to what happens when you adapt a great manga (or, at least, I assume it’s great based on what I’ve seen of the anime) from 42 volumes into 36 episodes. As you might imagine, the...result is a bit messy.If I were to choose two adjectives to describe Karakuri Circus, I would go with “creative” but “rushed”. The plot is full of all sorts of brilliant and entertaining ideas, but it breezes through them so quickly that few of them really hit you with the impact they deserve. This also applies to the characters of the show. This show has an enormous cast, but few of them get enough screen time. To the show’s credit, there are still many great ideas, moments and characters, but if either there was a greater number of episodes, or the focus of the 36 episodes we do have was more narrowed, then these would’ve been more effective as a result of being more thoroughly developed.The circus motif of the series is going to be hit or miss depending on your personal tastes, but I for one think it’s great. Karakuri Circus does a great job capitalizing on different elements of the circus, creating lots of unique and entertaining puppets to be fought throughout the series. The way they twist the joyful and comedic look of the circus into something much more abhorrent is very well done. If you are afraid of clowns, then these designs will definitely add to the atmosphere of the series.These designs, as well as the varied abilities of the puppets make the fights pretty entertaining. These fights are usually quite simple, but usually have an emotionally resonant idea or important stakes in the plot that comes with them. There is also always a tangible sense of tension once it becomes clear that this series isn’t afraid to kill off its characters. In many cases, however, these things feel like they could’ve hit harder if the characters involved had received more development, and things start to feel formulaic after a while. The animation is also pretty underwhelming.The character deaths feel particularly formulaic (with exceptions). This is perhaps where the incredibly fast-paced nature of the show hurts it the most. Because of this pace, character deaths happen so frequently that the deaths of minor characters don’t have the impact they ought to, and the more major deaths feel less shocking (though they still hit pretty hard).In terms of presentation, Karakuri Circus is pretty solid. As I said earlier, it has underwhelming animation, but it is still pretty nice, visually speaking, as a result of the puppet designs and the classic ‘90s aesthetic. As for the audio side of things, the BGM is pretty darn great, as are the opening and ending themes, and the voice actors do a nice job at conveying their characters.The most recurring theme throughout the series is that of smiling (and, by extension, laughter). While this may sound pretty cliché, it fits the series rather well, in large part due to the circus motif. After all, the point of the circus is to make people smile. This idea is twisted and perverted by the villains of the series, adding a lot more to this theme than you might expect. While it certainly also indulges in the cliché elements of this theme, the accompaniment of this dark parallel makes these moments feel richer. I can certainly say that this theme, and the show in general, succeeded in making me smile.Most of Karakuri Circus’ problems seem to come from how rushed it is. It oozes creativity and heart, but so much of it feels as though it could’ve been executed a lot better had it been given more episodes. I have yet to read the manga, so I am hesitant to recommend it, but I will say this: if the manga is truly like the anime but with a much slower pace, then I am reasonably confident that it will be an excellent read.So, should you watch Karakuri Circus? I would say that it depends on how interested you are in the series. If a battle shounen between mechanical puppets with a strong circus motif interests you enough that you are convinced it is worth your time, you should probably read the manga instead. However, if you are somewhat interested, but think that a 42-volume manga is too big of a commitment, then you should definitely check out the anime! Who knows? Perhaps you will like it enough that you will be convinced to read the manga? I certainly plan on reading it. result is a bit messy.If I were to choose two adjectives to describe Karakuri Circus, I would go with “creative” but “rushed”.

If a battle shounen between mechanical puppets with a strong circus motif interests you enough that you are convinced it is worth your time, you should probably read the manga instead. However, if you are somewhat interested, but think that a 42-volume manga is too big of a commitment, then you should definitely check out the anime! Who knows? Perhaps you will like it enough that you will be convinced to read the manga? I certainly plan on reading it.', 'Finally the 36 episode long anime has ended and it ended with a clean ending, not something that every anime does which always leaves an open ending, that the good part, the bad part about this anime was that to run for 36 episode was just too much of a chore, since we have to see a lot of back stories and info dump that were seemingly pseudo-science by nature, in one episode about the backstory of Yin and Bin it was 1758, that was the "" Renaissance"" that was the time that moden medicine was starting to develop in it\'s early stage, that was...the time when modernity was in it\'s infancy , so how did a Chinese guy like Bai  who traveled from China to Europe able to to created an virus or some kind of nanotech that gave people such disease like ZONAPHA , with tools that weren\'t  even invented and how did he develop a stone that can heal the same disease  when alchemy wasn\'t an accurate science, in fact the philosopher stone that them alchemist were developing never come to light , now I don;t know about you people but I beginning to think that the original creator of this thing, Fujita, Kazuhiro can be a bit ""NUTS"" when he came up with this kind of thing, but then again see how this in its manga form did was a success, but in its anime form, it does have a lotta plot holes that sometimes it can be annoying, especially when common sense was put aside for something elaborate that basically makes  it too stupid to comprehend , also those puppets that can move and think, WTF  they\'re just made out of wood or simple material , so how come they can do that , I mean it\'s not like that Bai aka Faceless to be able to develop ""Artificial Intelligence""  that was basically crazy, now don\'t tell me it\'s magic , cu\'z if it is then Masaru , Narumi, and Eleanor ought to be wizards or magic user. Art, basically since the anime debuted in the late 90\'s it wasn\'t  surprising that everything there were based in that era, but unfortunately, that idiot of the original creator, Fujita, Kazuhiro, should have included cellphones, since they exist already in the late 90\'s like that fold up phone, also, on the character side of this thing basically has too many antagonist and too many protagonist , yet thought it would only be Masru, Narumi, and Eleanor, the addition of other support like Cuy, Vilma, Pataleon and others were just too much to comprehend that sometimes you felt lost as to who is who around here, so without anymore bullshit, here were my ratings for this anime:Story-Good 7: Since , there is that plot about a grow up like Narumi saving Masaru from the greedy Saiga family , it was good at first but this change when Narumi disappears and that\'s where the pseudo sci-fi thing begins as the world was threatened by a disease called ZONAPHA and the attack of the puppets  that can think without any AI tech in them.Art- fair 6: There was limited fanservices and mostly were about them puppets with a  hotch·potch of design that were just too lame to to consider cu\'z they\'re not even funny.Enjoyment- Fair 6: This anime maybe interesting,  but I can\'t just ignore the plot holes.Overall- Good 7: That\'s for the clean ending. the time when modernity was in it\'s infancy , so how did a Chinese guy like Bai  who traveled from China to Europe able to to created an virus or some kind of nanotech that gave people such disease like ZONAPHA , with tools that weren\'t  even invented and how did he develop a stone that can heal the same disease  when alchemy wasn\'t an accurate science, in fact the philosopher stone that them alchemist were developing never come to light , now I don;t know about you people but I beginning to think that the original creator of this thing, Fujita, Kazuhiro can be a bit ""NUTS"" when he came up with this kind of thing, but then again see how this in its manga form did was a success, but in its anime form, it does have a lotta plot holes that sometimes it can be annoying, especially when common sense was put aside for something elaborate that basically makes  it too stupid to comprehend , also those puppets that can move and think, WTF  they\'re just made out of wood or simple material , so how come they can do that , I mean it\'s not like that Bai aka Faceless to be able to develop ""Artificial Intelligence""  that was basically crazy, now don\'t tell me it\'s magic , cu\'z if it is then Masaru , Narumi, and Eleanor ought to be wizards or magic user.

Although, the story development could be improved because in most of the episodes that I've seen so far, certain arcs are skipped through and multiple new characters are being introduced in almost every episode with little to no introductions. With that being said, the story is interesting and you'll get used to the fast paced development.Art (9/10)The art is beautiful, reminds me of art styles from older anime's.

Oh! Specially to remind you what happens when you cock-block someone. The character development is amazing and very strong and so is the plot. It has a bunch of mysteries that all get revealed, and through the story there are two full circles that are nicely done through characterization. What do I mean by that? Well by the end of the series you will get why.This is a story heavily involving puppets and circuses and alchemy. What Puppets, revenge, circuses, alchemy and forms of immortality or reincarnation do not interest...you? Then, this is not for you.The music is great and so is the art and the fights are very good. If you have seen Ushio to Tora, then you would most likely like this one too, since well...its the same author. By the same logic, after you see this series and will like to watch something somewhat similar but not really similar then watch Ushio to Tora ( the newer adaptation). Both of them are after very old mangas which both happen to have very good adaptations.The only reason I do not give it a 10 is because arc 2, is super duper rushed, so very rushed a lot of people drop it before finishing this series. I love stories where plot is heavily important, characters are connected not just because but because of strong writing. This series embodies that, but get ready because there are so many mysteries, you won't believe there is still more. If you still cannot decide see the first opening of the anime. you?

But oh boi that it took me for one heck of a ridePeople might enjoy it but I hate it. Its like a long bad roller-coaster ride  which you think you'll enjoy initially but as it goes on, you keep feeling sicker and sicker and by the end of the ride, you start throwing up. And it's also so unpredictable but in such a way that you start questioning yourself that why did you start watching this. There's is just too...much happening in such a short time that it becomes hard to connect the current episode to the previous one.All in all, I'd stay away from its if I were you. Binge it after it's done broadcasting as that way it might make more sense. That's if you are desperate enough as there are many other better shows you can watch.

If you like shonen anime like I do, especially the kind that hit you in the feels and hold no punches, I highly recommend it.Karakuri Circus is an adaptation of a shonen manga from the 90s, coming from the same author of Ushio to Tora. It tells the story of Masaru, a kid raised by a rich family who just inherited a big fortune, since the father of the household died in a car crash. As a result, Masaru is being pursued by two separate groups of puppeteers who control super strong puppets...that can kill people at the drop of a hat.I'm not sure I should point this out, but this is a hot blooded, over the top series where some suspension of disbelief is required.With that out of the way, I'd like to go over both the series' strengths as well as its weaknesses, specifically when it comes to being a condensed, 36 episode adaptation of its 43 volume long manga which might be the reason this anime gained only a so-so reputation (I assure you, it's not as bad as it sounds).But first, let me gush on the things I love about this show.--The Characters--They are vibrant, have strong personalities and leave a lasting impression with each having a compelling character arc. The main trio have a very heartwarming familyesque dynamic (the fact that they're separated a lot of time makes it even more powerful in a way) and specifically Masaru's growth throughout the series ties in very nicely to the progression of the story and the details he keeps uncovering about himself as well as the antagonists of this series.. This also includes a great deal of its secondary characters, which the series is not afraid to kill off and kills off meaningfully, making sure that their deaths are cathartic and tie in to the themes of the series. This also includes some of its villains.--The Story---I like how even some of the smallest details from early episodes are reincorporated much later in the series as an important plot point (like the food Elanore made or the blood she let Masaru drink, how Masaru's dad died, etc' etc'), and how all the threads come together in the end. I like the fast but steady pace with new revelations happening every so often and tension staying present for its entire run. Not to mention that it has one of the most satisfying and powerful conclusions I've seen in a while.--The Themes-- (spoilers)The circus, puppet and clown motif of this series fit very nicely in to the themes of the story - a story of human emotions, free will and happiness and what they actually mean. The series main antagonist couldn't accept that the love of his life didn't return his feelings. Even his goons (the Automata) were originally created to make that person happy. When that didn't work, he became desperate and manipulated his love's emotions by force. Forcing her to love him back (quite literally) like a puppet. This also ties in to the disease that is spread in the series which has people feeling pain when they can't make others around them laugh (the same pain the antagonist felt),  which is the job of a entertainers like the ones in the circusIn contrast Eleonore's character has been forced and trained to have no emotions whatsoever. To never smile, only to have a blank stare. Of course all of  that changes once she meets and creates a bond with Narumi and Masaru.The point is that happiness should not be acquired through any means,  human emotions aren't something to be puppeteer-ed. It should come naturally from inter personal relationships as well as positive or negative experiences that will shape them. Which is demonstrated in the series through the strengthening bonds between its main characters.Those are just the main examples of how this idea is explored. Throughout the series we get an exploration of this theme through various characters with vastly different perspectives on these subjects, depending on their past (and present) experiences, as well as a resolution to it by the end of the series.--The Visuals--The series has an old-school and semi-GAR looking art-style which I love, but at the same time it looks very polished, clean and with thin outlines so it won't turn off people who are accustomed to the modern look. The animation is somewhat limited but that's exactly the style it's going for. This show prioritizes good framing instead of movement and it does an excellent job of that. The action, while light on strategy, is very well choreographed and each character fights differently. It puts great emphasis on the decisive blows and body/puppet parts blowing apart in each battle with cool visual effects, making them feel very satisfying to watch. It's directed by the same guy who directed Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the new Ushio to Tora adaptation, and enhancing limited animation as well as great fighting choreography seems to be his expertise. Plus, the amount of action this series has gives Dragon Ball Z a run for its money. The volume of violence and scary imagery is also quite high for a shonen.It may look a little stiff in places and it may appear to use its style as an excuse for taking animation shortcuts on occasion. In addition there's some light use of CGI on some of the puppets, but overall the visuals are pretty awesome.P. S. - I also wanna point out that the female characters are hawwwt beyond description.--The Audio--Emotionally powerful voice acting (albeit a little cheesy), great intense rock music mixed with circus themed sounds and bombastic sound effects really compliment this series perfectly and enhances every set piece and emotional beat. The OPs and EDs are solid and range from rock to tencno pop, and I specifically love the 2nd op for its opening and closing guitar bits that really make you pumped to watch the episode and the 1st op for sounding very circus-like and is later used as the final ED.From here on I'll try to go over the story structure pointing out its highs and lows as an adaptation without going in to any specifics. So if you consider that a spoiler then just skip to the last three paragraphs.---------------------------The series has a very strong start. Its first 4 episodes... hell I'd even say its first seven episodes - are great. They introduce the characters perfectly, all of which work off each other very well. The story progresses at a blazing fast pace at this point but everything is coherent and easy to follow..Episodes 8 through 14 is where the true weaknesses start to show and honestly I'd say this is where the series is at its weakest.Trying not to go in to specifics here, but the main characters get separated at this point and the series struggles to tell this story by juggling between two different perspectives which results in it neglecting both. To the point it becomes very obvious that the anime is skipping over material.Characters are quickly introduced and quickly killed off after they served their purpose.It's' clear that there are several story beats missing as well, when a character is in one location in one episode, and then in a faraway location in the next episode with some voice over to fill in the gaps. It also tends to just jump ahead and then retroactively show a brief flashback that hastily shows us what we've missed (which happens at least twice). Not to mention huge doses of exposition that are a little too much to process in such a short amount of time.With that said, this section is still really cool, but it could've been so much better (and it probably is, in the manga).Episode 15 feels like more of a fresh start with my only gripe being that it didn't seem to segway in to it all that well.Episodes 16 through 19 is basically a huge info dump through flashbacks. It's a little convoluted and mildly confusing in places but is overall far more satisfying and well handled than some of the previous episodes and by the end of it we get a clear picture with an unraveling of its mystery (not to mention that it's pretty effective emotionally).Episodes 20 through 29 is a very good mix of action and good storytelling with more revelations and further development of characters that were properly introduced before and didn't simply appear out of thin air. These episodes feel like the climax of the series but is actually only setting up the real climax which is episodes 30 through 36. All of which were handled well in terms of pacing and coherency. The entirety of the latter two thirds o the series are actually even more reasonably paced than the very strong first 7 episodes, which culminates in to a solid and powerful finale.This part still has some minor hiccups here and there, which may or may not be exclusive to the adaptation. Like a lack of foreshadowing for certain things (*Cough* spaceship *cough*) or Narumi's character arc being a little hard to track for a long period of time and some deaths and new revelations that happen very close to one another.But this was definitely the high point of the series as it should be.-------------------------------So overall the adaptation seems to have rushed through the first third in favor of the latter two thirds. I can imagine that watching this weekly while it was airing must've been more frustrating and harder to follow than watching it at your own pace like I did.Despite some issues here and there, in my humble opinion Karakuri Circus is one of the best shonen series to come out this decade (alongside Hunter x Hunter and possibly Dr. Stone). It has interesting things to say, the characters are memorable, it's complete (sort of), it's dark but also uplifting, and most importantly - it's very entertaining.It'll probably become more of a cult classic that will gain a following over the years, but sadly won't break in to the mainstream. that can kill people at the drop of a hat.I'm not sure I should point this out, but this is a hot blooded, over the top series where some suspension of disbelief is required.With that out of the way, I'd like to go over both the series' strengths as well as its weaknesses, specifically when it comes to being a condensed, 36 episode adaptation of its 43 volume long manga which might be the reason this anime gained only a so-so reputation (I assure you, it's not as bad as it sounds).But first, let me gush on the things I love about this show.--The Characters--They are vibrant, have strong personalities and leave a lasting impression with each having a compelling character arc.

It was another work from the mangaka behind Ushio to Tora, which while rushed as an anime I still enjoyed. So with Karakuri Circus coming out I knew I had to check it out.The first episode actually blew away my expectations. It looked good, really good. It kind of gave me this Hunter x Hunter vibe which is a high compliment. For the next few episodes the story continued at an appropriate pace and any worries I had for the series were at the back of my mind. All was...going well and then they reached a point where they crammed in a completely new story line without any setup or warning. Now, I have not read the manga so I am viewing this series from an anime only perspective, but even I could tell they were leaving quite a bit out. Because of this, the story moves at a break neck pace introducing new story lines and characters so fast you could get whiplash. At some point I just accepted that this is going to be the norm and looked for other things that I could latch onto and enjoy.One of those things was the characters, which kept me from dropping this series. Over the course of 36 episodes I became invested in their development. The original three as I like to dub it consisting of Narumi, Shirogane, and Masaru were the ones that kept me engaged when the story went out of control. Even as new characters were being thrown in my face without warning, I was still able to find something I liked about them. Without a doubt the characters are one of the saving graces for this series. However, its not the true savior.Ladies and gentlemen please rise for Bump of Chicken. I\'ve been around anime long enough to know that a good soundtrack can elevate a series. There are some anime out there that are defined solely by their sound. I believe that Karakuri Circus could evolve to be one of those series. Primarily with regards to its first set of OP\'s and ED\'s. The opening song to Karakuri Circus is one of the best opening songs of the year and I do not take that statement lightly. The staff of Karakuri Circus even reused the song for their 3rd and final ED, which just proves how good of a song it is. As the series winded down it got to a point where I was watching the episode just so I could listen to Bump of Chicken again. The first ED ""Marionette"" was also a pleasure to listen to.As for the art and animation, it wasn\'t the best but it wasn\'t bad either. At 36 episodes long its difficult to maintain a high animation quality level so I can understand if some episodes or scenes are not up to snuff. The designs for the characters gave me some strong Hunter x Hunter 2011 vibes. Not sure if they share the same character designer but it would be a nice touch.Overall, Karakuri Circus moves incredibly fast for a story and will often times leave you scratching your head when they introduce new plot elements and characters without warning. Despite this the staff tries to make the ride as enjoyable as possible by always making sure there is something interesting going on. The characters will come to grow on you and the music will have you coming back for more. going well and then they reached a point where they crammed in a completely new story line without any setup or warning.

I believe that Karakuri Circus could evolve to be one of those series. Primarily with regards to its first set of OP\'s and ED\'s. The opening song to Karakuri Circus is one of the best opening songs of the year and I do not take that statement lightly. The staff of Karakuri Circus even reused the song for their 3rd and final ED, which just proves how good of a song it is. As the series winded down it got to a point where I was watching the episode just so I could listen to Bump of Chicken again. The first ED ""Marionette"" was also a pleasure to listen to.As for the art and animation, it wasn\'t the best but it wasn\'t bad either. At 36 episodes long its difficult to maintain a high animation quality level so I can understand if some episodes or scenes are not up to snuff. The designs for the characters gave me some strong Hunter x Hunter 2011 vibes. Not sure if they share the same character designer but it would be a nice touch.Overall, Karakuri Circus moves incredibly fast for a story and will often times leave you scratching your head when they introduce new plot elements and characters without warning. Despite this the staff tries to make the ride as enjoyable as possible by always making sure there is something interesting going on. The characters will come to grow on you and the music will have you coming back for more.', ""This adaption is pitiful its pathetic compared to the manga and to me after a fair 20 episodes it was straight up unwatchable and I've watched quite a lot of amines.You might be wondering whats the problem?It's the plot, it doesn't seem to be following any of the manga at all and instead jumps from one chapter to 3 chapters after that. Secondly, its horrendous rushed, it chopped around 15 chapters and skewed it awkwardly into a single episode. If you haven't read the manga most likely you'll get lost after around 3 episodes.The only saving grace was the art, it clean and smooth. The...music and osts were about as average as it would get. music and osts were about as average as it would get."", ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, because I needed to address a certain disturbing plot points and events and I can’t analyse them the without mentioning the story. So don’t read if you haven’t watched the series yet.This anime plotline can be considered an epitome of unhealthy and abusive relationship. The way it equates a constant abuse and violence to love is not only outrageous and wrongful, but even criminal. Of course I’m talking about ‘romance’ between Narumi and Eleonore. There are many examples of bad-written pairings in anime in general, but this one beats them all. It’s a classical case of abusive relationship when a girl...becomes dependent on her abuser and even develops a Stockholm syndrome. It was so freaking disgusting to watch this being presented as lovey-dovey story, made me sick.Firstly, Eleonore is a typical girl who can fall into this sort of abuse. She said herself that she was very lonely almost for a century. She had only constant fighting in her life. Narumi and Masaru were literally the first people who became her friends, at least that’s what she thought about Narumi. He treated her normally at first - again, classical sign of abuser. Every unhealthy relationship starts on a good note. Every abuser behaves genially and even kindly before they show their true colors. They don’t start mistreating their victim until later on. So, Eleonor didn’t have any kind of close romantic relationship before, she simply didn’t know how it goes and what was normal and not for it. And when Narumi started to yell at her constantly, repeat that he’d kill her, humiliate her, ignore her and overall treat her extremely rude, Eleonore had no life experience to distinguish if it was okay or not. She turned into an exemplary victim who runs after her abuser even when he shoved her off. The behaviour of such victims are usually very childlike, and that’s natural, because people who fall into such abuse are generally kind, infantile and naive. Just like Eleonore. For a lonely girl who didn’t know any human amity before, it was enough for Narumi to act a little friendly to her in the beginning - and she became easily attached to him. Then she was so afraid to lose that little warmth and kindness she tasted, that she was ready to endure any following insults and mistreatment from him. Also she made a typical mistake of a kind-hearted person - she judged Narumi by her own standards. So she was sure that if he hated her, that must be her fault and not because he is a revolting aggressive bastard. To put it simply, Eleonore couldn't discern that such treatment wasn't normal, and she should just tell Narumi to back off.For the most part of the series their relationship appeared as a pure hell for Eleonore. She went through incessant yelling, threats for her life, even beating, overall disdainful treatment, hate and ignore from Narumi. Notice the sharp contrast in her communication with her automaton followers, comrades from the circus troupe or Masaru after she spoke with Narumi. It was a classical illustration when a girl in abusive relationship with her jerk boyfriend meets her friends. They all were so kind to her, always were glad to see her and ready to help. Compare it to constantly angry and aggressive Narumi who could at most give her a short orders or tell her to shut up otherwise he’ll kill her while making furious faces. And after all of this she still continued to beg for his attention and repeat that she loves him. That was absolutely nauseating and disturbing, but also presented an example of sick relationship when victim has a Stockholm syndrome. She became attached to her abuser and protected his right to torment her psychologically. Yes, it’s definitely isn’t healthy state of mind. Eleonore needed help. But what she got instead of it? Idiotic cheering from all her supposed friends for this pairing.That was another big problem in representation of this ship. Anyone who has eyes could have noticed that Narumi treated her absolutely unfairly, brutally and plain dangerously for her life. But not only they ignored it like it was a normal thing, they encouraged this relationship. Up to the point when circus troupe shoved them both into one train carriage so they could ‘enjoy’ their time together. While they all saw that Narumi rudely and hatefully spoke to Eleonore literally a moments before. And this was considered as ‘love’ by people around. That’s the most disgusting thing in this anime. It’s one thing to show horrible treatment of a character, but it gets on another level of abhorrent advocacy of abuse if you make your characters to perceive it as something normal and to further encourage their relation instead of helping Eleonore to get out of it. The author clearly enjoyed abusing her. In fact in this repulsive depiction of a ‘couple’ dynamics I see his own fetishes and an idea about his perfect woman. She should be absolutely submissive, complaisant and kind despite any form of mental of physical violence her partner would cause her. She should express no discontent ever and blame all hate she receives on her own mistakes even if they are non-existent. She should never hold a grudge against her abusive partner and always rejoice from the tiniest bits of attention he gives her, even if it’s just a rude shout. Of course she also must be a beauty and know her place in the kitchen - remember that repugnant moment when Narumi once again aggressively complained that he didn’t like train food and Eleonore jumped up and suggested to make him something, but then realised there was no kitchen around. That was a minutes after he rabidly yelled at her for the hundredth time. Did the troupe kept them in a separate carriage and didn’t want to disturb them for this kind of romantic lovely moments they could share?In my eyes the author of this trash must be an old pervert who simply made Eleonore in an image of his ideal waifu. And his self-insert in the story must be Narumi of course. His attempt to normalise mental violence and abuse in ‘romantic’ relationship is absolutely pathetic. I guess he couldn’t find a woman in real life who he can yell at, berate and mistreat while she would obediently accept it all and blame only herself. So he took it all out into his manga. Naturally, any sane woman wouldn’t tolerate such crap, so he needed an archetype of a vulnerable and broken victim. Notice how not only Narumi, but all other people except for Masaru abused Eleonore when they thought she was guilty for spreading of Zonapha syndrome. And she resignedly accepted their hate and even physical violence against her without attempting to justify herself. Btw they didn’t even apologize later. She is a bullied and maltreated victim, ideally fit for abusive relationship where she can’t raise a voice against any aggression towards her. The author didn’t give her a single chance to stand for herself. Of course, he didn’t want her to defend herself against all unfair hate from Narumi or others because he takes pleasure in torturing her mentally and physically.Even more infuriating was an episode when even Eleonore’s closest and most caring person accepted that Narumi ‘loves’ her. I’m talking about Guy and his little duel with Narumi. Guy was the only exception from the cheering crowd which approved this trashy pairing. He actually stood up for Eleonore and at last said that constantly threaten to kill her is not normal. He even started a fight with Narumi and demanded that he stop his threats towards Eleonore. Narumi never agreed to cease it, but in one moment Guy just ‘realised’ that Narumi is apparently in love with Eleonore. Literally nothing indicated it. Narumi was spitefully yelling how he hates Eleonore as usual. And then Guy decided for some reason that it must be love and stopped fighting. What the heck was that? Does the author really think that telling how you’d kill a girl with a mad angry face is a sign of love? In what universe? His sick projections on how a man should be treating a woman he apparently loves is so nasty and distasteful, it even leads to such idiotic situations where Guy suddenly takes a hateful words for lovely confession apparently. He raised Eleonore since she was a child, cared for her deeply, but then agreed to leave her to a man directly telling him that he’d kill Eleonore? That’s a joke of a plot.Also notice how Eleonore’s opinion is not even taken into consideration. She is regarded as a trophy that Narumi or someone else could gain. Even another one of her close attendants, Pantalone, said absolutely hideous thing which I suppose expresses author’s own view on women and their place in relationship in general. He said that Eleonore ‘chose who will own her’. And that was Narumi of course, he is supposed to own her and that must be love from the author’s point of view. That’s the most unhealthy and disgusting take on romance I saw. He described slavery, not love, and the fact that Eleonore chose that slavery herself doesn’t equate to a voluntary choice, because she already became a repressed victim by that time and couldn’t think straight. That’s how author views it, if the woman is in relationship with someone, she belongs to him literally, he can do anything with his property and treat her however he likes. And she must obediently take it all and be grateful for any abuse, don’t forget.Another example of this disturbing way of thinking was the main conflict between the two brothers on a subject of who loved Eleonore first. It doesn’t matter who fell in love with her first. Only thing that matters is who she wanted to be with, because she is not your property that someone can claim. But the author obviously has his imaginary manly ‘code of honour’ according to which you shouldn’t ‘take’ the woman of your pal even if he is not dating her, but already fell for her. She is then considered his own and you shouldn’t interfere. What the woman herself wants of course doesn’t matter to the author and men who think like him. Later on this mindset showed again when Faceless asked Masaru why did he gave up on Eleonore and conceded to Narumi. And Masaru said that’s because Narumi loved her first. Again this BS, like from a cheap shounen romance or a primitive soup opera where girls rival over the main character and one of them concedes to another. Except here this trite soap opera situation was projected on guys and a girl. It doesn’t matter how many people loved Eleonore before if she has sympathy for one certain person. Not even talking about the fact that Narumi’s treatment of Eleonor is not love at all. Notice how they all only say that’s it’s unfair when you steal a girl if someone else loved her first, not because she didn’t want you. It’s unfair to steal from your buddy and good guys like Masaru shouldn’t do it, that’s the principle from which all this nonsense comes from. The woman doesn’t even have a say in this matter. Seriously, it’s known that Japan still has archaic view on relationships (that’s part of their demographic problem), but trying to romanticize a view on woman as a voiceless property is abominable no matter how you sugarcoat it.Speaking of Masaru, he actually was a very kind and understanding person. He could even make peace with Faceless himself. Just imagine if Narumi went to the station instead, he’d just rush into battle and never would be able to know the method to stop the virus. Masaru’s kindness saved them all in the end. And he genuinely adored Eleonore. I think they could very happily live together as a brother and sister, since his love was more brotherly in the end if you exclude all the interference that Faceless did to his mind. But his friendly and caring attitude towards Eleonore was conveniently pushed away so nothing would hinder her pairing with Narumi. Sadly, even Masaru wasn’t completely free of author’s rotten moral, remember the advise to smile in response to bullying in school instead of beating the abusers. Even though Masaru himself learned a couple of combat techniques already. This mindset of non-resistance to violence is extremely dangerous and is propagated only by abusers themselves. Every sane person should resist violence towards him or her and not joyfully accept it. It’s utterly twisted and corrupted logic, and if the author insert such behaviour patterns in the manga directed mostly at teenagers, he is just abuser himself and teaching his readers how to become an ideal obedient victims.In the end the author tried to justify Narumi’s behaviour by his loss of memory, but when he regained his memory in the train nothing has changed. He knew already that Eleonore wasn’t an automata, he had literally no reasons to be rude and aggressive to her, but instead of immediately asking for forgiveness for all the crap that he has done and said to her, he continued to treat her like an enemy. That’s obviously because the memory loss and his mistrust to Eleonore were merely pretext for abuse. Even when he was sure that she is his ally, he behaved like a jerk with her. Because the author only needed a formal excuse for all mistreatment and violence towards Eleonore, it never had a reasonable basis in the first place. So, the plot coherency never mattered, Narumi continued to abuse her with no cause for it except for his own nasty personality, and then in one second he suddenly realized that he ‘loves’ her, hence happy end. What a load of BS.All in all it’s not just bad written story with logical fallacies, it was intentionally propagating the idea that woman should know her place and never talk back and oppose a mental violence. The author also spread the idea that the biggest happiness for girl is to be in relationship and later marry a rude and aggressive gorilla-man. Narumi is like an embodiment of toxic masculinity. Notice, how Eleonor never had her own interests or goals in mind except for craving for Narumi. The author stripped her from any sign of an independent personality. And what’s the most detestable in this series, as I already mentioned, the author tried to present all this criminal maltreatment and abuse as something normal and romantic. It was so freaking disgusting and hideous. A woman doesn’t need some abusive boyfriend to be happy - in fact, she doesn’t need a man to become happy at all. She doesn’t need an ‘owner’ for herself, her world shouldn’t revolve around a man. She is not a property that you could argue over with your mate. No one can claim her only because he ‘loved her first’. Eleonore was a victim of mental violence and would have been thousands times happier if her friends beat up Narumi and helped her to get away from him. She was created as a dream girl for any sick abuser and domestic tyrant. And Narumi was behaving like one for the most part of the series. That’s your main characters who should be an example to follow? Deeply revolting.If author really wanted to make her happy he should have given her a reunion with her family. Her father could have been healed and then she would live with him, Guy and Masaru as a brothers. Instead we had that rushed idiotic ending and Masaru was demoted to a merely brainless fanatic of Narumi. Seriously, the author even gave him the same job in the end, I suppose to show how much Masaru admired that bastard. It’s like the author created a cult for Narumi and this crappy pairing. Even the only person who had much more developed relationship with Eleonore - Masaru - was turned to his worshipper. Absolutely trashy and nonsensical ending just like the whole story. I don’t believe it and I don’t believe for a second that Narumi has changed. He is the same abuser he had been for the whole series, so does the author. He actually destroyed his another work, Ushio and Tora, in a similar way. It started as an interesting adventure, but then he began to shove poorly written and irrelevant romance into it, which turned plot into garbage. No wonder a person with such views on women and relationship can’t write romance to save his life.I hope we won't get any more anime adaptations for manga from that idiot Fujita.

It had some pretty good points and a lot of bad, but let's look at the good first.I liked some of the characters in Karakuri circus. The protagonists were well established and developed. They had back...stories I could sympathize with and I was somewhat invested in their growth. The animation was okay, not spectacular, but okay. I liked that they did a bump of chicken song, so that was exciting.And now, the bad. THE PLOT! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IN GOD'S RIDICULOUSLY POLLUTED EARTH WAS GOING ON??? It was so convoluted, it felt like the equivalent of your earphones getting entangled in your pocket. While I could follow what was happening from a literal standpoint, nothing made sense to me. Some story choice just seemed beyond ridiculous and the resolution just seemed off. I liked that they had a philosophy (what it is to be human and what makes a human being), but they didn't present it in a way that was remotely intriguing to me.I also really had little patience for the villains. In a battle anime where there are supposedly epic fights, we get excited for the fight between good and evil mostly because we know both their stories. Ichigo vs Ulquiorra was a classic fight not simply because it had good animation, it was a good fight because we 'knew' both characters, who they were and what they represented. In Karakuri circus, strong enemies just popped out of nowhere and started spouting philosophy which made no sense to me.I also didn't care for the romance element. I love a good romance story, but this one sucked. I wasn't even rooting for any of them. Same with some character deaths. Some were pretty unnecessary and added nothing to the story (tbf some did). It ended as well as such an anime could and I guess you could say the antagonist had a realistic reason for being who he was (even tho it was dumb). If you have some weird project to work on, this is the perfect anime to play in the background. stories I could sympathize with and I was somewhat invested in their growth.

But reality turned into a nightmare. I hate this anime sincerely, it manages to worsen the original material in every way, I have nothing against the manga of karakuri circus, I even think the manga a masterpiece, but this anime drives me mad.At first it seemed very harmless, but this anime cut...super important details soon after, the introduction of Narumi about his illness is forgotten and turned into a joke, the fear of Masaru being a person alone (including important point of the manga later), the fail worldbuilding of the karakuri mansion, and a ridiculous ending of the first arc, seriously that they traded a huge, sharp stone for lumps of wood?THIS DONT MAKE THE LESS SENSE, even more as Masaru survives a fire.The next arc is cruelly perforated and summed up in an idiotic way, nakamichi circus has a poor characterization in this anime, empty characters, conflicts removed, and all of them influence who masaru becomes in the future, Liese had a 1-volume bow itself, here it does not exist, it simply becomes a bad character. The start of the arc Automata can be even worse, narumi wake up at the hospital zonarpha even makes sense, but this leave questions unanswered, how the automatons have heard of him without him at least act before? Guy is a wasted character and poorly featured, he looks like a serious character than the fun character himself that was in the manga, making things rotten, all the characterization and importance of Lucille was cut because an incompetent screenwriter did not think that skipped an important arc (yes, France), Vilma is one of the few characters introduced in an acceptable way, even if they cut the development of it. As if they were not enough remove more characters in the nakamichi, they remove the George, who was the important piece in the Zonarpha Hospital, including he had confrontations that were cut. The part of China, was horrible, they adapted in the worst possible way, Liang became a nobody, they removed the introduction from her, they removed all the DRAMA she had, they removed the confrontation with the dog shirogane, and at the last moment, they do battle in the mountain look ridiculous and rushed, the midnight circus arc is a giant shit, they cut the VIKING, the German, the Russian... They gave shallow depths to the shiroganes, and all this leanes towards the worst development of Narumi, then several deaths were din't impact (and totally fillers moments), THE LUCILLE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WASTED CHARACTER, how do you want me to care about the character if they do not even build it right? Its end is ridiculous, this arc ends simply in THE HALF! THEY DIN'T ADAPT THE END, they were in vol 21 and cut to events of vol 29, destroying all Lore of Karakuri.Now we focus again on Masaru and I still say that his journey is rushed here, until it went well in the revelations, but the scenes began to get more stupid, leaving the characters idiots, until they were adapting the Saiga bow well, only that the anime has self-destructed, involving Eleonore in the middle, okay it makes sense for her to look for him, but her arrival comes much later, there's no logic to it here, to just rush the plot, and in fact they did it. They removed scenes of Masaru discovering about his father's whereabouts FOR AN IMBECILE AND USELESS PERSECUTION of Guy, as if that were not the worst, the Masaru simply falls off the cliff, fainting and returning to memories of the past, THIS IS STUPID AND THAT DOES NOT MAKE SOME SENSE, is so stupid that it becomes offensive(is a filler scene, but one of the worst I've seen), is useless, even because Masaru wakes up in the house anyway (error of continuity). The revelation of Faceless was still reasonable, although they cut important information, the problem is that after that point the anime part pro final arc, they skipped a whole arc that served as development of Masaru to go to the final bow, dude fuck this anime, it's ironic the fact that Masaru cares about peoples he's never seen in his life, while in the manga he cared because they helped him, and now we're off to the final arc.Suddenly the anime want to characterize Liese, this is so bad because the anime has not even built her story before, apart from the mistakes of continuity between Masaru change clothes, Masaru only uses that green coat on the arch of Kuroga Village ( but haha \u200b\u200bthey cut the arc again), the anime still tries to sell a redemption of the automata, HOW CAN I HAVE A REDEMPTION OF CHARACTERS THAT HAVE ONLY HAD 1/5 SCREEN TIME? This is useless, you just do not care about the character or anything. After this introduction the anime again tries to pregrar development in a character that we never had (Liang, George and Guy), the worst that have a nice battles, but an anime not only lives struggles to sustain itself, George had a horrible characterization in the anime. Later we see the battle in the castle of Faceless, where Liese appears to be a huge joke of the anime forcing itself to be interesting, the confrontation of Masaru and Faceless has no impact whatsoever, it is totally harsh, its psychological battle too, some infodump is up added here, but it only reminds me of how wasted the Aqua Vitae concept in the anime, Masaru already knows how to control puppets, and he took MONTHS(manga) in the kuroga village... Nothing here makes sense, with the unfolding of the plot they insert a character who tells how he met Narumi, but here's the problem, showing Narumi flashbacks in a certain arc, and you know what that means? ANIME HAS ADAPTED EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPENED, totally out of order leaving a huge hole in the story, the staff writers do not care about the story.Narumi and Shirogane's relationship is bad, the anime cuts off moments they both talked at Nakamichi Circus, they put a SUPER IMPORTANT character on the plot and turn it into a nobody, Guy's death is really beautiful, if the anime shows the kind of person that he really is, I would love to see this, Guy was a sarcastic man, and in the anime he does not pass any of that. Vilma's death too, she's a character wasted in the plot, I no longer care about her, and her death did not take anything away from me. The fight of Nakamichi family automatons was fortunately very well conducted, I felt immersed to a character for the first time, after Colombine had the worst destiny in this anime, its relation with Masaru is totally obfuscated and mounted only here. The last battle with Narumi and Masaru is really pleasant to see, it was the only episode of the anime that I was happy, although hurried, the outcome of Narumi and Eleonore was also cool, but things get worse going forward, the last battle is terribly punctured and summarized in a few words, which harms all the time, because of the rushed rhythm, the villain has a poor character development, the final scenes are the Masaru telling Eleonore to sing, SERIOUS THAT HER DON'T QUESTION BECAUSE HAVE TO SING ? This is stupid enough to make me mad, Jin's ending was cool, but what good is it to do something beautiful if your script sucks? One does not survive just from epic ost.the end of my review, the living proof that this anime does not care about any characters presented is the ending, the end of the manga shows the outcome of all the characters in the series, showing its consequences and what happened, NOW IN THAT PIECE OF SHIT, THEY SO ANIMATED THE NARUMI, ELEONORE AND MASARU ENDING! Forget the other characters that existed, Liang, Liese, nakamichi brothers... Everything is gone, I hate this anime from the bottom of my heart, this anime is useless, it did not deserve to exist at all. Maybe a little bit, it was the anime that boosted the new manga scans, I'm grateful they continued to translate the manga, it's really good to read the full story. If you want to see a shounen like Fullmetal Alchemist or something that shows you the true entertainment, just read the manga from Karakuri Circus, I strongly recommend, do not watch this anime, it is quite painful to see a good manga being destroyed in a miserable way, I still expect a remake with +70 episodes in other future, this anime sins at everything that an anime shounen needs, is a story full of script holes and very few characters, this anime is an INSULT to the manga and the fans themselves.Just read Karakuri Circus, dont watch. super important details soon after, the introduction of Narumi about his illness is forgotten and turned into a joke, the fear of Masaru being a person alone (including important point of the manga later), the fail worldbuilding of the karakuri mansion, and a ridiculous ending of the first arc, seriously that they traded a huge, sharp stone for lumps of wood?THIS DONT MAKE THE LESS SENSE, even more as Masaru survives a fire.The next arc is cruelly perforated and summed up in an idiotic way, nakamichi circus has a poor characterization in this anime, empty characters, conflicts removed, and all of them influence who masaru becomes in the future, Liese had a 1-volume bow itself, here it does not exist, it simply becomes a bad character.

It wasn't some God-tier kind of thing, but the concept was more or less unique and the plot was kind of a roller-coaster. That said, it's major flaws was just adding way too much extra stuff. Even for the crazy plot that this has, I'm pretty sure all of the characters had some tragic backstory for some reason and then it was roped in to the story in a way that felt like they did it just because. Not everyone has to have a dead family member or life-threatening disease to be an interesting character, sure some...can but not when the entire cast has one or more of those.Overall I enjoyed the show, it may not be my favorite but it was interesting to see characters get developed in some way that made them more than just a bad guy or a good guy.

Even though the series started balls-deep in action, which persists up until the 14th episode, it started, gradually, building the protagonists and antagonists up (even some deuteragonists were included).The series meticulously started filling in their personal histories (some of which were dating 2 centuries back), their current motivations, the intentions behind their actions (at both the situational and the broader level). and their thought processes....Furthermore, the emergence of tensions among the protagonists, and among the antagonists, was commonplace in the series, frequently leading to strained relationships among the former, while causing some of the later to switch sides. In general, most of the characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, were developing up until the final episode because situationally unique constellations of circumstances were forcing them to do so.◧ Concept: a conceptually unique series, revolving around a centuries-long feud between automata (self-governing puppets) and shirogane (humans; either mechanically enhanced or trained puppeteers) that was the indirect result of an instance of unrequited love.◧ Soundtrack: throughout the series, various pieces of music (classical, new age, Japanese folk music, J-pop) were used that were neither overly titillating nor disablingly uninteresting. I enjoyed them for the most part, though they could have been more captivating.◧ Animation: incredibly satisfying, based on highly saturated/highly vibrant colors. The characters' designs were distinctly clear from one another, the designs of puppets and automata were very elaborate and individualized, while the man-made structures and the landscapes were not too shabby either.◧ Plot: structurally, the series was very alluring due to its very volatile, unpredictable plotline that was usually flirting with 2-3 subplots at any given time. It's a very rare spectacle, in my view, that a shounen series gets to achieve this level of mysteriousness and maintain it for so long. Specifically, it took the series 20 episodes to reveal to the audience the actual antagonist, while his/her own motivations, intentions, and thought processes took a little longer to be depicted adequately.✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Plot: enjoyment-wise, the series's unfolding felt formulaic even though it was unusually sophisticated for an action shounen. It tended to rely more on intricate, drawn-out dramatic sequences, which were usually based on flashbacks from different perspectives, than on the characters' violent, but necessary, struggles in order for them to achieve their respective goals.◧ Action scenes: they tended to escalate and finish up quickly, instead of relying more on the use of slow-motion sequences, which are very well-established in, and absolutely expected of, the shounen genre.

Highly recommend this anime and this is my first review so.."", ""Karakuri Circus adapts a long-running shonen fighting manga. Most adaptations of this type usually drag out their material, either stalling with filler as it threatens to catch up to the source material, or adapting a very small portion of it for an episode. But a decently paced adaptation usually runs at about the same chapter to episode ratio across the board.One Piece, My Hero Academia and Hunter X Hunter(2011) all cover their first 100-120ish chapters within the first 58-63 episodes. Stardust Crusaders is a little snappier, covering 148 chapters in 52 episodes, but it also did the least filler of all of these. I...think most would agree these are pretty good adaptations of their source material - even if One Piece can be painfully slow these days, that wasn't a problem when it started.Karakuri Circus, by comparison, covers the plot of a whopping 180 chapters in the span of just 12 episodes. And because it skips most of that material, we go from revelation to revelation, from retcon to retcon, from dramatic character death to dramatic character death. Some characters have their introduction, redeeming moment and death in the span of 30 minutes.Some of this cutting is merciful. The manga wasn't exactly fast paced, and would get lost for many chapters with characters fighting throwaway opponents and delving deep into flashbacks. It's hard to say everything that's not here deserves your time.However, it was already a story that seemed like it got made up along the way. It has similarities to Kingdom Hearts style storytelling, featuring multiple versions and incarnations of the same characters, memory loss, outrageous melodrama, personality transfers, and many flashbacks revealing contrived connections and origins of those characters. One character in this story has at least five body doubles, incarnations, or family members with the exact same design and most of the personality in common. Karakuri Circus feels more like a mess the more you consume of it, and removing bits of the content from all over the place only makes this tale more nonsensical.Ushio & Tora is another manga from the same author that went through the same adaptation process, with the same company, and even some of the same voice actors, including the lead. It also features many of the same elements, down to the deep-dives into flashbacks revealing contrived connections and incarnations. For whatever reason though, maybe some smarter cuts, I enjoyed Ushio & Tora a whole lot more.I think that series benefitted from a strong bond between its dual protagonists and an easy to grasp set-up. Demon and demon hunter try to get along while fighting other demons or demon hunters that are out to get them. Got it. Easy. Even when things get a little nutty or happen without much justification, that core can keep you engaged.Narumi and Masaru sort of share this role in Karakuri, and aren't unlikeable characters. Narumi has a strong heroic everyman quality to him in the face of the monstrous dolls, and Masaru might be a bit of a crybaby but also displays a lot of growth. However, they aren't given the opportunity to be a dynamic duo for most of the show, leaving me with little to hold on to as the story moves at mach speed around them.If you want to see some 90s hotblooded shonen action where everyone makes crazy faces and yells a lot, just watch Ushio & Tora instead. It's made by the same people and it's similar in almost every way, but it's also better in almost every way. Unless you have an intense dislike of fantasy monsters and a strong affection for clowns and creepy dolls, I think you're way more likely to enjoy your time with that anime than Karakuri Circus - which just frustrated me more and more as it went on, until I gave up. think most would agree these are pretty good adaptations of their source material - even if One Piece can be painfully slow these days, that wasn't a problem when it started.Karakuri Circus, by comparison, covers the plot of a whopping 180 chapters in the span of just 12 episodes.

Although there were pacing issues throughout the story, the characters and ultimate ending make up for it. I heard from other reviewers that this story line was really rushed, and I do agree with them. A story of this magnitude could’ve been extended to 60 episodes instead of compressed into 36. However, I truly loved the experience of...the show. Seeing the development of Narumi, Masaru, and Shirogane as the story went on was really satisfying. But, yeah, the pacing issues still felt like an issue for me. If you’re looking for an action anime with the addition of puppets and hate spanning generations, give this show a watch! I’ll still recommend it regardless. the show. Seeing the development of Narumi, Masaru, and Shirogane as the story went on was really satisfying.

Well, I didn't take it seriously. And it was a slap ! I really enjoyed this show. The plot twist, the evolution of every characters, the first and second opening, everything was fabulous. A lot of various emotions in sight.I recommend this show to everyone who loves complicated plot. It may be confusing sometimes, but it's not a nonsense.Just a bad point : it's kinda sad that the anime is this short (compared to the manga).

That's roughly 8 months and eight months is a long time. If there's one thing this series does poorly, it's consistency. Sometimes the series really picks up and you can't wait to watch the next episode, other times watching paint dry would be more exciting.Story - 7This is a really long series so I won't go into much detail about the story as it isn't worth my time to write a summary as there would be too much details and things that would need to be discussed to...fully explain the story. Instead I'll just write my two cents of things I thought while watching the series, from beginning to end.The story starts out really boring. You wouldn't expect the story that would unfold if you didn't know anything about the source. On top of an subpar looking animation I would guess most people would immediately drop this after watching the first episode. For me, the story doesn't pick up or become interesting in the slightest until about 10 episodes in and that's a lot of episodes to watch.Afterwards the story gets really interesting but it has a lot of fights and battles between characters which aren't really that important to the story so if you're not a fan of those then you'll probably still find the show boring. A lot of people consider them filler but they're not exactly filler since there's at least some story as to why they're fighting. This goes on and continues repeatitively basically until the final episodes of the show.Art - 5The art is probably what drives most people away from the show. It isn't terrible but you can't exactly say it's unique or stands out from other series. As well as some scenes using 3D CGI, some people will stay away solely for that reason.Sound - 6The sound isn't bad but gets kind of repeatitive when the soundtrack doesn't change much throughout the 36 episodes. Other than that it's actually quite fitting for a show called karakuri circus, it has a circus-like vibe to it if there is such a thing.Character - 6If there's one character that really stands out, it's Masaru. Here's one character I never expected to like at all. He starts out as a really wimpy kid, almost annoying even and by the end of the series suddenly he turns out to be just the best character in the show. But I guess it's natural since he is kind of the main character, I'm just impressed how much character development he got throughout the show.Other characters are also in their own way interesting, especially Faceless, but I won't go into too much detail about them since I feel it would be spoiling too much.Enjoyment - 7I really enjoyed the series but even I have to admit that the animation and sound isn't really great of quality. The story is probably its best aspect but just having a good story isn't always enough to make an enjoyable show.Overall - 6Definitely better than I originally thought of how it was going to turn out.

The story did pull me in but then it just got... messy towards episode 14. Though, it is unique because it is about a circus and it has its whole storyline plotted out and, even with the characters. Though, with the characters, everything felt rushed and squishy. By the time that some parts just didn\'t make sense anymore to follow along with, I have put on-hold the show at episode 16. Perhaps I am missing out but with this time, perhaps reading the manga will do some better good about how the story is with Karakuri Circus....Art [6/10]: The art feels a bit old-school or a bit CGI but then again, it is a feeling that as if I just stumbled upon a Naruto, or Bleach, or even Zatch Bell --- a type of show. What I mean by that is that when first watching those shows, getting the excitement that the show can be one-of-its-own-kind for which I find in Karakuri Circus. Throughout some parts though, it did bother me that there were some mishaps that I actually did catch of the frames glitching out or not being complete. Especially in the fight scenes. Don\'t really know how to describe it but with that, that was one of the art issues that bothered me. Especially with blood scenes or type of stuff like that. It was weak but overall, story saves it.Sound [6/10]: Aha, its laughable that sometimes the mouth movements do not match the voice. The opening and ending songs though were really nice. But then again, speaking about sound, eh. I did not have any such issues with what I listened to. Track was ok.Character [6/10]: Ah, this was very messy. Perhaps better in the manga. Like I said, a squishy congested bunch of characters. You wonder why the creators would do such a thing to them. They tried in telling every character\'s backstory that it got kind of annoying and to the point that it was just rushed. It could have gone better, honestly. The characters are lovable though. So loveable that I cry because it is frustrating to watch their development. Perhaps its just part of life to watch characters go through pain, huh. And to add, I think there was a lot of characters to really catch up with. They literally take up one whole episode. But I guess that is what it is in making a manga to Anime and scrunching it up.Enjoyment [8/10]: This show deserves to be watched or at least trialed. It is just that I cannot continue in this year to watch it any further. I shall return to completing it soon after I heal. I think it comes to 36 episodes in total, but I feel like there\'s more? To see the finale of the character and stories ending, that is a goal. I will always remember this show as, ""The circus and aqua vitae, where martial arts and puppetry play a huge role.""Overall [7/10]: Even though it is just a 7 and not a 10, I would still put this show in my favorites list and recommend it.

It has a great story with development to it and the characters which keeps you interested and is very deserving of the 36 episodes it has. The circus theme seemed a bit weird at first but actually played into it really well and gave it's own quality to the action done in the show. It's one of those few which have made it into the top 5 of the hundreds of anime that I've watched so I'd definitely pick it up to watch if you haven't yet. "", 'Story(5/10)- The story in Karakuri circus is unique because it involves puppets which are life-size, can speak for their own and each has their own way of battling each other, displaying a variety of emotions.The story development in the first 3 episodes os great but then it takes a down-fall as many episodes only involve going back in past than present.Characters(5/10)- 1. Masaru, is a so called main character of the story which remains in focus for a very short and unsatisfying period of time whereas the side characters are burned out to  make them seem 3-d and full of life but it fails...real hard.Fairly, the character\'s are highly flawed. The development from weak to strong MC like in Deku or Bakugo in Boku no hero/My hero Academica, you will be disappointed to find that nothing of that sort is here.We go from one place to another without knowing fully about how they developed their skills or how they do it.How the weak can use their skills in such a way so that they could overwhelm the strong2. Narumi and rest of all cast-A.  Narumi  , once again a so-called main character is a superman who  would wait for a few hours or so, prancing around and after such a long time, he would suddenly go monkey and break part the bars of the cage or the metal puppets.Basically, it is a trope where the character would show his powers many many time and all the story we would have to watch how he is being saved and how he has the near-death injuries once more.EXAMPLE- He had more than 10 holes drilled through his body yet he was still kept alive, whereas even a vitality of a superhuman would degrade if he has injuries to this point.B. Shirogane - The puppeteer who is present to protect Masaru is probably the most full and complete character in this series.If you see this series, you would like her story and empathize with her in the 3\\4th part of the story but would also slowly grow bore of her.She is gentle, kind , has a strict and devastating past, has a sad back-story tracing up-to her eighteen generation of ancestors.The part about growing bore is similar to having ALL-MIGHT show his power in season 1 and having him get kidnapped in season-2 and season-3.The most irritating part is that in the last 5-9 episodes, she completely or partially forgets about his love for Masaru and only sees Narumi as her love whereas in the starting episodes, she is shown blushing heavily when Masaru told her that he really really likes her.THE IRONY IS THAT BOTH PEOLE LOVE HER AND SHE HAS A JOB TO PROTCT HIM BUT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE MEMORY LOSS ABOUT IT IN THE LAST EPISODES WHICH LEAVES ME WITH A GREAT DEAL OF HEADACHE.OVERALL- The attraction point for this anime are the puppets only and the OPENING AND ENDING SONG\'S.Yes, the op and ed are awesome just like the puppet\'s but not the puppeteers who operate them.1.The weak to strong trope here is highly flawed and like inly half-cooked, leaving you bored.2.You would feel cheated at the end of the story when you see shirogane with Narumi as you would definitely like her with Masaru.Also, the puppets fight are monologue and not interesting or exotic.3.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE ANIME-WHY HAD JIN DONE WRONG THAT HE DID NOT DESERVED SHIROGANE OR FRANCIENE . AND WHAT HIS BROTHER HAS DONE THAT SHE LOVED HIM. ALSO, WHEN JIN TOLD HIS BROTHER THAT HE LOVE\'S THE LADY, YIN( THE BROTHER) GOES AND SAY\'S I LOVE YOU TO FRANCIENE WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE YOU WULD NOT DO THAT IF YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.4.

The story line can be a bit confusing at times, and there was one point that it felt like a lot of random things were being thrown in out of nowhere in the middle of the show. It almost was like throwing in a brand new plot right in the middle of the series, which was somewhat confusing. But it's smoothed out in the end and is othewise a very good anime. It was very sad and just really makes you think about humanitiy...and life and stuff like that. The puppets were fascinating, and a really well done part in the show. I cried a lot, there is a lot of sad parts in this show. This show also had very few problems with modesty, swearing, or graphic violence. There was very little graphics, though the show can get pretty violent. There are few immodest dresses, but I have very little to complain about.

A lot of the plot points feel like it came out of nowhere, and that makes the show feel contrived at multiple instances. To that end, I would recommend reading the manga. In many regards, this is one of those series that the manga covers a few of the anime's faults. However, for the life of me, I cannot give the series anything lower than a 9 regardless if we are talking about the manga, or the anime. The anime sports a unique ost and art...style to fit the uncanny and even uneasy nature of the story's premise. I adore this show for its unique premise and just how dark it can get at times. I found enjoyment in most of the cast as well with a minority of them being rather hit or miss. However, it's not without its own flaws. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the huge amount of time the story spends in flashbacks, and the mechanics of Aqua Vita (a sort of super drug in the story that cures any illness) makes sorting who is who a dizzying chore. I'd understand if you'd need a flow chart to keep them all straight. One other problem that's unique to the anime is that for some of the puppet fights, CGI sometimes rears it's ugly head and it's a bit jarring to see it there. Luckily, it's used pretty sparingly. But when there is full 2-D animation in the fights, it varies between acceptable and well done. To conclude, I love this show for it's unique premise about puppets. It helps create an uncanny atmosphere that makes it easy to go from lighthearted sections to darker sections. The animation and ost only serve to make that uncanny atmosphere all the more present. And most of the characters are enjoyable with a few blemishes here and there. Its faults for me mainly come from the occasional CGI, how contrived the anime can come off as at times, the amount of time spent in flashbacks (which the flashbacks themselves aren't bad, you just spend a long time in them as opposed to being in the present storyline), and just how confusing it can be to keep some of the characters straight with the mechanics of Aqua Vita. I want to give it a 10 personally, but the objective flaws in the anime force me to detract a few points. I will never say though that this is a bad show or that it is not one of my personal favorite stories because this was something that I personally really enjoyed despite its objective flaws. style to fit the uncanny and even uneasy nature of the story's premise.

Sure, a lot of the manga content could have been cut and condensed, but not to the extent the anime attempted to do. Actions made by one character are given to another, and as such their characterisations are changed. Some of the stuff that was skipped was essential to the story. Some things are never explained.For instance, why do they never mentioned that the Midnight Circus and the automatas not only spread a deadly disease, but they survive by feeding on the blood of humans and that is why they leave such a destruction on their path? Most of the shirogane have a direct beef with the automatas and that is why they\'re so determined to fight them, as victims of the disease who lost their towns and families through the attacks. This is only explored briefly in the form of a few characters telling their sad backstory before dying, whereas this fact is pervasive in the manga.Some of the characters have longer arcs in the manga where you come to care for them, for instance Narumi travels with Lucille and Guy for a long while and their relationship is much more lighthearted in the manga. When Narumi snaps and takes the role of the ""demon"" they worry for him and try to mentor him. Lucille has such a beautiful and tragic story, she lives with the guilt of what she has done to her daughter so she finds a replacement daughter of sort in Ming-xia and it\'s quite poignant for both of them, in the anime this is rushed to the point that they share this emotional moment and you wonder where did it even come from.Some of the story were done justice, Francine and Angelina\'s for instance. The 3 protagonists all have good arcs. The ending was an absolute mess, but this was true for the manga as well so I can\'t really fault the anime for that. Overall though they missed the mark on most of the themes explored in the manga.I don\'t think the manga was perfect, but it has original ideas and it\'s quite beautiful and moving in many parts. The anime rushed and compressed the story way too much so it was unsatisfying overall, hopefully one day they can make a proper adaptation.

The anime rushed and compressed the story way too much so it was unsatisfying overall, hopefully one day they can make a proper adaptation.', 'im doing a simple and spoiler free reviewstory:the plot is actually amazing, deep unpredictable twists, and the world building is awesome (9)art:it is not good, moreover some battles r awkwardly animated making it worse (4)sound:...no memorable soundtracks, bgm sometimes weirdly used in peculiar situations (5)character:interesting characters, i like almost all of them, backstories r also interesting (8)enjoyment:pacing is weird and too fast sometimes, many anticlimatic moments, waste of good story (2)overall9+4+5+8+2 / 5 = 5.6probably just read the manga i guess though i havent read it, the anime is overall a mess, many awkward moments, and waste of potential no memorable soundtracks, bgm sometimes weirdly used in peculiar situations (5)character:interesting characters, i like almost all of them, backstories r also interesting (8)enjoyment:pacing is weird and too fast sometimes, many anticlimatic moments, waste of good story (2)overall9+4+5+8+2 / 5 = 5.6probably just read the manga i guess though i havent read it, the anime is overall a mess, many awkward moments, and waste of potential']"

The characters and art are the same, so you can just enjoy it like any other episodeIn no way does this OVA make the characters look like ""clowns"", they are not put in overly Dangerous situations so the OVA just shows their comedy gimmick as we already know them, they are funny as they are.Nothing outstanding, just another good episode of Kekkai...Sensen Sensen', 'We have few short stories here centering around our main leads.In the first, Zapp gets assaulted and then publicly shamed by his love interested who further summons and army of weirdos to kill him.

The pinnacle of this story being cenzored, pixelated middle fingers, shown by the evil women, of course.

Kyoukai no Rinne 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31610/Kyoukai_no_Rinne_2nd_Season,"[""When it comes to a second season of any given show, the general thought behind it is to give the viewers more of what the shows that they like and provide more adapted material.  Depending on the show, it can either further push the gripping story that people want to see the conclusion of, or just...do whatever the first season did in the first place.  Continuing the latter trend is Kyoukai no Rinne, the second season that really doesn't have much actual value.Story: Picking off from Season 1, season 2 is virtually the exact same story concept involving a half shinigami boy who...survives off of literal pocket change and his seer female classmate dealing with various events and happenings involving the real world and the afterlife.Rinne's story is as basic as stories can go.  The entire 25 episode runtime is more or less a mix of episodic running gags that involve classic story writing like misunderstandings, getting in peoples' way to stop them from doing what you don't like, and the classic Rinne standard of poking fun at one high school boy's poverty and how hilarious the concept of not knowing when you'll get your next meal is.  Really though, that's about all I can say.You get introduced to new members of the cast who dip in and out of the series's importance, but as far as new content goes, that's about all you'll see.  The runtime consists of introductory arcs where our protagonists deal with said new member of the cast, spirit episodes where they deal with some troublesome spirit, or poking fun at Rinne episodes where they...poke fun at the poor boy.  Stagnant is about the only thing to describe this series since each episode is more or less the same thing over and over again without any real  meaningful progression as the series acts more like a gag manga than anything with a cohesive plot.Truly, average is about the only thing that can describe the story of Kyoukai no Rinne.  There doesn't really feel like there's any form of progression, and the story goes back to the status quo to the point that actual progression doesn't exist in the series at all.Overview:+/-  Pretty much the same thing as you got in Season 1Characters:  Characters are the same as what you see in season 1 with a few minor changes to the recurring cast involving its new members.In terms of our main cast of Rinne and Sakura, these two don't change much at all.  Rinne's still the somewhat competent type in severe poverty (because the world loves to rub it in) and Sakura is still the mostly emotionless doll that just casually notes and accepts every little thing that happens around her.  The romantic subplot between the two as noted by what exists in the first season does get some progress, but it's so minuscule that it might as well be at a snail's pace.As far as new members go, we have Renge and Matsugo, as well as the two kuroneko contractors of Kain and Ageha, Oboro and Suzu respectively.  Like the other members of the recurring cast, they don't really change much in the grand scheme of things.  Their characters are basic with zero development, and as such, don't have much in the way of qualities that're worth noting.  What I do find odd is the fact that the earlier more important recurring cast members of Ageha and Tsubasa aren't actually all that important.  They appear so little that their existences are almost wiped clean by these new characters and it feels strange knowing that previously important characters are now no longer important.Overview:+/- Largely one-note cast.  (Good for gag series, which this probably is, but not really a good thing for story writing.)Art:  Brain's Base's animation for this series is average at best.  It looks nice, the colors are good, but the overall animation and quality screams mediocre.  It's not that it's bad, but it doesn't have that kind of art appeal that other anime are able to make.Sound:  Sound's probably the most forgettable.  All of the tracks are ordinary and/or generic and have on more than one been skipped because I just do not care for them.Personal Enjoyment:  Kyoukai no Rinne is a strange creature.  It's a gag-related series focusing on going back to the status quo whenever the episode is finished and relies heavily on its semi-wacky nature and poor protagonist on creating any semblance of comedy which while does get tiring, isn't so bad that it's worth less than a shrug.  As such, I find it very hard to call this show anything aside from 'mediocre.'  It doesn't deserve any medals, but it doesn't deserve much or any hate because it meanders at its own pace, so it ends up finding this crossroad for me where I neither hate nor like it, which is an odd feeling.Did I enjoy this anime?Eh.  I've seen worse.  I've also seen better, so my opinion on this series is pretty gray at best.What didn't I like about this anime?I'm a firm believer that jokes should not be overused.  Personally, I wasn't a fan of how often the series spent on making fun of Rinne and making even the writing stomp on him to the point that he's crying tears of blood in sadness.  Finding a protagonist in an unlucky situation is fine since everyone does that, but when you get nothing but loaded dice that rolls E luck, you know you're probably going a little too far.Would I recommend this series?If you saw Season 1 and liked it, than you should probably watch this for more entertainment.

"", ""One of the more interesting animes that I've seen. I know summoning giant robots isn't anything new *cough* Gundam *cough* but given the settings, it is really separates itself from the other animes.

"", ""Made in the same vein as another Sunrise mecha show, Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru, Madou King Granzort is a child-friendly show about chibi characters fighting in super robots on the moon to save the world. The plot of each episode tends to fall into a monster of the week format, where the protagonists explore a new part of the moon, encounter a villain, and defeat it; however, this structure is abandoned in the later episodes as the plot gets concluded, as is typical for children's shows of this nature.There are plenty of light-hearted, comedic moments, but they manage not to be mind-numbingly dumb. Additionally, since...this show is aimed at young children, the humour is not ecchi, which is a plus. The characters are the typical optimistic, happy-go-lucky shonen protagonists and evil, snarly villains who must be defeated to save the world.What this show stands out in is the visuals and worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is rich and detailed, as the pre-attack segments of each show focus on exploring the goofy, strange world. The animation is quite excellent, with the bright, vibrant colours and crisp cel-animated aesthetics typical in better-animated 80s/90s anime. There are plenty of reused transformation and attack sequences, but the animation in these sequences -- especially the transformation sequences -- is very smooth and colourful, so seeing these beautiful sequences multiple times isn't necessarily a bad thing. The world is a magical fantasy world with a few modern or sci-fi elements thrown in, such as mechs and vehicles, which makes the world feel very similar to Dragon Ball. The similarities to Dragon Ball are furthered in the villains wearing uniforms very similar to those of the Ginyu Force, which I found neat, as well as an attack that involves throwing an energy ball, much like in the Kamehameha. The similarities to other anime continue in that the mechs are giant heads that transform into mechs, much like in Gurren Lagann. Additionally, the interiors of the enemy mechs are reminiscent of the interiors of the Gunmen, and the exteriors of the enemy mechs are similar to the first enemy mechs encountered in Gurren Lagann. Since Granzort seems to be quite popular in Asia, despite having flown under the radar of Western audiences, I wonder how much inspiration Gurren Lagann took from Granzort!Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. I loved the animation, the comedy, the fusion of mechs and fantasy, and the exploration of the world the most. I was rarely bored watching this anime and found it very interesting. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys childish anime, retro anime, or mecha anime. It is wholesome and has has cool fights/mechs and wonderful animation. this show is aimed at young children, the humour is not ecchi, which is a plus.

Mahou Senshi Louie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1164/Mahou_Senshi_Louie,"[""I would rate this a 7.5 if I could.  It has a message, it has entertainment value, and it isn't as ecchi as one might think from a casual glance.The female characters are surprisingly deep and I found that I knew real-life women who could be compared to each of them.  On the one hand, one can watch this show as merely being a bit of fan service, counterbalanced by a male buffoon, thus making a compromise show suitable for viewing in mixed male-female company.  I take the show more seriously;  I think the writers are making a point about how...an old-fashioned masculine man can get along with aggressive, independent female co-workers who are *not* romantically attracted to him in the slightest.  I think it's trying to make a point about modern gender roles.  I could be reading way too much into it.At the same time, it's very intertextual, which is a fancy way of saying it rips off cliches from all kinds of sources that have come before it.  IMHO the writers do a great job of ripping off a diverse selection of sources -- not just swords-and-sorcery, but also murder mysteries, martial arts stories, etc. an old-fashioned masculine man can get along with aggressive, independent female co-workers who are *not* romantically attracted to him in the slightest.

There were quite a few times I laughed out loud while watching this. The series is 24 episodes long, and it felt like an appropriate length. There weren't really any dry episodes or filler that was noticeable either. The last three episodes were more or less dedicated to the ending, and although there were events leading up to this it almost felt like an abrupt twist to finish things...up, but in the end I was pleased with the way things were handled so I can't complain.

If you dig comedic anime and the old school RPG setting then I'd highly recommend this."", 'I\'ll admit, Rune Soldier has a very special place in my heart, and I\'m definitely biased towards it. I hope this review will explain why.Story-wise, Rune Soldier follows somewhat standard form. A group of female adventurers (Melissa the priestess, Genie the fighter, and Merril the theif) need a Mage to fill out their party so they can properly explore ruins and do all that fun adventuring stuff. The problem is, the only Mage willing to join their party this side of anywhere is Louie, a blue-haired, barrel-chested smart-mouth who prefers fighting hand-to-hand than casting spells (mostly because he\'s pretty terrible at magic). Unfortunately, Melissa\'s deity...informs her that Louie is to be her Champion, and thus the group is saddled with him regardless.The world of Rune Soldier is vibrant, diverse, and infinitely interesting, and the characters frequently travel to new places in search of fame and fortune, while frequently returning to the capital city (which is also just as interesting and engaging as the rest of the world). Half the show is spent on their \'down-time\' as well as the adventuring, so you get to learn a lot about the characters by what they do when they\'re not climbing wizard\'s towers to stop rogue elementals from destroying the country.There are a couple of interesting sub-plots and recurring characters, mainly an elven girl who helps out occasionally, a rival adventuring party, and eventually the endgame plot, as Louie uncovers a sinister plan to take over the kingdom. The only penalties I can give the plot are than some of the episodes are less engaging than others, but I wouldn\'t want to cut any of them out - they all add to the characterization. 9/10, definitely.Art style is pretty typical of the time it was made, it\'ll feel very similar to Slayers, but with a more mature and rough feel to it. It\'s good, but not spectacular. Some of the magical effects look a little dated in their presentation, but thankfully no epilepsy warning needed. 7/10.Sound design is good for the show, but while it fit the scenes quite well, none of them were particularly memorable. They served their purpose, and would work great if you run a table-top fantasy RPG game. 7/10.Character - oh, here we get to the good part. You see, the best thing about Rune Soldier is the character growth, and how the relationships change over time. Louie is initially relegated to being a pack mule for the group, nothing more than a waste of space that\'s only good for carrying things and the occasional spell (if that). His irresponsible nature and gung-ho attitude in the first few episodes only serve to reinforce their view of him in this way. However, as the show progresses, Louie improves in many ways - swordsmanship, playing nice with teammates, even magical prowess, and most importantly he gains their respect. By the end of the show, they\'re fighting right alongside him, trusting him enough to let him take the lead for once, and letting his infection enthusiasm get to them. It\'s a beautiful thing, and you can track the incremental progression from episode to episode.The best part is, IT\'S NOT A HAREM. Rune Soldier has the balls to put a male lead in a group of female characters and NOT have them falling for him at every turn. It\'s fundamentally about respect and trust, and it\'s a breath of fresh air. The only character that has even the slightest hint of interest in Louie in a romantic way is Melissa, and that\'s really more of a ""Wow, he\'s actually a really nice guy. Why haven\'t I seen this before?"" kind of moment. Overall, it\'s just a superb cast of characters accompanied by excellent writing, and it\'s one of the main draws of the show. 10/10.Enjoyment is a huge part of any anime, and Rune Soldier does NOT fall behind. There are a lot of different episodes (since the show tends to follow an episodic rather than serialized stye), and there\'s something here for everyone. Dashing swordfights, tournament battles, magic duels, sea monsters, slice of life stories, festivals and fairs, exploring dark forests and holding armies at bay, there are tons of fun adventures to be had here. The show starts strong and keeps the momentum up from the very beginning. The only mar on the enjoyment depends on what method you decide to watch it. Subbed is okay, but the voice actors always felt a little off. The English dub is actually surprisingly good, with the exception of Merril, who is a little annoying and high-pitched. 9/10.Overall, this show is AMAZING. The lackluster art and sound is only due to its age - in everything that matters, this show is top notch. Get your popcorn ready, get comfortable, and watch the first 4 episodes. You\'ll get hooked in no time, and the only thing you\'ll regret is that it\'s finished. 910, and a definite recommendation here, for what it\'s worth. informs her that Louie is to be her Champion, and thus the group is saddled with him regardless.The world of Rune Soldier is vibrant, diverse, and infinitely interesting, and the characters frequently travel to new places in search of fame and fortune, while frequently returning to the capital city (which is also just as interesting and engaging as the rest of the world). Half the show is spent on their \'down-time\' as well as the adventuring, so you get to learn a lot about the characters by what they do when they\'re not climbing wizard\'s towers to stop rogue elementals from destroying the country.There are a couple of interesting sub-plots and recurring characters, mainly an elven girl who helps out occasionally, a rival adventuring party, and eventually the endgame plot, as Louie uncovers a sinister plan to take over the kingdom. The only penalties I can give the plot are than some of the episodes are less engaging than others, but I wouldn\'t want to cut any of them out - they all add to the characterization. 9/10, definitely.Art style is pretty typical of the time it was made, it\'ll feel very similar to Slayers, but with a more mature and rough feel to it. It\'s good, but not spectacular. Some of the magical effects look a little dated in their presentation, but thankfully no epilepsy warning needed. 7/10.Sound design is good for the show, but while it fit the scenes quite well, none of them were particularly memorable. They served their purpose, and would work great if you run a table-top fantasy RPG game. 7/10.Character - oh, here we get to the good part. You see, the best thing about Rune Soldier is the character growth, and how the relationships change over time. Louie is initially relegated to being a pack mule for the group, nothing more than a waste of space that\'s only good for carrying things and the occasional spell (if that). His irresponsible nature and gung-ho attitude in the first few episodes only serve to reinforce their view of him in this way. However, as the show progresses, Louie improves in many ways - swordsmanship, playing nice with teammates, even magical prowess, and most importantly he gains their respect. By the end of the show, they\'re fighting right alongside him, trusting him enough to let him take the lead for once, and letting his infection enthusiasm get to them. It\'s a beautiful thing, and you can track the incremental progression from episode to episode.The best part is, IT\'S NOT A HAREM. Rune Soldier has the balls to put a male lead in a group of female characters and NOT have them falling for him at every turn. It\'s fundamentally about respect and trust, and it\'s a breath of fresh air. The only character that has even the slightest hint of interest in Louie in a romantic way is Melissa, and that\'s really more of a ""Wow, he\'s actually a really nice guy. Why haven\'t I seen this before?"" kind of moment. Overall, it\'s just a superb cast of characters accompanied by excellent writing, and it\'s one of the main draws of the show. 10/10.Enjoyment is a huge part of any anime, and Rune Soldier does NOT fall behind. There are a lot of different episodes (since the show tends to follow an episodic rather than serialized stye), and there\'s something here for everyone. Dashing swordfights, tournament battles, magic duels, sea monsters, slice of life stories, festivals and fairs, exploring dark forests and holding armies at bay, there are tons of fun adventures to be had here. The show starts strong and keeps the momentum up from the very beginning. The only mar on the enjoyment depends on what method you decide to watch it. Subbed is okay, but the voice actors always felt a little off. The English dub is actually surprisingly good, with the exception of Merril, who is a little annoying and high-pitched. 9/10.Overall, this show is AMAZING. The lackluster art and sound is only due to its age - in everything that matters, this show is top notch. Get your popcorn ready, get comfortable, and watch the first 4 episodes. You\'ll get hooked in no time, and the only thing you\'ll regret is that it\'s finished. 910, and a definite recommendation here, for what it\'s worth.', ""I thought the first half of the series was quite enjoyable. In the tradition of &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot; etc, it's the story of a guy who's strong on heart but weak on execution. The twist of having the standard adventure types of warrior, thief and holyperson portrayed by competent women works well and the series never descends into a harem comedy although it hovers close every once in awhile. The situations are strong and the humor fast paced. Unfortunately after the about the 11th episode it falls apart rather quickly - like the creative team wanted to move on to other...things and just kinda wrote some stuff to fulfill the 24 episode obligation. The stories are pretty cliche - the humor is weak - it becomes disappointing. The first ten or so episodes are definitely worth watching though. things and just kinda wrote some stuff to fulfill the 24 episode obligation.

But when viewing, I felt that the author still wanted to make it better. Using a single template, he added / changed those elements that he considered missing. I think you often had the feeling that you want to change...something in the work so that you like it. And ""Mahou Senshi Louie"" is probably such an example.One of the interesting elements is the approach to the development of the main characters (this applies mainly to the main character - Louis.) - they are more good not in character, but in their ""image"", since it is built from many remarkable components. Simply put - the characters have a ""background"" - their past, a place in this world.

Moreover, they constantly repeat the same thing, which is already very annoying for the third time. Apparently the author wanted to create the impression of an anti-harem, but obviously overdid it.And the second drawback is the ill-fated grotesqueness. I know it\'s VERY weird to blame comedy for this. But the fact is that the series does not balance well between seriousness and complete absurdity.

Upon reading its background, I was surprised that it shares the same world and minds behind the abominably boring Record of Lodoss War. Why? Because unlike Record, Rune Soldier is actually entertaining, fun, and never got stale. While Record told a Dungeons and Dragons tale in utter humorless and super serious vibe, Rune Soldier is closer to what a DnD session feels like and after finishing it, I was pleasantly satisfied despite the ending not being that good by itself.Story:Rune Soldier is a slapstick, mostly episodic tale about a musclebound wizard named Louie and his companions trying their luck around the magical realm, getting into skirmishes with magical beings, scoundrels, or just dealing with the most mundane everyday problems. It does have a final arc that is kinda serious, but i was thankful it didn't bend so much as to betray the reason why I loved it. As a fantasy anime, the setting was fairly bland and the creatures are cardboard cutouts of pop culture. I also found the magic system barely there and quite unexplored, despite the main character being a magician. Somehow, this works because the show is a comedy and one of its running gag is that Louie uses his fists far more than his wand. Likewise, the show has characterization despite its episodic structure and one of the most lighthearted fantasy anime around. In my book, that is a plus amidst the hundreds isekais that are complicating things exponentially.Characters:This is where the show shines the best. The four-man band's dynamics was just fun to watch, with their banters and comradery bouncing in and out and evolving per episode. Louie rose up to be one of my favorite fantasy protagonists and his build as a Muscle Wizard is up there as one of the gag characters that players of Dungeons and Dragons would create in a bonkers campaign. He may be a dumbass but has hints of wisdom in terms of practicality and is not relegated to a generic do-gooder because his flaws just further enhance how different he is from the usual MC. Despite my like for Louie however, Merril was just my favorite the cast, a mouse-type rogue with an explosive, yet non-annoying personality and has the best synergy with the others. Genie, the boisterous female Guts is there, with good storyline but somehow plain characterization. The last of the four is the cleric Melissa who started generic however grew up the most by the end of the show and her catchphrase just grew up with me. Despite four of them mostly together, there is spirtually a fifth member in Louie's friend Ila who was just useful as she is one of the sexiest nerds ever. The support characters are likewise nice to have with despite their irrelevancy to the main plot, which doesn't really matter much because the main cast's dynamics was strong enough to carry the show to the end. It was so strong that when the show ended, I really missed them.Sound:Both the opening and ending evokes the Japanese pop and rock of the age and I just loved listening to them alongside the eyecatching animations while they play. Voice acting was marvelous, especially with Merril's voice which gave her such an enormous charm. The background ost was functional in general though I give props to the powerchord powerup theme which just plays whenever Louie does something heroic, something dumb as hell, or a mix of both. It is the narm, baby.Art:Artwise, it stands out personally because it is just 90s art which I absolutely love. The design of the girls just pop out, Louie is burly and striking, though i gotta say the animation does dip at times. That said, the animation was mostly fine and probably most of its budget was spent on the first episode and the last where the sakugas were scattered generously. When action kicks in though, there were nice shots. Being a relic of the past, its superdeform actually aged well and never went to extremes unlike its contemporaries. Ila and Merril just look fine as hell and are top tier babes in the anime world.Overall:In general, Rune Soldier never overstayed its welcome, the gags mostly stick, the humor works for a fan of slapstick like me, and a fine concoction of fantasy and comedy that is just timeless due to its 90s+2000s aesthetics. Its story is barebones but didn't matter really because this show is among the most lightest ones out there and the enjoyment comes from just seeing the fun adventures and character interactions that didn't fail to entertain me. For a Dungeons and Dragons fan who may feel dismayed by Record of Lodoss War, this is essentially the show with the 'real' spirit of the game. Rune Soldier is the mozzarella pizza that remains delicious hot or cold and is an absolute classic.

Mahou no Stage Fancy Lala,https://myanimelist.net/anime/604/Mahou_no_Stage_Fancy_Lala,"[""[SPOILER WARNING]First of all I must say that I'm not into maho-shoujo series, that's why Fancy Lala was a big discovery for me. It's oriented on mature themes and not some almighty little girls what's common in such type of animes. Fancy Lala is definitely among underrated shows. It's not a wonder if we take first, misleading episode into consideration. At first I thought about dropping it too, but fortunately I haven't.Story: The story envolves around girl called Miho.With help of magical dinosaurs she posseses power to transform into teenage beauty.  We see adult problems from 9-year-old girl's point of view. She is...able to carry out both Idol job and at the same time remain normal school girl. The story is a big development for Miho, we see her handling different situations. It's just irresistable not to love that excellent character. A weak girl grows into one of the strongest female lead.What I don't like about story is that we don't really get any explanations about those magical powers, how did those dinosaurs appear or disappear. However it doesn't really matter. Those dinosaurs serverd their purpose and that's the main thing.Characters: One of the strongest thing in Fancy Lala is the character development. Every one of them is flashed out very well and their problems never feel out of place or contrived. I mostly loved how they facialy expressed everything and not with some generic dialogues. Obviously Miho is the stand out. I was blown away with her behavior after Lala's disappearing by the end of the series. How a little girl feels guilty and apogoizes to the agency members. That moment was very well-done. It's the result of the whole build-up. Yea, Miho has grown up!Art/Ost: Great animation. It really helped out with expressing those emotions. Also the character design is simple and appealing. Transformation sequences look average as well. Same must be said about the ost, which is propitious to the subtle drama moments.This is my first anime review. That in itself is a testament to the degree to which I'm impressed by this series. Don't be fooled, as I was, by the rather mundane description. I've seen nothing else, anime or otherwise, so simultaneously fun, touching and slightly profound. I really enjoyed with it and especially the ending which was truly fair and original. able to carry out both Idol job and at the same time remain normal school girl.

Back in the 1990s, both American and Japanese kids shows tried to appeal to young boys, which...was the desired audience back then. But what about shows for girls? Nowadays, people think girls shows won\'t sell. Thankfully, with the new cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, that view is changing, but most channels often have shows about teen idols who go around doing stupid things while looking pretty and basically being popular and hip with an imaginary audience laughing in the background. Oddly enough, the show I\'m reviewing right now is an idol show, yet it is absolutely NOTHING like that I just described!To be honest, it is rather easy for people to overlook this little gem, and I can see why. I mean, with a title like Fancy Lala, how can you not think ""Ugh. It\'s gonna be a G3 My Little Pony-esque kids show about idols having endless tea parties, giggling over nothing, and basically acting like stuck-up brats""? Well, never fear, for this show is not like that at all! Though this show doesn\'t exactly have a premise that screams ""Watch me!!"" and you really have to watch the show in order to understand it\'s strengths. Fancy Lala is instead about a young, carefree girl named Miho who aspires to become a famous mangaka or model since her mother is a drama producer and her father is a paleontologist who studies dinosaur fossils. One day, after an unpleasant incident at a local store, she finds herself with two stuffed animals, which are actually little dinosaur fairies from another world. The two dinosaurs, Pigu and Mogu, give her a magical sketchbook and pen that not only allows her to bring her drawings to life, but to turn her into a 15-year-old version of herself, and upon transforming, she gets recruited by Lyrical Productions to become the next big thing! But is becoming a model/singer really worth it, especially considering all the trouble you get into to do it?Now, for those of you thinking this is going to be some kind of clone of Bratz or Hannah Montana or something like that, prepare to be proven wrong, because Fancy Lala is NOT that kind of show. Yes, it\'s a children\'s show. Yes, it\'s aimed at young girls. Yes, it has magical girl elements. Yes, it has cute little animal mascots. Yes, our lead character becomes a model/singer to meet up with a man she admires. But Fancy Lala is NOT a dragged out toy advertisement (heck, considering how the episodes play out, it\'s not even trying to promote any toys since none exist!), NOT a glorified idol show, NOT a teen-girl popular stuck-up brat fest, and, most importantly, NOT a show that\'s so cutesy and saccharine that you want to shoot yourself. Well, technically, yes, Fancy Lala DOES have some cutesy moments, but like I said, they\'re not overly sugary and sweet either. Not only that, this was made in 1998, BEFORE all of those dumb idol shows began flooding the market! Let me tell you: Fancy Lala is a polished gem in the anime world. No magical girl anime or shoujo anime I\'ve seen has even come CLOSE to holding a candle to Fancy Lala\'s awesomeness. No, it doesn\'t have action. No, it doesn\'t have an evil overlord trying to steal the joy of life and destroy the world for cliche reasons. Nobody said that all magical girl anime needed to be about saving the world! If anything, you can consider this another way to deconstruct a magical girl anime.Let me start with the animation. This anime was produced by Studio Pierrot, the guys behind Naruto and Bleach. Long ago, in 1983 to be exact, Studio Pierrot hit it big when they produced a magical girl anime just like Fancy Lala called Creamy Mami, only it was 52 episodes long instead of 26. Lots of people loved it, so much so that it prompted Pierrot into making more magical girl anime afterward! But it didn\'t last long. Fancy Lala is actually a remake of an OVA called Harbor Light Story: Fashion Lala, which I did watch (and I really need to finish my review of that). But Fancy Lala is, in my opinion, a HECK of a lot better. It\'s animation is, for it\'s time, surprisingly detailed. I\'d even be so bold as to say that the animation here is a heck of a lot better than even CardCaptor Sakura, which aired in the exact same year, and that\'s saying a lot! The show tries to make use of a lot of subtle drama by making the characters express their feelings through facial expressions instead of angsty dialogue and contrived coincidences or through cheese and melodrama, something that is a huge and oh-so-common pitfall in most shoujo anime nowadays. The character art in itself is very expressive and tries its best to convey even the smallest of emotions, whether it\'s through facial expressions or movement. Nothing important is said, but you don\'t need words to convey your emotions, and Fancy Lala does this great! Though I do admit, the transformation sequences are a bit generic, but hey! It does what it\'s supposed to do and nothing more.The music...oh, the music! The opening and ending songs are nice and catchy, since they\'re performed by Miho\'s voice actress, who was back then a fledgling actress/singer as well. Don\'t worry, they\'re not overly sweet and saccharine like most magical girl anime theme songs. But in my opinion, it\'s the soundtrack that really steals this anime for me. For those of you who don\'t know, the soundtrack was composed by Michiru Oshima, whom many of you know did the soundtracks for the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime, Nabari no Ou, Le Chevalier D\'Eon, X\'amd: Lost Memories, and So-Ra-No-Wo-To. She also did the osts for My Sister Momoko, The Glass Rabbit, and 5-tou ni Naritai. She is steadily becoming one of my favorite anime composers next to Yuki Kajiura and Two-Mix. She\'s known for her normally orchestral sounding music, but her best work is definitely here in Fancy Lala. Her pieces fit soooo well in every single scene, and they have her name written all over it! There\'s light-hearted music in the light-hearted scenes, and when there\'s a sad scene, the mellow but beautiful background music tugs at your heartstrings. Often times in anime, music isn\'t always thrown in the right places, but here, nothing is mismatched! The music matches the scenes, sets the mood, and creates a fitting atmosphere for each scene. I wish I could buy the OST somewhere!The characters are just wonderful. They\'re not carbon copies of typical stereotypes, they look, sound, and act like real people you often run into in real life, from the kids to the adults. Everybody has their own set of problems whether it\'s their job, their background, their decisions, their actions, etc. Nobody\'s perfect nor overly flawed in this show. That\'s what makes the characters so great. Nobody\'s problems are over exaggerated or overly complex. Miho herself is a great character. Despite the fact that she has a lot to deal with in the adult world with her newfound magic, she still manages to remain an innocent child despite being burdened with the task of carrying the weight of both being an idol and the whole series. We get to know her through and through, and it\'s because we get to know her so well that the theme of adult problems going on around her works extremely well. Her voice actress only makes it better. Children in this series really do sound like children instead of squeaky 30 year old actresses who try too hard to sound overly moe, and I have to admit, Taro\'s Japanese voice doesn\'t sit well with me. I think his English dub voice sounds much better.Now, this isn\'t the kind of show everyone will like, and I can understand that, but I want to explain why the show won me over. Instead of trying to do something big, Fancy Lala focuses so much more on small subjects, like the downsides of using magic and parting with things that have a lot of sentimental value, and IT WORKS SO WELL HERE. It works so well here that the above episodes regarding said subjects actually made me cry! Episode 8 especially! Just watch it and see for yourself how wonderful it is, and the message it conveys...holy shrimp, I don\'t think anything will top Fancy Lala\'s genuine and poignant way of showing us that magic isn\'t eternal. By focusing on something simple, the show saves the trouble of trying to do too much and blow up in the end, something a lot of modern anime tend to do, and, according to most anime fans, it happens about 85% of the time, and it\'s not pretty. Fancy Lala manages to accomplish so much even though it\'s such a simple story, and the ending, which happens to be the very best thing about Fancy Lala as a whole (why don\'t more magical girl or shoujo anime do this?!), is a result of that. And surprisingly enough, even though Fancy Lala looks innocent and sweet, it actually takes quite a lot of risks. Heck, I watched the entire anime subbed, and in episode 13 they mention the word sex! But it\'s only used once (ONLY once. Never again after that), and I don\'t think Miho heard it, so I can let it slide. I don\'t know if it\'s present in the dubbed version, but if it is, then I don\'t know if it\'ll sit well with other people.While it is a nice show, it does have some flaws. For one thing, we never get an explanation from where Pigu and Mogu come from. Miho just ran into them by pure coincidence. We never learn much about the Mystery Man or why he has access to magic in the first place, and admittedly, Miho does become talented at acting and singing a little too quickly, but I\'ve seen worse examples of this so I\'ll let it slide. Besides, the show makes up for it by showing an accurate portrayal of the idol scene, and by not trying to glorify it either.Don\'t be fooled by this show\'s premise or looks. Fancy Lala is a sweet, genuine, and wonderful little anime that will leave you so fulfilled you feel like smiling at the whole world. was the desired audience back then.

But, still, the catchy opening and exceptional artwork (considering the time and perhaps budget) were enough to have me hooked at first glance.As simple as the premise was - young girl encounters magical creatures who grant her the power to transform into the (older) girl she finds herself cartooning about in her spare time - there were so many poignant...moments that viscerally brought the show to life - specifically two off the top of my head, Episode 8 and Episode 12.Miho is, as Lala, completely relatable - she never quite looses that childish charm and naivete, even when she's entering into the more-adult world of modeling and being an idol. There's a sincerity there that genuinely makes you wonder if she's going to come out of alright.The characters are all believable to be honest, and the story moves at a pleasant pace. There isn't much room for fillers, every episode serves its purpose ultimately. And, by the end of the series, we're left with many bittersweet (but ultimately, sweet) feelings swirling in our gut. This show is exceptional, a hidden treasure, and a must for anyone seeking some purity in a world where anime seems to gravitate towards quick-gratification instead or weaving a tale that touches upon our dreams and deep desires. moments that viscerally brought the show to life - specifically two off the top of my head, Episode 8 and Episode 12.Miho is, as Lala, completely relatable - she never quite looses that childish charm and naivete, even when she's entering into the more-adult world of modeling and being an idol.

Yes, in one episode Miho alchemically creates a pet cat. As you can expect from that statement, this series is bonkers, but can also be super fun and has some really serious moments! Too bad the ending was a huge downer!⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersI would have probably rated this series the same ranking as Creamy Mami (a 3★), if there...wasn\'t a suddenly cruel, head-scratcher of an ending. The undertone to Fancy Lala had always been a little bit more mature than the fun, \'80s, reference-filled romp in ""Creamy Mami"" — the series explores themes of children from a suffering marriage, negative press and rumors, and other coming-of-age pains! All of this is, of course, interspersed with filler episodes with transformation shenanigans and, often, spooky ghost stories!The story starts out almost too idyllic for the prescience of a downer ending: a) an eight-year-old girl gets to transform into a teenager, because of a couple of adorable, dinosaur mascots with magic powers, b) she immediately gets scouted by a talent agency because of her good looks, and gets to be closer to her male, idol crush, c) despite ""Lala"" constantly being late or having to attend elementary school, the firm works around her schedule! The whole script plays out like what a third-grader would imagine a talent agency to function like, and what, despite having zero vocal training (after one session), they say that she\'s gifted enough to start performing at concert venues? What an insane progression!So, to then, end the series by having all of her powers suddenly taken away from her... forever, seemed very cruel. Especially, when everyone at the agency now thinks that she was murdered or something, because she\'s a missing person. It even makes it on the news, that the idol singer named ""Lala"" has gone missing. Miho\'s mother is the talent supervisor, so hearing about it at home torments Miho more; and not only that, but when Miho tries to transform using a fusion of her magical sketchbook and her dinosaur buddies\' powers, and the effect of it is... that her small friends disappear... never to be seen again!The series implies that she can become ""Lala"" again, in a few years, after she\'s grown up, but what is she going to say... she\'s been a missing person for half of a decade by that point, and she\'s supposed to just resume her job as a singer, like nothing ever happened? I guess she could introduce herself with her real name and just write off the uncanny resemblance as a coincidence? Or, has the mysterious Mr. Fushigi taken away her powers, to force her to focus on her dream of being a comic book artist? I don\'t even know. And then, her make-up artist reveals that he was once greeted by the mystery man and given magical powers, too. What? What, even, is this ending?On a positive note, I really liked how practical Miho\'s transformations were. In most magical girl shows, the clothes just form over the girls\' bodies, but Miho has to first transmute the outfit out of paranormal paper, and then transform into an adult, to manually put the garments on! It was entertaining to wonder how Miho was going to pull off the switch, since it was harder and has less plot conveniences than the typical mahō shōjo series! And the fact that the magical mascots, are just shrunken dinosaurs was really rad! They are usually cat or dog-like creatures, so the dinosaur angle was as original as the twist of Keroberos (""Cardcaptor Sakura"") actually being a Cerberus-like beast!I also liked Miho\'s ""friend-enemy"" relationship with her rival, Miki Yumeno! I thought their dynamic was interesting, and how much Miki adored Miho\'s mother was really sweet. I wasn\'t the biggest fan of Miho\'s relationship with Taro, though his original seiyū is really talented! It was just two children getting on each other\'s nerves all the time, with Miho being the more diligent and responsible half, and Taro being lazy and kind of stupid, by comparison! Since I already made a juxtaposition with ""Cardcaptor Sakura,"" I will with the romance, too! Syaoran and Sakura are both portrayed as competent, fast-witted, magic users, so that couple was much easier to root for... whereas, Miho and Taro seem like they\'re at complete opposite ends of the spectrum!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Takahiro Ōmori (director), notable works:* Akachan to Boku, ""Baby and Me""* Baccano!* Durarara!!

Despite my qualms with the actual story, the atmosphere is dense with a comfortable, child-like ambience. I specifically liked the moments when Miho would creep up to the rooftop of her family\'s home and talk about her troubles to her dinosaur friends, from within a tranquil garden. It felt really peaceful and cathartic. Anyone who\'s a fan of Natsume Yūjinchō, will know that this man is amazing at creating a pulchritudinous setting!I watched ""Magical Stage Fancy Lala"" with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.Reiko Ōmori as Miho Shinohara, notable roles:* Julie, Kaleido StarCandice Moore as Miho Shinohara, notable roles:* Kanata Saionji, Daa!

From what I can remember, Mr. Atelevich did a pretty good job with Tōya, which is saying something, since Tōya was hands down, my best boy! His characterization of Hiroya Aikawa is also a pretty boy-type of voice, and it works for the character.Other notable seiyū talents: Atsuko Tanaka (Major Motoko Kusanagi in ""Ghost in the Shell"" and Lisa Lisa in ""JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure""), Ryūsuke Ōbayashi (Sōun Tendō in ""Ranma ½"" and  Captain Kiichi Gotō in ""Patlabor""), and Yoshiko Sakakibara (Armaroid Lady in ""Space Cobra"" and Haman Karn ""Kidō Senshi Zēta Gundam"").Conclusively, if you\'re itching for an imaginative magical girl series, then I would give this one a try. It fumbles a little bit, and some episodes can come off as generic, but I truly do think that this series deserves to be more popular. There are some major flaws, but I found amusement in watching it so, I give Mahō no Stage Fancy Lala a 4/10!Rating: ★★☆☆☆ wasn\'t a suddenly cruel, head-scratcher of an ending. The undertone to Fancy Lala had always been a little bit more mature than the fun, \'80s, reference-filled romp in ""Creamy Mami"" — the series explores themes of children from a suffering marriage, negative press and rumors, and other coming-of-age pains! All of this is, of course, interspersed with filler episodes with transformation shenanigans and, often, spooky ghost stories!The story starts out almost too idyllic for the prescience of a downer ending: a) an eight-year-old girl gets to transform into a teenager, because of a couple of adorable, dinosaur mascots with magic powers, b) she immediately gets scouted by a talent agency because of her good looks, and gets to be closer to her male, idol crush, c) despite ""Lala"" constantly being late or having to attend elementary school, the firm works around her schedule! The whole script plays out like what a third-grader would imagine a talent agency to function like, and what, despite having zero vocal training (after one session), they say that she\'s gifted enough to start performing at concert venues? What an insane progression!So, to then, end the series by having all of her powers suddenly taken away from her... forever, seemed very cruel. Especially, when everyone at the agency now thinks that she was murdered or something, because she\'s a missing person. It even makes it on the news, that the idol singer named ""Lala"" has gone missing. Miho\'s mother is the talent supervisor, so hearing about it at home torments Miho more; and not only that, but when Miho tries to transform using a fusion of her magical sketchbook and her dinosaur buddies\' powers, and the effect of it is... that her small friends disappear... never to be seen again!The series implies that she can become ""Lala"" again, in a few years, after she\'s grown up, but what is she going to say... she\'s been a missing person for half of a decade by that point, and she\'s supposed to just resume her job as a singer, like nothing ever happened? I guess she could introduce herself with her real name and just write off the uncanny resemblance as a coincidence? Or, has the mysterious Mr. Fushigi taken away her powers, to force her to focus on her dream of being a comic book artist? I don\'t even know. And then, her make-up artist reveals that he was once greeted by the mystery man and given magical powers, too. What? What, even, is this ending?On a positive note, I really liked how practical Miho\'s transformations were. In most magical girl shows, the clothes just form over the girls\' bodies, but Miho has to first transmute the outfit out of paranormal paper, and then transform into an adult, to manually put the garments on! It was entertaining to wonder how Miho was going to pull off the switch, since it was harder and has less plot conveniences than the typical mahō shōjo series! And the fact that the magical mascots, are just shrunken dinosaurs was really rad! They are usually cat or dog-like creatures, so the dinosaur angle was as original as the twist of Keroberos (""Cardcaptor Sakura"") actually being a Cerberus-like beast!I also liked Miho\'s ""friend-enemy"" relationship with her rival, Miki Yumeno! I thought their dynamic was interesting, and how much Miki adored Miho\'s mother was really sweet. I wasn\'t the biggest fan of Miho\'s relationship with Taro, though his original seiyū is really talented! It was just two children getting on each other\'s nerves all the time, with Miho being the more diligent and responsible half, and Taro being lazy and kind of stupid, by comparison! Since I already made a juxtaposition with ""Cardcaptor Sakura,"" I will with the romance, too! Syaoran and Sakura are both portrayed as competent, fast-witted, magic users, so that couple was much easier to root for... whereas, Miho and Taro seem like they\'re at complete opposite ends of the spectrum!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Takahiro Ōmori (director), notable works:* Akachan to Boku, ""Baby and Me""* Baccano!* Durarara!!

Despite my qualms with the actual story, the atmosphere is dense with a comfortable, child-like ambience. I specifically liked the moments when Miho would creep up to the rooftop of her family\'s home and talk about her troubles to her dinosaur friends, from within a tranquil garden. It felt really peaceful and cathartic. Anyone who\'s a fan of Natsume Yūjinchō, will know that this man is amazing at creating a pulchritudinous setting!I watched ""Magical Stage Fancy Lala"" with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.Reiko Ōmori as Miho Shinohara, notable roles:* Julie, Kaleido StarCandice Moore as Miho Shinohara, notable roles:* Kanata Saionji, Daa!

But this one is so cleverly structured, my rating is supposed to be 7 but because of this particular detail I gave it an 8; the whole thing is self-aware through the ""sketch book"" device of the little girl, and how that connects her to her familial bonds, I think at some point in the middle it\'ll be obvious who the Mystery Man is. I like that, it shows moral awareness and concern for children, so strange...how you could find the complete opposite even within Japanese culture itself. Notice how the folds are made (within the original ones) as childish sketches at both critical and trivial points in the narrative. But it all goes back and forth to that magical sketch book. There\'s no fan service and emphasis on flashy magical transformations and fights, it\'s always the emotional content that drives the story, rather rare for this genre.Then again, we have the original layer or fold that might\'ve created the whole thing, it\'s the ""memories of time"" and the whole paleobiology realm. The fact the story is anchored in something quite realistic and almost crude like that and turning it magical is worthy of praise in itself, Pigu and Mogu are probably one of few characters of this type that I\'ll always carry in my memory. Too adorable, I\'ll miss them too.Finally, and this might be irrelevant if you don\'t follow me personally, but there\'s a cute ""redhead"" who take the lead in the end talking about this original layer.

My Little Goat,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42899/My_Little_Goat,"['My Little Goat is an 11 minute short movie, from the director behind the beloved series Pui Pui Molcar and the director of Inaka Isha. My Little Goat has a wonderful look to it, while managing to be gruesome, almost horrify even for older audiences.Before going further with the review if you haven\'t seen the film, be warned that the film has concepts of sexual assault/abuse of children.My Little Goat has a very simplistic story that turns very horrific. After a wolf eats her children, a goat mother tries to save her children from death via being devoured. After saving almost all of the children,...the mother is unable to find one, Toruku. After these events, the mother finds ""Toruku"" and brings him home after being lost in the woods for a long time.My Little Goat has a touch of innocence to it, while still managing to be very realistic and very dark. With how the film pans out, it links childhood innocence and fantasy with the horrifying truth that some children, that some parents have to deal with in the real world.*spoilers ahead, be warned*What made this more real for me was when Toruku is found by, what I can interpret, his brother. The more fearful Toruku gets, the more that we see that to him, his brother is the wolf in his life, and is the same person who assaults him. While this is seen in two instances, when he reveals his scars, and when Toruku is actually attacked, this becomes very surreal and just generally hard to watch until you know there is a good ending.**The characters play off of each other significantly well. Albeit, there is not much depth to the goat siblings except for the sister goat Toruku gives his shawl to, but the rest of the characters play very significant roles and profundity in background.The story itself was nice and somewhat pleasing, but some aspects of the film will confuse viewers unless you watch the film a couple of times more. There are certain aspects of the film that I feel like not many people will pick up on or understand until there is a second viewing or even a third.The art for this film is very lovely. I\'m very profound of when directors use different media, clay, paint, etc., in their films. Tomoki is known for his needle-point works in him films and I feel like with this film using this kind of material, it adds more of a specialty to it and refines it as notable because it is animated this way.Overall, I fairly enjoyed this short films. I originally found the origins of this through a video edit, I liked how the art looked and watching this, this felt very enjoyable and worth showing to people who peak interest in horror. the mother is unable to find one, Toruku.

Tomoki Misato's retelling of a classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale merely takes the original's skeleton, whereas the central focus is on an entirely different angle toward psychological trauma, be it memories or permanent scars that are difficult to confront. The innocence of a group of baby sheep is exploited for grim imagery, and this could have easily gone in the opposite direction, however, I commend Misato's choice to rotate the moral compass to responsibility, the conscious choice to protect the defenseless. The film's parallel allegories are extremely effective in developing...the ominous air that creeps around in many of the scenes, also contingent on an unsettling score composed of low shrieking and augmented scales, only sparsely releasing to build tension upon the fearful eyes staring at one another.The stop-motion mechanics are very dynamic, utilizing visual techniques that are traditionally seen in digital animation (e.g., jumping into a picture frame, or hiding in a jar). It's storyboarded with consideration of the full view of multiple characters simultaneously making micro-movements for a final sequence that's intricately choreographed, while the camera's approach to this climax is through blocking and below-eye-level shots. The tainted felt material used for the mangled characters eerily contrasts the unharmed sheep, displaying tears in the wool to reveal colors of bruised blue or pink. My Little Goat excels in concurrently producing layers of symbolism, and the sheer success of the narrative in ten minutes is remarkable. I have high hopes for Misato's career, and it seems he's already being recognized for his abilities in his TV debut. A deceptively distorted tale of unconditional acceptance. the ominous air that creeps around in many of the scenes, also contingent on an unsettling score composed of low shrieking and augmented scales, only sparsely releasing to build tension upon the fearful eyes staring at one another.The stop-motion mechanics are very dynamic, utilizing visual techniques that are traditionally seen in digital animation (e.g., jumping into a picture frame, or hiding in a jar).

The three minute run time per episode is fine for the comedy that each episode has, while also telling more about the battles and struggles that Nobunaga had in trying to unite Japan.There is some more serious moments in this season than the previous one, as it shows that Nobunaga's quest is getting more dangerous and its taking its toll on not only himself but his allies as well. The comedy does alleviate the more...serious situations, but the fact that some jokes and gags from the last season are told again in this season, does make them feel repetitive.Its just more of the same as it was last season, just with some more historical characters being introduced and the plot setting up for more big events to happen. With the music still being OK, the character design being decent and the actual historical events while still being a cliff note version of what happened, still being entertaining. Its still a fun little series to watch and to learn a little about history as well. serious situations, but the fact that some jokes and gags from the last season are told again in this season, does make them feel repetitive.Its just more of the same as it was last season, just with some more historical characters being introduced and the plot setting up for more big events to happen.

One Piece: Glorious Island,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16468/One_Piece__Glorious_Island,"['As a fan of One Piece, and Film Z, I couldn\'t resist taking a peek at the 5 minute ""Glorious Island Specials"" paired with it.Being that these are so short, there isn\'t really much to talk about storywise. Does it follow any path of Movie Z? No, it\'s just it\'s own thing. We catch up with the Straw Hats as they are lounging around on the ship, enjoying the sun, getting a nice little bit of rest and relaxation. We do surprisingly get a brief battle thrown in for good measure, but it\'s only there for sake of comedy. It was still a nice addition...though. The rest of the special just includes the cast talking among eachother, to random gags. Nothing special, but it will left me with a smile on my face. I did find one thing a bit odd about this whole thing though. Despite this having the phrase ""Glorious Island"" in the title, the whole thing takes place on the ship. Aside from maybe a brief daydream by Luffy. Might be a nitpick, but thought I should still mention that.Now there is one thing I feel I should definitely talk about regarding the content. For something so short there is actually a pretty hefty amount of fan service thrown into the mix (chests, butts everything). And yes it seems as One Piece progresses we have been seeing more and more of it. However, it\'s REALLY apparent here, which is either a positive or negative depending on how you like your One Piece.The animation really stands out. We get so many beautiful splashes and variety of colors in this, it\'s really appealing to the eye. If you can find these specials in HD, I highly recommend doing so.Sound is good as well, though it\'s reused from the show, so there isn\'t anything new here.Despite the fact that these specials are only about 5 minutes long, I was surprised to see just how well each of the characters held up. They all retained their personalities and quirks we\'ve come to know and love. So much so that I would say that even if someone has never seen One Piece, it would still give you a great idea of what each character is about. Not something very easy to do for such a short amount of screen time.So is ""One Piece: Glorious Island"" deep and a must watch? No not really, but taken as the short special it was made to be, it kept me entertained. The heavy fan service moments may annoy some viewers, so it\'s not a special I can recommend to everyone. However if you\'re looking for a small burst of One Piece antics, there is enough to enjoy here. Sometimes it\'s nice to see what our heroes love to do when they are not saving the day...and that\'s having fun! though.

I would recommend watching these because there so short.I also do feel like these were just short ways to glorify robin and nami in swimsuits ""]"

If this long ass title has not made you the least bit curious about this show, I don\'t know what will.  Anyway, OVA REVIEW TIME!ERABE!(1)  Read the rest of this anime review(2)  Don\'t read the rest of this anime reviewStory (7.78/10):  The story of this OVA is simple.  Our main protagonist Amakusa Kanade has been magically transported into the world of galge, where he must find his way out by completing one of the routes in the game....Seems simple enough, right?  Well, if you have a weird voice in your head making you do all sorts of random crap otherwise you\'ll get serious head pain, then no, it is not.What I find great about this OVA is the fact that it pokes sticks at its parent story, which, in and of itself, is essentially a romantic visual novel that features our main protagonist having to defeat his weird multiple choice thing by ending up with a girl.  (Not kidding, that is the plot of the main series.)  Noucome has always been a show that has been known to poke fun at harem girl troupes by  making its characters extreme versions of them, as well as being just pure unadulterated that for me, amused my Wednesday afternoons with more glee than I really should\'ve had.Overall though, I found this OVA to be a great nonsensical thing to watch as it was a bucket load of fun like its parent story, and overall quite a hilarious experience because it retained the charm that Noucome itself has had throughout its entire run.Overview:+  Fun, visual novel plot+  Good comedyCharacters (7.61/10):  As I had mentioned before, the characters for this OVA are more or less intense versions of harem female troupes.  For example, we have a little sister character whom wants to be everyone\'s little sister, a dandere girl who is WAY too timid, and a snobby busty rich girl, who has fake breasts.  (Honestly though, I love how they make fun of these things.)The characters in the OVA are not really any different from the characters that they were in the original story.  There\'s really no development for the characters, as there really is no dramatic change.  The only reason why the rating I give for this is so high, is because of the fact that these characters are so memorable.The main four characters, Furano, Ouka, Kanade, and my personal favorite, Chocolat, all have their quirks and uniqueness intact.  They all retain their memorable personalities and therefore, for someone who misses the show, like me, it was nice to see the lack of change of the characters that I grew to love.Overview:+  Memorable main cast+  Little to no change from original personalitiesArt and Sound (8.04/10 and 7.42/10):  The art for Noucome is definitely one of its high points.  the show is drawn and animated in a very colorful looking style where certain things like hair color fade off into a darker gradient depending on the length.  Personally, I find this style to be a very fitting one, as it\'s very light and reflects the show very nicely.  As far as difference from the original series, there\'s no lack of detail, so I\'m very pleased with the results.In terms of music, Noucome has for me personally, one of the more bubbly openings that I\'ve heard for a while.  It\'s quite a memorable piece for me because it has that certain oomph and tone that I can just remember it off of the top of my head.  I love this opening quite a lot, but I wouldn\'t say it\'s a masterpiece of music.  (nothing angel beats standards, that\'s for sure.)  Likewise, the OVA had the same ending for the OVA as it did for the original series.Overview:+  Very nicely colorful art+  Good-sounding music+  Quality of both staying relatively the samePersonal Enjoyment (9.09/10):  I know, I know, that\'s a high score.  Noucome for me was a barrel of laughs.  To this day, it still remains as one of my favorite series of all time because of its nonsensical nature, memorable characters, and overall plot.  (Plus, it\'s a comedy/harem show.  I can\'t get enough of those.)When I found out that the show was getting an OVA, I was itching for the thing to come as well, more Noucome.  (Though, waiting for the thing to be subbed was another story...)  Pleasantly, the show delivered and gave me a something that was quite well waited for as in every moment, I enjoyed the comedy that the OVA presented to me.  It was a fun little thing to watch that I feel deserves rewatching more or less.  (Personal reason of course.)Though...there was one, uncomfortable reference that I felt, sort of soured my experience, as it was a reference to a show that to this day, is the only show to get a 1 rating from me.  (IT IS AN ANIME THAT SHALT NOT BE NAMED!)But overall, the OVA was fun.  If you\'ve watched the original Noucome, I would highly recommend watching this OVA, as it is a nice little welcome back to the series and overall, something that I pleasantly enjoyed.  Plus, it\'s fun to hear from the absolute choice narrator man again and also Chocolat\'s strange tendencies with shipping Kanade up with some other guy.Overall Score: (7.50/10)ERABE!(1)  Rate this review Helpful(2)  Rate this review Unhelpful(3)  Go outside and run around your city/town shouting out loud with your arms wide open, ""I\'M A PRETTY PRINCESS!!!""

Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.1 - Tsumi to Batsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37440/Psycho-Pass__Sinners_of_the_System_Case1_-_Tsumi_to_Batsu,"['TL;DR: Basically a bonus case that explores the Sibyl system and supporting characters (namely Ginoza and Mika) a bit more, but breaks little new ground for world-building or the plot overall. 6.5/10-----At 60 minutes, ""Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System Case 1: Crime and Punishment"" is less of a movie and more of a 3-episode bonus arc to Season 2 of Psycho-Pass. Our main focuses are Mika and Ginoza this time around, and fans of Ginoza/Mika can rejoice - they both get plenty of badass scenes, and Gino especially gets a beautiful fight scene towards the end.Make no mistake, however - this is Season 2-level writing,...not Season 1-level. In other words, serviceable but nothing groundbreaking. Villains are pretty bland (though decently designed visual-wise), serving just as plot devices so the writers can make a point about society under the Sibyl System. The case is solved rather conveniently and neatly, and kind of predictably in all honesty.The high points are definitely the characters and the fight scene at the end. Mika finally feels like an actual Inspector with enough redeeming qualities to stand on her own. Ginoza\'s screen-time allows him to showcase further growth in his character since Season 1, and reveal his thoughts on the other characters. The fight scene at the conclusion of the climax gets deserved full praise from me.I was massively disappointed, however, that instead of getting new opening and closing songs after all these years, they simply remixed the OPs/EDs from Season 1/2. Remixes that somehow sound worse than the originals. So, a complete let-down on the music side of things.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and was glad to be back with the characters I fell in love with in Season 1, and kind of liked in Season 2. Definitely don\'t hype yourself up for the story though. And if you have to pay to see it (like I did in theaters), it may not be worth the price of admission unless you\'re a die-hard Psycho-Pass fan. not Season 1-level.

That is the question I sought to answer, or if you prefer my perspective, when coming back to Psycho Pass, after many years. Do we have a team ready to bring some new life to this world, or are we looking for the second coming of Psycho Pass 2, the one that killed the series for several years?First, it is important to establish why the series was so relevant in the first place, the place where people’s fond memories of the series always came from.  The quality of its first season was on its boldness, in presenting tough...questionings of reality, in this dystopia where crime was gone, but the system took most of our freedom alongside it. The setting committed and thrived on the idea of how far we are willing to go in the quest for safety, to control risks, and eliminate negative consequences, having on the other side the meaning of that search, in regards to the end in freedom of choice.What particularly fascinated me on the Psycho Pass world was how it puts mental health as one of its primary issues. Now the aspect is the new defining element of status, worth in society, your chances of finding relations, having a job, future and perspectives all hinged on this. Bringing alongside a new kind of anxiety, need for control, and many issues about mind-altering drugs. Those never-ending conversations on Hue, and psychopass, referencing the same idea.Sure, the series is hardly innovative, or has something new to say on any given topic, you can find similar, but more though provoking content in works like Clockwork Orange, or Minority Report.Nevertheless, the way Psycho Pass mixed the theme exploration with pulpy bloody action was really fun. The show never seemed sure, if it wanted to be a noir series, filled with style, gunfights, explosions, and epic action set pieces every episode, or to more directly portray ideas, and the subject matter. While those conflicted ambitions never truly worked well together, they made for a complex surface, which is cool enough regardless.So if you miss the old mixture of sci-fi exploration, with the fun bullshit of a thriller detective story, you better forget about it, because the writers clearly did the same. This movie is extremely straightforward on its choices and topics, and on how it tries (and fails) to only be a fun crime story. Please do not think of only this observation as a death sentence (even though, yeah the lack of ambition is part of what kills the movie).This is the textbook example, of a narrative that goes through the basic motions, while barely trying something new. If you have seen a movie before you know what to expect, you have tired twists, a couple of cliffhangers, the constant whodunit moments, and the well know questions on what is really happening. Coupled together with the generic sadistic villains, the strong cool dude, accompanied by the women preaching her ideals in long monologues.You could make an argument the standard story is intentional, the movie is trying to carve a new status quo, dynamics and characters for the upcoming series, after a long hiatus. Even on this regard, how little is achieved is hard to forgive. Our main characters, which are supposedly the thing the movie means to establish, come off as simples as they could.  Ginoza is now your tough noir detective dude, and Mika is the irritable brat, trying to prove her worth, and showing real competence when the time calls for. Basically those typical stereotypes are our “new” mains, the movie never allowing much interpersonal conflict, to emphasize their conflicting worldviews and ideologies.So what is left is a movie treading no new ground,  giving us only a new institution, which is meant to exemplify another contradiction in the system (like we do not have enough of those already). Not even its few actions scenes are memorable, leave much impact, or thrill. Ginoza fighting a mech, might come off as cool when watching, but is no Motoko Kusanagi taking out a tank with her bare hands.The movie is not a complete waste of time, however. The aesthetics are beautiful, placing the story and events in a scenario of dreamy snowy mountains, and mines. So, not much of the flavor of now tiresome oppressive dystopian cities (The blade runner standard aesthetic for the genre). Again we are introduced to the ludicrous never working Sybil system, that appears to malfunction in every episode. Psycho Pass always presented a fun world, with the crazy talking gun, whose job consists of judging people and turning them to bloody pulp, the weird new technologies. In addition, it brings back the old all-seeing lady, which is the personification of the totalitarian system, while always being clueless to everything happening.In conclusion, the anime never managed to answer my desires, or gave me anything to hope in regards to the series to come. Perhaps there is still a narrative to be told in the Psycho Pass universe, one which progress its concepts, world and characters, but this was certainly not it.Also, the guy who though this new OP, and ED were a good idea, has no notion, of what he is doing. He managed to both remind me about the better older show, I preferred to be watching, while managing to make the original songs way worse, with the remixing, so fuck you. questionings of reality, in this dystopia where crime was gone, but the system took most of our freedom alongside it.

Why?The animations are on point, pretty much on the same par with anime itself. Although colors shouldn\'t matter as much as in S2, you can observe a darker tone in most scenes. I can\'t address the CGI part itself, since I\'m not knowledgeable, but it doesn\'t seem overused, unlike for example: the movie adaptation of the original Berserk anime, or any modern mech-anime.Most characters returning from S2 live up to their expectations. What probably annoys most people, including...myself, is the new palette of characters which seem to simply cover the holes of some stereotypes: masked villain, torturer, badass veteran, etc. We are used with thought-provoking and remarkable villains such as Makishima and Kamui and as such, the choice for this role, for example, is indeed quite boring by comparison. I understand that this movie might have the purpose of developing Mika and Ginoza for S3, but they could have chosen a different approach for the new characters. Overall, it reminds me of the ending scene in Rogue One: every new character dies and thus their whole purpose too.Soundtrack is very good, though this expectable since most of it comes from S1 and S2. It complements the dialogue, fighting and even intermediate scenes such as the pursuit of Ginoza and Mika launched by the Sanctuary.The plot simply attempts, in a panting manner, to cover too many concepts in a short amount of time (1h) and as such, it fails to exceed in reflecting anything else than what has already been told throughout S1 and S2. I can understand that the scope of this movie was to develop some characters, but the narrative background of choice matters too. It doesn\'t particulary mean that I didn\'t enjoy most of it. I really enjoyed both of Mika\'s speeches (Sanctuary chief and vs Karasuma), the whole concept of Sanctuary (which reminded me of what really happens in the prisons from northern european countries at some degree) and the empathic approach for the intrigue of the movie (the parental love). And maybe there were more, but I may have failed to absolutely understand the whole plot.So: Why it gets an 8 and not a 7.5? Simply because I had to mention S1 and S2. Without such a complex background, the movie would feel a bit worse, since it struggles to explain in detail the interactions with the PP universe because of its low time limit of 1h.P.S.: To be honest, I don\'t think I have understood all the ideas and the judgement behind them that the whole PP tries to convey. It is often good to remind that ""the most dangerous prison is the one you don\'t see"". myself, is the new palette of characters which seem to simply cover the holes of some stereotypes: masked villain, torturer, badass veteran, etc. We are used with thought-provoking and remarkable villains such as Makishima and Kamui and as such, the choice for this role, for example, is indeed quite boring by comparison. I understand that this movie might have the purpose of developing Mika and Ginoza for S3, but they could have chosen a different approach for the new characters. Overall, it reminds me of the ending scene in Rogue One: every new character dies and thus their whole purpose too.Soundtrack is very good, though this expectable since most of it comes from S1 and S2.

The (original) movie was a return to near-s1 quality in some aspects but cut down the mystery and tone of the TV seasons.Psycho Pass SS Case 1 is a 1hr movie continuing the series from where it left off, and brings back Mika, Akane, and Ginoza investigating a mysterious site where latent criminals are kept as workers.Although there is a mystery present in the first half of the film most of the loose ends are uneventfully closed, probably to keep the runtime down,...but still keeping enough to make the movie satisfying with a main mystery developing in the middle of the movie.Art looks fairly standard for the series, a bit more noticeable cgi than before - likely to continue in the other SS entries and the soon-to-release S3.Music consists of a remixed s1 OP and ED combination that doesn't sound as good as the excellent originals, but has some nice visuals, and some familiar sounding bgm tracks that are still pleasant to hear.Overall, the series is worth watching for anyone that enjoys the series and has already seen all prior entries. It doesn't break any new ground but has a satisfying conclusion and story, especially for it's short length compared to other arcs. With 2 more SS entries, and 8 confirmed long episodes for s3 starting in late october, there is about to be an abundance of content for fans of the series. For those expecting a return to s1 quality, wait for S3 and hope it's good. but still keeping enough to make the movie satisfying with a main mystery developing in the middle of the movie.Art looks fairly standard for the series, a bit more noticeable cgi than before - likely to continue in the other SS entries and the soon-to-release S3.Music consists of a remixed s1 OP and ED combination that doesn't sound as good as the excellent originals, but has some nice visuals, and some familiar sounding bgm tracks that are still pleasant to hear.Overall, the series is worth watching for anyone that enjoys the series and has already seen all prior entries.

I´m in the minority that liked season 2 quite a lot as well. And I even found the first movie half-decent. But this? No story, no character development, no action, no nothing. Sure, art and sound are quite good but... who cares if everything else is so poor?The worst offender is the totally absurd and nonsensical plot. Without going into any kind of spoilers, just remember that in Psycho-Pass world there are TONS of drones and robots for industrial and police work, as it has been established in previous...seasons.

Nobody's motivations really make sense and the conspiracy they hype up, as well as the resolution to it, are honestly laughable. Like you're either going to cringe or laugh; it's that dumb.The characters are flat as hell in this movie, especially Mika, who they decided to essentially completely rewrite because she sucked so much in S2. The result is you have a character that acts completely different despite having no development...to do so.So basically: story sucks, characters suck, art looked great as always, sound was good.

Not bad, just... alright.So, art and sound-wise, Psycho-Pass is still doing all the wonderful things it always has. The BGM in this film still kicks during the fast-paced scenes, and the wide shots of buildings and landscapes still looks gorgeous. This film does also animate its fight scenes extremely well. This film did keep the fighting to a minimum, though, which is unfortunate because it's one of the things this series does best.Character-wise, I loved getting to relax with these characters again. I've always...thought the cast balanced itself out very nicely, and this film was no different. I was glad to see that really well-written chemistry between characters come to life between Mika and Ginoza for this film. Story-wise is where we hit a speed bump. It wasn't that the story was poorly written-- in fact, Psycho-Pass usually does well when it comes to telling a story and handing down information as it's needed. The issue was just that it wasn't too terribly interesting. Psycho-Pass, I think, works a lot better when there's a long-haul sort of plot to unfold, so this one-hour format didn't suit it. It felt slightly rushed, and a bit weird to have a plot that only lasts for the duration of this film. That being said, I did feel like we got to see a bit of character development and world-building that wasn't really seen before now, so the story wasn't all off-kilter.If nothing else, I was just glad to hang out with these characters again, killer story or not.

Their case involving Izumi Yasaka, a psychological counselor in Sanctuary, a Latent Criminal Isolation Facility out in Aomori where they have to escort Yasaka back to the facility but with some investigating, things aren\'t as it seems in this ""paradise"".Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.1 - Tsumi to Bachi seems to be taking place during the second season BUT retconned the ""point of no return"" scenarios as they somewhat retain some of their second season stuff (also the other...tip off being Shou Hinakawa being there). What this movie actually greatly improved on immediately in watching this movie was Mika as a whole as the second season absolutely assassinated her character but this movie gave her a bit of justice in this respect as a result giving off the vibe of her steadfast and ""action first, talk later"" take on investigating that Akane is the exact opposite take on so it was kinda refreshing and new to see Mika actually take on a case. Like Mika still has her extremely strong sense of justice and it was greatly shown through her investigation of the facility.Ginoza has some good character development reinforced with his contrast and comparison to one of the higherups of the facility of Rojion and the entire ""hunting dog and puppy"" take on with this as Rojion thinks him being free makes him a ""hunting dog"" within the facility while he sees Ginoza as a puppy obeying all orders to his Inspector. The dynamic of Rojion and Ginoza does show of Ginoza staying by the law and not trying to end up like Kougami and much like Mika stick to the sense of justice and finish the case. Rojion on the other hand for LA sees, is what would of happened if Kougami was let loose and let his justice darken under a corrupted higherups at that. The dynamic between the two was pretty interesting as a result.All the while Mika, Ginoza and Yayoi are in Aomori, Akane and the rest dig into the case and much like Yayoi gives not only the audience but clears any holes within the case at hand. Well with Mika and Ginoza being in focus, it\'s kinda expected for Akane to take a step back with this one and generally give them backup.The entire case in hindsight gives us a microcosm of the Sibyl System and it\'s problems much like what the first season was trying to in trying to outright destroy it from the inside out. The analogies are all there, the Sanctuary being Sibyl System, the higherups of Tsujicho being Joushuu Kasei, the rest of the staff  being the enforcers and the inmates being the population under the jurisdiction of the Sibyl System and heck even the final moments in wrapping up the case, Mika confronts this to the instigator to bringing light of this case having links to Sibyl as well.Side Note: It\'s kinda fitting for the setting to be in Aomori as it\'s where one of the ruthless prisons in Japan (that of Abashiri Prison and the infamous escape artist Yoshie Shiratori) resided, so it\'s like Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.1 - Tsumi to Bachi is also taking on what happens with the Sibyl System in prison and the ""treatment"" it gives to it\'s inmates.The animation done once again by Production IG, well it\'s Production IG and not even their test cases, they went all out with the animation with this one, everything from the character designs, backgrounding and the action scenes and uncensored as always. As for the voice cast, Ayane Sakura did exceptional with her devil may care attitude as Mika, Kenji Nojima got to flex his cadence a bit as Ginoza and as much as Yayoi was backup, Shizuka Ito was great as well. LA\'s favorite voice actor oddly enough became Ayane Sakura, thank for the fact that this movie gave LA a different tune about Mika as a result.Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.1 - Tsumi to Bachi feels like a good direction and even recovery from the dismal second season\'s damage it did to the franchise and sure it was an isolated case but from patient zero finally getting recovered and showing her actual true self of Mika was a great step forward and for an isolated case still had some thematic relevance to the series so it wasn\'t a throwaway case much like the first Psycho Pass movie.

I have coupled through the second season, it turned out decent, not as bad as people say, of course, when you're missing one of the best antagonists “Makashima”, then it's excusable.The brutal detective thriller has started to fade out of my memories, with only the biggest moments still brought up by me to this day on my Anime discussions, but watching through this movie was like cycling through my collective memory folders that relate to this Anime, remember every detail fro the series as I sit through the whole thing.Story...(7/10):Something I found very un-Pasycho-Pass-y is the simplistic outline of the plot. I couldn't help but notice how straight forward the whole thing is, with the movie starting up by setting a mental facility. Introducing characters whom expressions scream if “I'm the bad guy”. It felt like a solved case as soon as it began, which made it more of an action-oriented case than one that demands critical thinking and mystery thriller that the parent show excelled at.Art (8/10):I'm always a complainer whenever I see CGI heavily used on an Anime, however, Psycho-Pass has always been one of the exceptions. The 2D and 3D elements communicate flawlessly, sometimes, even hiding the fact that what's going on the screen is fully CG.Character design is one of the strongest visual strength that I love about this series. It does the realistic anatomy so well, that you might mistake it as a rotoscoped live action. I like the backgrounds as well as how well they manage to blend all the animated elements into a fully digestible visual package.Sound (8/10):Hearing the first opening of the first season was all I needed to approve this aspect of the movie. It is just so good, it stands the test of time and it brought back the same chills it did back when I was first watching the series episode by episode.The voice acting is appreciable, no overly-cute moe moans, just a trembling audion that shows how horrifying the played scenario is.The OSTs are spanking, straight up.Character (8/10):What I think is a reason enough for anyone to watch this movie lies in the characters. No, I don't mean the general cast, but speaking specifically about Miku.It's a popular opinion in the fandom how hated Miku is. I sided with the same mentality here, but not for so long.It seems like a character arc for her, this entire movie is just her taking on a case, showing us the third party, how it's done, she no longer whines, she no longer hesitates. She is the inspector everyone wanted her to become.A word for the antagonists, not anything that leaves a lasting impression, pretty forgettable if you asked me as I'd take any minor village from the TV show over these two.Enjoyment (8/10):What a comeback. Just about to time delve into the three movies and the third season, and oh boy, I say it again. What a start.Just the kind of movies that puts you on the run, a quick recap of what the show is about, building up for what to come next.Although the case at hand was not anything of immersing like the show spoiled us, but the spirit and the adrenaline rush is there when the moment calls for it.Overall (7.8/10):For a long-time-breaker, someone that hasn't seen the show in what counts by the ages, yes, definitely see it. It is not going to give you anything new per se. But it does bring back the topping and the appeal of the first two seasons. I would still put the first major movie “Psycho-Pass: The movie” above this any day though. (7/10):Something I found very un-Pasycho-Pass-y is the simplistic outline of the plot.

This movie at the very least has more depth than just people shooting each other.The movie begins with a woman named Izumi Yasaka, a latent criminal, arrives at the Tokyo police station and turns herself in while asking for help but she can hardly speak. Turns out she escaped from a special facility for latent criminals called ""Sanctuary"", where the public safety ministry has no authority and therefore reluctantly agrees to repatriate her, but it is obvious she\'s...terrorized by it. Inspector Shimotsuki and enforcers Ginoza and Kunizuka accompany her and inspect the facility. At first glance it seems to be a paradise compared to the regular correction facilities, but something about the behavior of the staff just doesn\'t feel right.This movie is more of a thriller genre and less psychological so I wouldn\'t say it\'s as good as the first season of the TV anime, but is still well-made. It\'s also the first time in the franchise where inspector Tsunemori is not the main character (she does appear but not frequently), which will (unfortunately) be the case in the future as well.Art and sound are just the same as the TV anime so I give the same score.

So this is basically his anime debut as a writer.And for a writer debut, especially a debut in the Pycho Pass Franchise, this movie is quite fair. Nothing special, nothin great not even pretty good. BUT considering the fact that all these other so called ""writers"" have more ""expierence"" but still managed to fuck up the whole PP Universe with the quickness, you have to give Ryo Yoshigami special credit for actually knowing what the fuck he was doing...unlike his companians. Thats why I gave this case file a 6, even tho just from a pure PP standpoint its probably just a 5.The movie is basically a Stand Alone Tile in the franchise and doesn\'t claim any association with previous or later PP installments. Its literally just a case that needs to get solved by the bureau. But this fact actually helps the movie to be somewhat enjoyable and makes up for good fanservice and even a little action and tension. You don\'t have to worry about plotholes neither.If you wanna say a last goodbye to this cash grabbing machine that Psycho Pass now has become, I actually would recommand watching this movie for a last dose of at least acceptable PP goodness. unlike his companians.

Though this film feels slightly different as there's another new writer here, Yoshigami, who is clearly a Mika fan. Anyways. it's a solid entry.Case 1 rectifies Mika's arc in Season 2. But really, given how badly that season went, it would've fit better after S1 or the first film. Either way, it...does a great job of redeeming/developing her character and her subsequent promotion later on feels earned.Case 1 also explores Ginoza's character a fair bit, giving us more insight on his resolved turmoil with Kogami, and how he's been adapting to life after Masaoka's death. does a great job of redeeming/developing her character and her subsequent promotion later on feels earned.Case 1 also explores Ginoza's character a fair bit, giving us more insight on his resolved turmoil with Kogami, and how he's been adapting to life after Masaoka's death."", 'Title should\'ve been Psycho-Pass: Mika appreciation film.Every single moment in the movie, Shimotsuki Mika is extremely expressive and have the the most detailed animations. The director for this film is clearly a Mika simp. I like Mika too but theres a limit to everything. The team really put a lot of emphasis on Mika. Mika KAWAII.This is a *SPOILER-FREE* review.Story 2/10If plot-holes did not exist, then perhaps the story would get a 5/10 pass. The story director or the story writer for this section of the psycho-pass universe clearly underperforms. From a well-written story of Psycho Pass Season 1, to this crap. Clearly, milking the...dead dog is the last thing you should do if you want to revive interest in the Psycho Pass franchise. Rather than take the time to some research, the story of Psycho Pass Sinners of the system case 1 is nothing more than ideas mushed up in the worst way possible. A false attempt at making a rather simple plot appear as complex.Art 8/10As always, production IG animation department knows what they are doing. Every scene blend well together. Nothing much can be said other than it is amazing. Just like in Season 1, 2, and the movie (2015) the animation and art standards are extremely high. CGI is used very professionally. I don\'t anyone could hate the art.Sound 6/10The opening and ending theme are merely remix of already reused OST. The ost by itself is good, but when you add this useless remix of EDM it is rather questionable. I don\'t mind when OST are being reused but at least do the music justice by not remixing it. Voice acting as always, fits each characters. Not once, did the voice of any characters felt weird or out of place. Sadly, nothing new is added. Background OST, SFX, these are all reused, and thats fine for it is used properly. My only complain is the dumb decision to remix the opening and ending of Season 1 and then slap it onto this movie.Character 5/10Character design by itself is always good. But what was done poorly is once again tied with the poor story. Out of nowhere, characters just ""happen"" to do things. In Season 1, none of this unexplainable stuff just ""happens."" Many times, the story just goes ""i don\'t care, i write whatever i want to write"" which is evident in the many scenes portrayed. Antagonist characters were well defined, but it always felt short. As if many scenes about them were removed from the final cut of this film. Overall, each characters were true to their nature which is the only reason that this gets rated 5/10.Enjoyment 5/10I watch this, because I\'m not the type to just drop an anime. Once I start it, I will continue it all the way until the end. I just wish Sinners of the System Case 1 could be written better. Everything just seems like a lazy attempt to make Psycho-Pass interesting. Unlike Season 1 and 2 which I would strongly recommend anyone to watch it and also re-watch it. This film does not deserve to be re-watch. Only watch it because you like Psycho Pass and want the full story. For the sake of the Psycho-Pass universe, I will continue onwards to Psycho Pass: Sinners of the System Case 2. dead dog is the last thing you should do if you want to revive interest in the Psycho Pass franchise.

The ost by itself is good, but when you add this useless remix of EDM it is rather questionable. I don\'t mind when OST are being reused but at least do the music justice by not remixing it. Voice acting as always, fits each characters. Not once, did the voice of any characters felt weird or out of place. Sadly, nothing new is added. Background OST, SFX, these are all reused, and thats fine for it is used properly. My only complain is the dumb decision to remix the opening and ending of Season 1 and then slap it onto this movie.Character 5/10Character design by itself is always good. But what was done poorly is once again tied with the poor story. Out of nowhere, characters just ""happen"" to do things. In Season 1, none of this unexplainable stuff just ""happens."" Many times, the story just goes ""i don\'t care, i write whatever i want to write"" which is evident in the many scenes portrayed. Antagonist characters were well defined, but it always felt short. As if many scenes about them were removed from the final cut of this film. Overall, each characters were true to their nature which is the only reason that this gets rated 5/10.Enjoyment 5/10I watch this, because I\'m not the type to just drop an anime. Once I start it, I will continue it all the way until the end. I just wish Sinners of the System Case 1 could be written better. Everything just seems like a lazy attempt to make Psycho-Pass interesting. Unlike Season 1 and 2 which I would strongly recommend anyone to watch it and also re-watch it. This film does not deserve to be re-watch. Only watch it because you like Psycho Pass and want the full story. For the sake of the Psycho-Pass universe, I will continue onwards to Psycho Pass: Sinners of the System Case 2.', 'Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System Case.1 - Tsumi to Bachi serves as a direct sequel to Psycho-Pass II having it\'s primary focus on Inspector Mika Shimotsuki and Enforcer Ginoza.ACTUAL REVIEW :Story : 6/10.This story can be best described as a S2 story writing without any ""disturbance"" in plot by own allies.Story Summary :(Potential Spoilers)An unusual incident occurs - The case seems deeper than it is in surface - No direct cooperation from Sibyl system - introduction to the shady enemy hideout - threads become lose one after another as story progresses - A cool action scene - Dio-Jotaro moment - Villains dead - Case...not closed - Oh It was ....\'s plan all along.Now I\'m happy that the story writing did improve compared to S2 but paled in comparison to S1.Art : 7/10.A consistent art-animation as previous seasons.

Inspector Mika Shimotsuki did grow-up on me,,just by a lil. bit and watching her in a scene wasn\'t as enraging as watching S2 and Psycho-Pass Movie and her progression as a character was a major highlight for me.On the Other hand, the villains/antagonists of this movie were just bad, no form of evil presence was felt while watching them. Copy-paste a bad-character archeotype with a weird hiearchy and you\'d get the antagonists of this movie.Enjoyment : 8/10.I love Psycho-Pass series. Regardless of the villains or plot, my attention is mainly toward Sibyl System and it\'s effect on the MCs and vice versa. Considering this movie as a prequel to S3, it served as a good watch.Final Vedict : 7/10This is just an hour long movie focusing on a case and it is fairly interesting as a stand-alone movie.And yeah,this story is a cannon.If you just hate Inspector Mika Shimotsuki then you might not like this as the primary focus is on her. But watching this isn\'t a loss if you like Psycho-Pass series as it\'ll make easier to understand her character who\'s relevant in S3. not closed - Oh It was ....\'s plan all along.Now I\'m happy that the story writing did improve compared to S2 but paled in comparison to S1.Art : 7/10.A consistent art-animation as previous seasons.

The premise is interesting, so far the story was almost solely focused on the sibyl system so it\'s an interesting idea to show other government agencies and how they interact with the inspector. Well, at least it would have been if the other agency wasn\'t so dumb. And the premise is really the only part with potential the rest is cliché, with forced...""twist"", and the ending somehow managed to be even worse than the rest.Characters: I\'m only going to speak of the ones introduced for that film since there\'s not much to say about the one introduced in previous seasons. They\'re all absolutely terrible, the supporting cast is bland and uninteresting, but the villains are where it gets really bad.First, they\'re cliché, the instant you see them it\'s obvious that they\'re the villains just from the way they look: you got the hunched back mad scientist, the sexually inappropriate nurse, the bad mercenary who also a rival, and finally the cult leader with a creepy smile.Secondly, they\'re dumb and wouldn\'t look out of place in your average (bad) children cartoon.Also, they tried to flesh out a bit more some of the executioners but since the new characters they\'re made to interact with are so uninteresting it doesn\'t work.art: meh, the CG isn\'t that great but it looks alright, definitely worst than what came before tho.sound: Most of it is okay, again not as good as before but not bad... except for one thing, the VA for Izumi Yasaka (the drugged woman who crashes into the HQ at the start of the movie) does a terrible job, considering the lines she had to work with though, she probably isn\'t to blame.Overall, don\'t watch it, almost everything in that movie is bad. And I\'ve yet to watch the other 2 cases but it doesn\'t really seem like the event of that film will matter anyway.

Planet With,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37578/Planet_With,"['The summer 18 anime season is a pretty rough season for anime that are not squeals mainly because it was the season that was filled with forgetful seasonal anime such as Harukana Receive, Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs and Angolmois: Genkou Kassenki. This was also the season gave us broken and boring dumpster fires like Back Street Girls, Island and my personal favorite The Master of Rock Bottom (The Master of Ragnarok & Blesser of Einherjar). Thankfully in this rabbit hole of a season, there were a few hidden gems and great shows such as Banana Fish, Cells At Work, High Score, Grand Blue...and Planet With which\xa0is by far the most underrated show of the season for me. While Planet With did not dominate the Summer 18 season as I enjoyed J.C Staff other show from this season High Score Girl as well the more intriguing Banana Fish. It was still better than everything from this season alone.So what made this show so good may ask? Let\'s find out, shall we?Story.The story of Planet With follows a young high schooler named Soya Kuroi Soya Kuroi who is living a peaceful life despite having no memories of his past. Along with his peaceful life he is living with a large cat named Sensei and a maid named Ginko. One day, strange floating beasts appear in the sky above Japan, and conventional weapons are useless against them until seven men and women transform into powerful weapons and destroy them. Sōya finds himself pressed into battle, fighting not against the beasts, but against the seven heroes instead, as he becomes an unwitting pawn in an interstellar war that has come to Earth.The story for Planet With is great and interesting.For starters, the story is very easy to follow as not only the knows gets straight to the point narratively but the story completely avoids all the traps that plagued the mecha anime genre such as big info dumps, unneeded fan-service, wish fulfillment, edge, lack of focus and bad filler content.The first 4 episodes of Planet With are pretty episodic but after episode 4 the show completely leaves it episodic roots by going for a different direction and the direction that it took, in the end, was great that is filled with great writing and story elements. The best thing about Planet With was how unpredictable it was. Compare to any other anime in the season Planet With is filled with interesting exciting story moments that were, for the most part, were well executed.The show is for the most part well paced as the show moves at a smooth pace where the viewer can understand what is going on screen.Even though the story of Planet With was pretty great I have two minor nitpicks with it.While the show was indeed easy to follow for the most part, however, there were a couple of times where the show became a bit too complex and a bit hard to follow. Don\'t get me wrong this is pretty easy to follow, for the most part, however, there were certain story elements in that can be a bit tricky to fully understand especially if you\'re a new anime fan. This was not an issue for me, however, I can understand why newer anime fans would fell lost and confused while watching this show at times.Also while the show was a great ride that I really enjoyed, however, I honestly thought the show was way too short for its own good.This is more of a personal complaint but I thought that this show could have been 24 episodes long. Yes, the ending was great as it was not rushed and manages to conclude the series very well but there was a small part of me wanted this show to be longer. Oh well, you can\'t have them all I guess.Overall the story of Planet With was great.8.5/10Characters.The characters in Planet With are pretty cool and enjoyable.Soya is a pretty great mecha protagonist. Not only he is a likable character in his own right but he is a well written who develops very well. Not to mention his backstory and motivation for revenge was well told and intriguing. He\'s is far better than that lifeless potato named Hiro from Darling in the Franxx.Next, we have Ginko who is by far favorite character in this show. Outside of being my favorite Waifu of this season, she is a fun and interesting character that I really enjoyed from start to finish. I really enjoyed her character chemistry with Soya as feels like a great sister for Soya.The other characters in this show are very good that are not only well developed but they all fun and entertaining characters that have charm.Overall the characters in Planet With were pretty awesome.9/10Visuals.Visually Planet With is very good.The character and background designs were pretty great and appealing to look at. There was hardly any art failures in this show manages to use its production values budget very well.The mecha designs are solid overall. Yes, the mechs are in CGI but for once it actually works as this show almost perfectly manages to blend in CGI mecha into traditional 2D animation. Sensei mecha form itself is easily the best mecha design of 2018. Yes the mecha itself at first may look like SD Destiny Gundam but what it can do in combat says otherwise not mention the use of blue sci-fi color palette for the mecha was great as the mech was made from a competent mecha designer instead of a talentless hack who designed the cringe-inducing mech designs from Darling in the Franxx. As for the other mechs they were all pretty good for what they were especially Kakka mecha form.The animation in Planet With is pretty good overall as it\'s very smooth and the fight choreography for the mecha fights was awesome.Awesome job J.C Staff8.5/10Sound.The soundtrack in Planet With is awesome. Not only the music by itself was a great listen as all of the tracks have that great sci-fi dubstep but it masterfully blends in well with the show plot and setting.The opening theme One Unit\'\' by Minami is a fantastic opening theme that is not only epic song in its own right but it perfectly captures the tone of the series.The ending theme Rainbow Planet"" by Mai Fuchigami is a pretty good ending overall.The voice acting in this show is great as every single Seiyuu did a great job with the roles that they were given.It\'s such a shame that Planet With hasn\'t got a Simulcast English Dub. Then again Funimation would rather simulcast Isekai train-wrecks like The Master of Rock Bottom and How to Not Summon a Demon Lord. Hopefully, this show gets the English Dub that it deserves.10/10Final Thoughts.I had a blast watching Planet With.Yes, it may not be my favourite anime from this season as I prefer Banana Fish and High Score Girl over this show but I still think that Planet With is better than most of the throwaway anime from this season.The story was pretty great and enjoyable. The characters were amazing and well developed, the visuals were great and the soundtrack was awesome. Honestly I mecha genre completely redeemed themselves after that shameless train-wreck that was Darling in the Franxx.If you\'re looking for a good modern mecha anime that is well executed and has intriguing characters then I strongly recommend Planet With.Planet With is one of the best animes I have ever seen and I say thank you to the creators for making this wonderful mecha series. It may not be in the same league as Gurren Lagann, Eureka Seven and Gundam The Origin but it\'s still one hell of an awesome mecha anime that I love.Final Score 9/10 and Planet With which\xa0is by far the most underrated show of the season for me.

It may not be in the same league as Gurren Lagann, Eureka Seven and Gundam The Origin but it\'s still one hell of an awesome mecha anime that I love.Final Score 9/10', 'Piloting a mech with ripple patterned eyes. Such peculiar machine with a high school boy at its seat. Living with a cat creature and an adorable maid. If this short bucket list strike as an unusual setup for a story, then you’re damn right. Planet With is an original anime that takes science fiction to a surreal level. It’s an adventure that unites a variety of gimmicks together with plenty of surprises.Anyone familiar with Satoshi Mizukami’s work will probably point out his more well-known series such as “Lucifer and the Biscuit” and “Spirit Circle”. He takes his unusual cast of characters and bring creativity to...life. Through some of his works, I realized that Planet With would bring out a familiar feeling. And oh boy, it succeeded in more ways than one. Nonetheless, I think it’s important to first understand what Planet With is really about.The main story is about a boy named Souya Kuroi. He is a typical high school student with an apparent amnesia. The first episode establishes his role as he gets involved in a battle against strange floating beings known as the Nebula. First impression of the series makes me wonder if it was destiny that caused Souya to get involved in such an event. In other words, perhaps this event wasn’t just coincidental but that he was destined to fulfill his role as something much bigger than he’s ever imagined. Nonetheless, Souya also gets caught into conflict with the Grand Paladin, a group of individuals with their own unique powers. The show depicts them as a mysterious group whose goals lies in unfamiliar territories until much later on in the show. However, the heart of the show deals with Souya’s role as he regains more and more of his memories. We learn more about his past including his home planet and origins. He’s definitely a complex character that’s hard to read between the lines. In fact, Souya is less of the typical protagonist and initially portrayed as antagonist. You heard me right. His actions in the show is portrayed more as going against the  heroic role. The first few episodes has him go up against Grand Paladin while also connecting with them when he’s not in his mech. In doing so, the show creates a sensation of mystery as how much we should really try to understand Souya. I think in many ways, Mizukami’s creativity shows for making a character like Souya as he is deceptively complex. There may be the type of audience that will understand Souya easier if you’re familiar with his work. But even if you’re someone lost in the dark, Souya is still a character you’d want learn more. Many questions will pop up throughout the show like why he’s living with an oversized cat or dream about dragons.As I watched more and more of Planet With, the experience became more of going with the flow and enjoying what the creator presents to us. Its ideas are otherworldly and the plot is carried by the actions of the characters. In fact, there’s an easy trend of action result in consequences throughout the show. Besides Souya, the Grand Paladin is a prominent example with its faction of members. Even their leaders have hidden agendas that far eclipses than just defeating some aliens. Many of its members are actually unaware of their true intentions as well. Members of the Grand Paladin such as Benika and Yousuke begins to question their own organization after certain events in the show. Then, there are others who follows the organization’s code to the letter. Individually, I think members of Grand Paladin are unique with their own personalities and character chemistry between each other. A noticeable example is Miu and Harumi with their childhood friendship/rivalry. In the earlier episodes, Miu wants to truly prove to herself especially to Harumi in battle. This results in disastrous consequences that nearly costs her life. But to be honest, I think the show does an exceptional job at taking risks like this. It puts the audience in their seat to see how far characters to go to accomplish their goals. In doing so, it also made me get invested into these characters with their unpredictability.That being said, there are definitely some characters that stands out compare to others. Sensei (the purple cat) is an easy example to point out not just for his unusual characteristics but also for his revelation later in the story. Others such as the Grand Paladin leader Takashi Ryuuzoji makes you curious about his true motives. Hell, even that maid Ginko Kuroi should spark more than just interest once you see what she can do. However, characters like Nozomi and Judgement are portrayed more as comic relief. Like I said before, some characters stand out more than others and not everyone can steal the spotlight. Souya’s character growth is also important to note as the more memories he recovers, the more he matures. Despite that, the show is still known for its various running gags such as Souya’s insatiable desire to eat meat. In general, I think the comedy in this show is a bit peculiar. It never relies on shock or fan service. Instead, it presents it in a sort of kooky and sarcastic way. The dialogues comes out naturally but sometimes mixes in silly words to make conversation flow like an oddball. Take it as you’d like but if this is your first time seeing a Mizukami work, then it should be an unique experience.There are many ways to describe the art style of Planet With but I find the word ‘surreal’ to be one of the more accurate representations. My first glance at the mecha designs immediately gave me a weird insight on its context. The ripple pattern eyes and cat-like ears is definitely an unusual design that I’ve not seen in many of the mecha series I’ve seen before. Furthermore, there are the Nebula that takes weirdness to another level such as the abnormal looking dolls or inverted babies. Oh and let’s not forget sensei with his idiosyncratic look. On the other hand, the human-looking characters in the show are about as average as it can get. With the exception of Ginko, no one really looks remarkable. Some of them even fall under character archetypes such as Nozomi as the ‘glasses girl’. However, I’m more than pleased at the battle choreography of the show. Even from its first episodes, I knew it was impressive with the cinematic-like explosiveness. Some of the fights look like watching a movie by the amount of details it shows. I often had to take a breather or two after some of the fighting segments because it was that damn fierce.As part of Mizukami’s involvement in the show, he also worked on the series composition. This would be the first time anyone has heard of his work in animated form. And thankfully, he aces it with flying colors. In essence, the battle OST and music in the show is phenomenal. There’s not one moment in the battle scenes that loses momentum thanks to his talent. In my opinion, Mizukami gave those scenes a larger than life moment by the sheer technical quality of the soundtrack. It’s hardcore with heavy beats that mixes in with a variety of electrical notes to make everything flow together. On the other hand, I can’t really say the casting in the show were exceptional. Other than Sensei, everyone else just sounds too normal despite the show being abnormally strange. Luckily, the theme songs makes up more of that with their creativity.Planet With is not a show that I can easily recommend to just anyone. Watching the first episodes made my head spin at how complex the characters and the storytelling may become. And indeed, this series won’t be easy to watch with just an open mind. You need to understand the characters and their motivations as every action has a consequence. As surreal as the series feels, Planet With can be very enjoyable for once you accept for what it is. As Mizukami’s first anime project, I hope his manga works gets adaptations in the future. Or if not, make another season of Planet With because I want more. life.

Despite that, the show is still known for its various running gags such as Souya’s insatiable desire to eat meat. In general, I think the comedy in this show is a bit peculiar. It never relies on shock or fan service. Instead, it presents it in a sort of kooky and sarcastic way. The dialogues comes out naturally but sometimes mixes in silly words to make conversation flow like an oddball. Take it as you’d like but if this is your first time seeing a Mizukami work, then it should be an unique experience.There are many ways to describe the art style of Planet With but I find the word ‘surreal’ to be one of the more accurate representations. My first glance at the mecha designs immediately gave me a weird insight on its context. The ripple pattern eyes and cat-like ears is definitely an unusual design that I’ve not seen in many of the mecha series I’ve seen before. Furthermore, there are the Nebula that takes weirdness to another level such as the abnormal looking dolls or inverted babies. Oh and let’s not forget sensei with his idiosyncratic look. On the other hand, the human-looking characters in the show are about as average as it can get. With the exception of Ginko, no one really looks remarkable. Some of them even fall under character archetypes such as Nozomi as the ‘glasses girl’. However, I’m more than pleased at the battle choreography of the show. Even from its first episodes, I knew it was impressive with the cinematic-like explosiveness. Some of the fights look like watching a movie by the amount of details it shows. I often had to take a breather or two after some of the fighting segments because it was that damn fierce.As part of Mizukami’s involvement in the show, he also worked on the series composition. This would be the first time anyone has heard of his work in animated form. And thankfully, he aces it with flying colors. In essence, the battle OST and music in the show is phenomenal. There’s not one moment in the battle scenes that loses momentum thanks to his talent. In my opinion, Mizukami gave those scenes a larger than life moment by the sheer technical quality of the soundtrack. It’s hardcore with heavy beats that mixes in with a variety of electrical notes to make everything flow together. On the other hand, I can’t really say the casting in the show were exceptional. Other than Sensei, everyone else just sounds too normal despite the show being abnormally strange. Luckily, the theme songs makes up more of that with their creativity.Planet With is not a show that I can easily recommend to just anyone. Watching the first episodes made my head spin at how complex the characters and the storytelling may become. And indeed, this series won’t be easy to watch with just an open mind. You need to understand the characters and their motivations as every action has a consequence. As surreal as the series feels, Planet With can be very enjoyable for once you accept for what it is. As Mizukami’s first anime project, I hope his manga works gets adaptations in the future. Or if not, make another season of Planet With because I want more.', 'Planet With is an interesting series for a variety of reasons. Outside of the fact that it’s a super robot anime in our current time, its premise sounds almost as peculiar as the designs of the aliens at its disposal. A vengeful fight against a group of heroes ends up spiraling into a conflict about the nature of humanity, and whether subjugation or love is the best path for them. In a way, this plot progression sounds similar to super robot juggernaut, Gurren Lagann from the previous decade. It certainly isn’t as impactful or even as well-crafted, but the charm and overall writing are strong...enough to elevate this dark horse to its radar.First, we need to get an elephant out of the room; this show ain’t a looker. The CGI is generally terrible, making action scenes have no weight to them in terms of actual combat. This makes the combat feel floaty and even silly. The CGI works well when you see some absurd creature designs in the early episodes, but not for the mecha fights that are prevalent within the show, let alone any other machines that appear often. The character models are sometimes CG as well and they look even worse in those rare instances. That said, the designs are more than striking, from the mech and weird alien behemoth designs, to the wonderful, expressive, and/or sexy character designs. The actual animation and direction have some fun moments as well from interesting shots and angles, particularly later on. If only the CGI was up to par with the 2D elements, but alas JC Staff can’t help but continue its recent trend of lackluster visuals. To be fair, at least it stands out, unlike the music, which aside from the decent OP and ED, is serviceable at best.Where the show makes up for this is in its character exploration and chemistry. While few characters outside of Souya and Ginko are very memorable, the show does a wonderful job at exploring them and making their personalities bounce off each other. Most of the gags are spot-on, and despite how formulaic the early episodes were with some of its characters, what we got in terms of their backstories and how they dealt with everything was solid enough in its own right. Their conflicts, while spelled out to borderline obnoxious degrees, are handled in an engaging way, and the fact that this show works well as a modern surreal super robot shounen anime adds to this, right down to the finale. The show never indulges too far in its own bleakness despite how horrific several backstories can be and how the characters break down. All of this makes these characters charming for as unremarkable they may be. The comedy and romantic moments work effectively in that same vein. It never quite reaches Studio Gainax levels of maintaining that perfect balance between quirky, and downright tragic with shows like Gurren Lagann or Nadia. Despite this, well-respected mangaka Satoshi Mizukami still crafted arguably the most well-rounded show of the year. Cramming it all into 12 episodes as cleanly as it did is arguably one of the show’s greatest feats as well.Ultimately, this dark horse managed to be one one of the most surreal and charming shows of the year, visuals notwithstanding. Its conflicts are somewhat engaging, its feel is wonderful and genuine, and it manages to stand-out within this gigantic seasonal crowd for a variety of reasons. It’s a truly solid work with some real heart and talent to boot. Dare I say, with better action and CGI, this show could have been one of the greats. It certainly worked better as Gurren Lagann’s successor than Darling in the FranXX ever did. enough to elevate this dark horse to its radar.First, we need to get an elephant out of the room; this show ain’t a looker.

Going into the series itself is like taking the dive into something that you don\'t know how would it be like, even after the absurd leaps of event after event that STILL manages to keep you on-board and invested. It\'s like you can predict the plot, but then it changes shift so soon that you\'re caught unaware each and everytime. That\'s the magic of Satoshi Mizukami, the brainchild of this series that honestly, Planet With is so unorthodoxly planned with the result being of perfect balance, and it is criminally one of the most...overlooked gems of Summer 2018.Our main protagonist, Soya Kuroi, whom helms himself as a survivor of the once war-ravaged state that is Sirius, aims to do so many things at once (but with progression) which makes up for the bizarre but perfect plot. (Spoilers alert)1) He starts off his revenge against the people whom killed his parents in his childhood years, as this character that looks like the GOOD protagonist, but the disguise is that with the occupants, the gothic-looking Ginko (from planet Riel) and the cat-looking ""Sensei"" (which is Rashverak), he hides his appearance with the mask that is now reminiscent of when he\'s swallowed by Rashverak and transforms into the Nebula Soldier, a cat-like mecha. Going after the 7 members of Grand Paladin whom destroyed the UFOs in the shape of oddly-looking animals, not with their mech power, but psychological power (as the UFOs play their minds with disillusional good memories to defeat them), and then coming in as the de-facto to steal their power, a small jar containing stardust that enables them to transform to their mechs, which in turn acts as the catalyst for Soya\'s lost memories.2) The true plot of the series is now established, with Ginko explaining to Soya about the major difference: the fight for supremacy against factions - Soya\'s team being the Pacifist Faction, the people who want to change the world to be advocates of love, against the strange UFO weapons and Generalissimo the dog-looking general (which is Karellen)\'s team being the Sealing Faction, the strange creatures from space that wants to keep the world\'s status quo and seal the world from more harm and damage.3) As if this series hasn\'t been established yet (Mizukani\'s speciality of subversive plot),  Soya, after the whole Grand Paladin ordeal, now finds himself in a predictament as the ""People of Paradise"", the culmination of a projection of his brother, who went to fight against the Dragon (which is called Azrabarakura), who has destroyed the lands of both Soya and Ginko\'s homelands, comes back to him as the general purpose to tell Soya that the Dragon has been defeated, but NOT yet completely laid down to rest, and will awaken in 5 years (time leap to Episode 10). And with that, all Nebula occupants, which include both the Pacifist and Sealing Factions, combine their forces to seal the Dragon that has tormented the lands of past and rest its soul back with the ""People of Paradise"".The story premise starts off semi-promising, but by the time it reaches the climax, it is wholesomely satisfying and you will feel like all the constant world-building and build-up is made solely to captivate and eclipse every moment of the show. It\'s like a puzzle picture, every piece of the puzzle making up for its slots to form the whole picture.Speaking of the characters, every character design is Mizukani-based, and props to the production staff for keeping his designs on-point, because they all look impressive, have unique premises and overall, just a visual treat to look at. Even the mech designs are rich and great, for they don\'t look like anything else other than a brazen copy-and-paste method, and honestly it\'s quite a refreshment from the oh-so-many mecha shows we\'re used to, with Gurren Lagann being the speciality (and the mech designs there too ware so weird, it just works). This show also tries to slot in the humour that is soldered right into the plot, and that too works best in its own regard.And I ship Soya and Nozomi (the 5 years after time-leap), why does this become Side-B info? It isn\'t apparent, but then again this series vaguely shows (it isn\'t important to the overall picture anyways), so most likely both of them are friends and then comrades in the fight...and nothing else :(Once again, I was once unsure that J.C.Staff would be the best studio to take on what can be called the solid core foundation of Mizukani, since his works are unpredictable. But after watching this series in its entirety, I\'m contested and relieved that the production staff for this show really expresses their very best at creating the world that Mizukani envisioned everything to be. The art is not the greatest, but it works. The animation, especially the mecha-centric action scenes with the transformation to the battles with CGI, it was wonky at first, but the problems were quickly resolved with clean, concise and affluent animation. Some can tolerate the CGI at close range, but it\'s very noticeable and you be the judge of that.The music (heck and hell yeah) is Planet With\'s biggest win, because it not only explictly tells the story with the calm and soothing music at the low moments to the almost (slot in any superpower series you know)-feel BGM that holds the expectations ablaze with dubstep-esque bass, but also the music which is dope, which I have come to love the great purposefully made OST by Kouhei Tanaka (One Piece), and overall sound direction by Yoshikazu Iwanami (Berserk movies). The OP by Minami, \'One Unit\', doesn\'t disappoint (honestly coming in after High School DxD Hero) and is one of my favourites in the Summer season. Mai Fuchigami\'s \'Rainbow Planet\' for the ED isn\'t bad either, foreshadowing what all the characters has gone through the way in the series.And yet for all intensive purposes, Planet With falls ideally short of the fanbase, which is a shame to say the least (along with the MAL score), because it\'s a professionally-made show through and through. Thus far, this has been in the way, one of the most memorable series of the lackluster Summer 2018 season, and hopefully if you\'re like me, you don\'t know what this show\'s about but am intrigued by the storyline it has despite its shortcomings, pick this one up and prepare to be amazed. overlooked gems of Summer 2018.Our main protagonist, Soya Kuroi, whom helms himself as a survivor of the once war-ravaged state that is Sirius, aims to do so many things at once (but with progression) which makes up for the bizarre but perfect plot.

After watching the episodes up to this point, I was shocked to find it only had a 6.79 on MAL and was so low on Crunchyroll's anime listings. I'm not suggesting it's the greatest anime I've ever seen, but it's actually really well done.The premise is quite unique. It's initially confusing, but in a good way, a way that keeps you interested as they fill in the gaps and keeps you wanting to watch.The humor is great, and the way it's baked into...the plot is really well done, reminiscent of something like FLCL or Mob Psycho 100.The art is pretty good imo. I feel like the characters are expressive and all have unique aspects to them that really shows through in the art. And the CG stuff doesn't look bad. It's still clearly CG, but totally within tolerable range.Overall, I'm really enjoying this anime and I really think it deserve more attention than it's getting currently. the plot is really well done, reminiscent of something like FLCL or Mob Psycho 100.The art is pretty good imo.

Why do they fight? Because this alien dude really hates dragons.Other aliens teleport in the sky in forms of human insecurities and mental barriers and then explode and further turn into cotton after a short past story revealing something about the psychological side of our main antagonist humans occurs.Rest of this side...of the anime focuses around mecha fights where the mc pilots an alien cat and the humans use dragon powder to battle him because he is apparently the enemy of mankind even tho the fights are personal nakama revenging -tier nonsense... until the Fairy Tail effect hits among the nakama ranks and every upcoming twist is eventually the same as in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann except the opposite in quality. Or the same if you hate TTGL.The other half is slice of life school settings where people participate in club activities, read books and try to form some sort of interspecies romantic subplot that eventually starts looking like a harem of 3.

And whenever he fights, he comes up with random movements and yells out their names to a point that it mainly reminds me of that part in Naruto (shippuden) where he came up with 3 new types of rasengans in each episode. Moreover, this dude yells and yells and yells and yells to a point that it seems the only thing he can do is be loud and annoying.The entire characterization of the cast is so horrendous its hard to even gasp how Mizukami Satoshi spend 4 years writing this yet couldn\'t manage to make it any better than Psycho Staff (not to be confused with Psycho Pass).Major complains:The mental barriers is among the most interesting concepts in the work, yet it is being dealt with way too poorly. Appearance, past story, resolve, impact to present time = 6 minutes. Do much with little they say, yet what we get instead is the amount of information prioritized over how to present it. The pacing is ludicrous and makes all the problems seem exponentially worse.Our main character\'s memory loss is downright used as a mystery element in the series and its narration. Even when he experiences memory recollection, they aren\'t revealed to the viewer in the purpose of maintaining the illusion of suspense. It makes the whole thing cheaper.The main antagonists suffer from some highly obvious character flaws to a point that they reveal their faces in live tv. Even Lelouch in the idiocy that Code Geass was, was smart enough to use the zero mask to hide his identity. The entirety of the first half of the series would be impossible if the characters had any sense in hiding themselves. Even such shitty studios like Marvel and their ""superheroes"" are smarter than these fellas.One mystery gets solved. 3 seconds later --> New mysteries! The asspulled plot elements, near complete lack of foreshadowing and ""shocking"" twists that were used to create confrontation and some sort of ""witty wordplays"" are closer to being lame than anything else... Niichan! This is chaotic randomness and total nonsense to a point where it seems like zero fucks is given. I imagine the entirety of the story board was constructed by pulling new ideas from a hat. By hat, I mean that one meme where bunch of monkeys take a shit and the turds land on the words ""San Fransisco"", ""Disco Club"" and ""1971"" and then some clothes corporation prints that whole thing on a t-shirt. Except here we call it ""epic writing stuff"". Practically every single piece of writing in the latter half of the show is either deus ex machina or an asspull.The fights are.... yeah, example instead because what else can prove how awful they are:""I knew you weren\'t using your full powers!""*me inserting ""this isn\'t even my final form"" memes*>mc>yells>pray and spray>wins*me browsing more memes ""Bravo, Nolan""*^Some people think this anime is smart and epic, btw. All I am seeing is a collection of moviecirclejerk tier anti-quality memes. Speaking more about these memes, the appearance of Siriusian fleet is essentially Spanish inquisition and the love exist in other species an Interstellar ripoff. And the worst of them is the ""the power was inside you all along"" cliche which made me almost puke. If this was a self-aware parody, it would be amazing until it would turn so bad that it couldn\'t even be considered an excuse for comedy.One more: The dialogue.Mc: I see you\'re the type who uses his muscles instead of brains.Also mc: *screams and smashes buttons angrily*Unintentional comedy/5Art:The mecha side for mc was highly inspired by/lend from TTGL like so many other things.The backgrounds are brilliant and pretty look at. The animation is often awkward. Especially robot movements which are relying on CGI.The character design captures Mizukami\'s style perfectly and all the anomalies in the series are rather original and well-planned.Sounds:Did this thing really have music in it? Can\'t recall.  Other than the mc who yells more during 12 episodes than Black Clover mc during the entire series, the sounds are forgettable.Conclusion:Absolute disaster of an anime beautified with ideas and concepts that offered enormous potential yet end up being enormously nothing. Countless anime series seem better than before thanks to them not being this anime.When I say Planet With is bad, I don\'t mean any half-asset, zero-effort ""bad"",I mean the real die-hard bad stuff that wouldn\'t be able exist without a mastermind who was able to ruin every trace of quality in them. Planet With is not shallow, superficial bad, it is complex, deep, in-depth bad.This series will be remembered as an example that manga writer shouldn\'t try to make millions of compromises just to make their series fit the animated medium. Hoshi no Samidare and Spirits Circle could never work in the anime format and now I pray no one ever tries to adapt them.Planet With\'s biggest achievement is working as an advertisement for the mangaka\'s other works, but as far as entertainment goes, it certainly did its job by offering an anime that was much more fun to watch than it was good in terms of anything. Mainly because it was so bad that the difference between quality and enjoyment grew larger. If you thought this series is as bad as I did, consider giving Mizukami\'s manga a try nevertheless because those are great.I really wanted to praise this because I have read Hoshi no Samidare 4 times and it\'s in generally among the reasons why I am into the animanga industry in the first place, but Planet With doesn\'t deserve positive praise. Its merits are almost entirely limited to how awful it is.tldr-Story 1/10 It\'s rare for writing to reach this level of pathetic. Shows that impress with its lack of quality in this manner don\'t happen very often. In fact, I am surprised this wasn\'t written by the guy who did Guilty Crown and Code Geass. To make it clear as possible: I have been utterly impressed by how badly written this thing is.-Characters 2/10 Yelling, yelling, yelling. Even Hand Shaker\'s cast had more charm, and this isn\'t even meant as an insult.-Art 7/10 Really liking the art, tho.-Sounds 5/10 Lots of yelling but not much more.-Enjoyment 5/10 I enjoy bad anime often and consistently for their comedic value. This one was such advanced awfulness that it momentarily managed to even annoy me.-Total 2/10 This thing is close to unwatchable. I don\'t see how this thing could appear to be any better unless watched completely half-assedly in the background, casually or even ironically. Personally, I couldn\'t do this out of the respect I hold towards the author. of the anime focuses around mecha fights where the mc pilots an alien cat and the humans use dragon powder to battle him because he is apparently the enemy of mankind even tho the fights are personal nakama revenging -tier nonsense... until the Fairy Tail effect hits among the nakama ranks and every upcoming twist is eventually the same as in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann except the opposite in quality.

The pacing is ludicrous and makes all the problems seem exponentially worse.Our main character\'s memory loss is downright used as a mystery element in the series and its narration. Even when he experiences memory recollection, they aren\'t revealed to the viewer in the purpose of maintaining the illusion of suspense. It makes the whole thing cheaper.The main antagonists suffer from some highly obvious character flaws to a point that they reveal their faces in live tv. Even Lelouch in the idiocy that Code Geass was, was smart enough to use the zero mask to hide his identity. The entirety of the first half of the series would be impossible if the characters had any sense in hiding themselves. Even such shitty studios like Marvel and their ""superheroes"" are smarter than these fellas.One mystery gets solved. 3 seconds later --> New mysteries! The asspulled plot elements, near complete lack of foreshadowing and ""shocking"" twists that were used to create confrontation and some sort of ""witty wordplays"" are closer to being lame than anything else... Niichan! This is chaotic randomness and total nonsense to a point where it seems like zero fucks is given. I imagine the entirety of the story board was constructed by pulling new ideas from a hat. By hat, I mean that one meme where bunch of monkeys take a shit and the turds land on the words ""San Fransisco"", ""Disco Club"" and ""1971"" and then some clothes corporation prints that whole thing on a t-shirt. Except here we call it ""epic writing stuff"". Practically every single piece of writing in the latter half of the show is either deus ex machina or an asspull.The fights are.... yeah, example instead because what else can prove how awful they are:""I knew you weren\'t using your full powers!""*me inserting ""this isn\'t even my final form"" memes*>mc>yells>pray and spray>wins*me browsing more memes ""Bravo, Nolan""*^Some people think this anime is smart and epic, btw. All I am seeing is a collection of moviecirclejerk tier anti-quality memes. Speaking more about these memes, the appearance of Siriusian fleet is essentially Spanish inquisition and the love exist in other species an Interstellar ripoff. And the worst of them is the ""the power was inside you all along"" cliche which made me almost puke. If this was a self-aware parody, it would be amazing until it would turn so bad that it couldn\'t even be considered an excuse for comedy.One more: The dialogue.Mc: I see you\'re the type who uses his muscles instead of brains.Also mc: *screams and smashes buttons angrily*Unintentional comedy/5Art:The mecha side for mc was highly inspired by/lend from TTGL like so many other things.The backgrounds are brilliant and pretty look at. The animation is often awkward. Especially robot movements which are relying on CGI.The character design captures Mizukami\'s style perfectly and all the anomalies in the series are rather original and well-planned.Sounds:Did this thing really have music in it? Can\'t recall.  Other than the mc who yells more during 12 episodes than Black Clover mc during the entire series, the sounds are forgettable.Conclusion:Absolute disaster of an anime beautified with ideas and concepts that offered enormous potential yet end up being enormously nothing. Countless anime series seem better than before thanks to them not being this anime.When I say Planet With is bad, I don\'t mean any half-asset, zero-effort ""bad"",I mean the real die-hard bad stuff that wouldn\'t be able exist without a mastermind who was able to ruin every trace of quality in them. Planet With is not shallow, superficial bad, it is complex, deep, in-depth bad.This series will be remembered as an example that manga writer shouldn\'t try to make millions of compromises just to make their series fit the animated medium. Hoshi no Samidare and Spirits Circle could never work in the anime format and now I pray no one ever tries to adapt them.Planet With\'s biggest achievement is working as an advertisement for the mangaka\'s other works, but as far as entertainment goes, it certainly did its job by offering an anime that was much more fun to watch than it was good in terms of anything. Mainly because it was so bad that the difference between quality and enjoyment grew larger. If you thought this series is as bad as I did, consider giving Mizukami\'s manga a try nevertheless because those are great.I really wanted to praise this because I have read Hoshi no Samidare 4 times and it\'s in generally among the reasons why I am into the animanga industry in the first place, but Planet With doesn\'t deserve positive praise. Its merits are almost entirely limited to how awful it is.tldr-Story 1/10 It\'s rare for writing to reach this level of pathetic. Shows that impress with its lack of quality in this manner don\'t happen very often. In fact, I am surprised this wasn\'t written by the guy who did Guilty Crown and Code Geass. To make it clear as possible: I have been utterly impressed by how badly written this thing is.-Characters 2/10 Yelling, yelling, yelling. Even Hand Shaker\'s cast had more charm, and this isn\'t even meant as an insult.-Art 7/10 Really liking the art, tho.-Sounds 5/10 Lots of yelling but not much more.-Enjoyment 5/10 I enjoy bad anime often and consistently for their comedic value. This one was such advanced awfulness that it momentarily managed to even annoy me.-Total 2/10 This thing is close to unwatchable. I don\'t see how this thing could appear to be any better unless watched completely half-assedly in the background, casually or even ironically. Personally, I couldn\'t do this out of the respect I hold towards the author.', 'This is definitely going to be the overlooked gem of the season. Written by Mizukami Satoshi, the mastermind behind ""Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer"" and ""Spirit Circle"", some of the greatest manga written in the past decade, his style of writing the absurd shines through in this anime. With sound direction done by Iwanami Yoshikazu, who did sound direction for the Berserk movies, every attack has a satisfying sound of metal on metal with it. Planet With is the type of anime that people will drop quickly due to A. it\'s absurdity and B. it\'s lack of immediate explanation, but I plead people to not...abandon ship to soon and miss out on another amazing story from Mizukami. abandon ship to soon and miss out on another amazing story from Mizukami.', 'One of the worst anime in this season in my opinion. Feels like a show made for young children below 12 years old-Has no interesting story-Unlikable character that look and behave like children. There is not a single character that I like, and they all look so horrible.-Action in this show is so stupid. The enemies and robots looks so stupid and has same design as anime made for children.With a lot of good action show in this season (like attack on titan 3, overlord 3, Sirius the Jaeger, Banana fish) there no reason to waste your time on this trash.  I would...even say Isekai anime (like Isekai Maou to Shoukan and Hyakuren no Haou) have better action than this show, and you get to watch some good looking girls as bonus. even say Isekai anime (like Isekai Maou to Shoukan and Hyakuren no Haou) have better action than this show, and you get to watch some good looking girls as bonus.', 'Let me preface this by saying, this show is not for everyone. This is the type of show that doesn\'t hold your hand through anything. It throws you in there, and through context clues and light exposition, as well as experience, it leaves it up to you whether you understand it or not. However, that doesn\'t mean that it makes it intentionally difficult to understand the plot, because it gives you just enough to make you understand, without overstepping its bounds. Story 10/10I wanna point out probably this show\'s best aspects. The unique way it tells a story, and the INCREDIBLE sound design. I already...explained its story telling in my first paragraph so let me point out the sound design. This was made by the same genius behind JoJo, and you can tell. The sounds of the mechas clashing, the sounds of the spaceships and monsters that are almost defeaning, THE SOUNDTRACK OH MY GOD. It\'s fantastic. Sound 10/10But of course, this show isn\'t perfect, so let\'s get into what people probably point out the most when looking at this show, and that\'s the CGI. I have to admit the CGI was a bit jarring to me when I watched it as well, however, I wouldn\'t exactly say it\'s bad either. It\'s decent CGI, that flows well, and matches its setting well. I will say that I got used to the CGI after a few episodes so I guess that\'s a positive. Art 8/10As for the characters in this show. Yeah... there are a lot of them, and not a lot of them feel fleshed out. Granted, this is because this show is only 6 episode in as of the moment of me writing this, so there could be development coming. Each of the 7 heroes have their ""thing"" and for the most part they portray it very well. My favorites have to be Nezuya, a lame high school graduate who constantly does JoJo poses, and the old  man, the head\'s father and certified anime old dude. Then we move on to the more significant characters, those being Takashi, Kuroi, Ginko, and Neko-sensei. I think they are all pretty good characters, besides Ginko, she feels very one note. However, the rest are REALLY fascinating characters. Takashi, the man who seems to be the main villain, has very strong ideals, and wants to bring peace to humanity using force. On the other hand, we have Kuroi, the main character. A young boy whose planet was destroyed  by an idealist like Takashi, and wishes to get revenge, and prevent the same thing happening to earth. The good character are really good, while the not so good characters don\'t really stand out much. Character is a 7/10 for me, at least so far.Overall, I am really enjoying my time with this show, but I feel that I can\'t really recommend it to everyone. It\'s a show for people with very specific taste. If you like watching anime that challenge you to think more about what you\'re watching, then I definitely recommend this. If you want blind, thoughtless mecha funtime, then this is not for you.

It\'s Satoshi Mizukami\'s first venture into anime, and if you\'re familiar with his manga, its what you would expect him to do if he had only 1 cour to work with.Planet With has fairly juvenile aesthetics sometimes, and other times has a flashy, brilliant style reminiscent of Star Driver, it honestly in many respects resembles that sort of general ""no explicit deaths"" thing Star Driver had going on. A lot of the time it is just a genuinely good comedy. But underneath that childish, absurd looking surface, Planet With is really, really,...deep.The metaphors and philosophies at play are not necessarily accessible, and I don\'t see people try and tackle them in fiction often, but Planet With is very much an exploration of important, fundamental philosophies that move as titans through our real world. Issues of acceptable use of force, the ultimate fate of mankind\'s capacity for violence, trust in society, dealing with your lessers, etc. are really quite core to the plot.There are probably only a couple of things I would change about Planet With if given the chance, there is something almost magical about this configuration. The show moves VERY QUICKLY, even more so than would be expected for trying to cram a grand story arc into a single cour, and while this is offputting to some, it\'s a breath of fresh air for me. Something that could easily be the penultimate episode of any other show happens EVERY WEEK. I am genuinely excited to see each new episode, something that very few anime crack these days. The OP and the ED are the only really excellent audio in the show, but they certainly do their job of getting me pumped. deep.The metaphors and philosophies at play are not necessarily accessible, and I don\'t see people try and tackle them in fiction often, but Planet With is very much an exploration of important, fundamental philosophies that move as titans through our real world.

Now this is a very mixed bag but the elements are presented in such a way that none of it is forced and it all fits together. There is also some decent humor. Lastly it has a very fitting conclusion. However, the twelve episode count is clearly limiting for the creator and this means we do not get to see his best. Development is inevitably rushed at points and the story as a whole cannot reach the heights that it probably could have if the author was...given more to work with.ART 7.5/10The art style is similar to the style Satoshi Mizukami uses in his manga and personally I like it a lot. No excessive fan-service, characters are varied in their designs and the settings are nice. While not mind-blowing (cf. Flip Flappers, OPM or Mob Psycho 100) the animation is good and I would give a 8/10 except for the CGI. While the CGI is for the most part quite tolerable and only really seen in the mecha battles, it is the only criticism I have of the show and the reason is that it does not suit the design of one character. To me CGI works well for geometrical shapes but one of the designs is highly organic and this throws you off a little bit. I think if that one design was changed then CGI wouldn't even be an issue. Alternatively they could have changed that design or even hand drawn it.SOUND & MUSIC 7/10The voice acting is great, which is almost a given with anime at t this point, and the sound effects are on point. Now the soundtrack isn't one of the soundtracks that you would find yourself buying just to listen to (cf. Ping Pong The Animation or Devilman Crybaby) it is decent and the music fits the scenes well.CHARACTERS 9/10The single best part of this show.Satoshi Mizukami doesn't do cliches and there are no simplistic good and bad characters and characters have well reasoned motivations for their actions. The cast is also quite large but not too large and not a single character is tagged on. They all fit in the story very nicely. Once again the episode count is limiting, but this is one area where the creators skills shine through at almost 100 percent. The only reason it doesnt get a perfect ten out of ten is that the story will inevitably impact the characters and as mentioned earlier the story is limited by the episode countENJOYMENT 8/10The show is thoroughly enjoyable since it never drags, avoids cliches and finishes off well. Most of all just seeing the character interactions is very enjoyable, and while this is not meant to be the main draw, it does turn out to be the case.OVERALL 8/10This is the first anime series that Satoshi Mizukami has been a part of. He is best known for three manga, namely1 Lucifer and the biscuit hammer--> https://myanimelist.net/manga/10552/Hoshi_no_Samidare2 Sengoku Youko --> https://myanimelist.net/manga/8070/Sengoku_Youko3 Spirit Circle --> https://myanimelist.net/manga/38071/Spirit_CircleTo be blunt, all three are masterpieces as far as I am concerned and to see him finally get an anime is something I looked forward to as soon as Planet With was announced.As an author I think he is one of the very best, if not the best, at wrapping up his stories in a satisfying manner and we see this same skill come through with Planet With. In conclusion the anime is a great one cour show that finishes well but ultimately fails to live up to the creators full potential. Here is hoping his other works get a top tier adaptation.

No harm in wishing..."", ""Norio Wakamoto plays a talking dog.apparently the review has to be longer than that. I don't see why. I mean, I could tell you that the script, written by manga legend Satoshi Mizukami, is one of the tightest, most intricate and compelling pieces of writing I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I could tell you they brought on jojo's sound designer, who does a stellar job of making the big robots feel like big robots.I could gush forever about this show's many virtues, and I have in other formats.But Norio Wakamoto plays a talking dog, and that really ought to be enough to convince...you to drop everything and watch this. you to drop everything and watch this."", 'One of the oddest trends I observed over the course of this year’s summer season was that out of all the seemingly lackluster offerings on the charts, the two anime that were getting the most overwhelming praise were also the two anime that, according to MAL stats, nobody seemed to be actually watching: Revue Starlight and Planet With, aka the New Age version of Utena and Gurren Lagann. I plan to get to Starlight in time, perhaps when I feel it’s time to bite the bullet and finally get an H-Dive account. Until then, though, we have Planet With, a bizarre little show from a...bizarre little writer that got so many superlatives slung its way over the course of its run, with everyone from Mother’s Basement to Digibro singing its praises, that it was almost comical. So, after finally checking it out several months after the fact, was the end result worth all the gushing?Well, the first thing to note is that Planet With is very, very weird, and it’s not afraid about flaunting that fact early and often. Our protagonist, high schooler Soya Kuroi, lives with a green-haired maid named Ginko and a mildly perverse living Lucky Cat statue named Sensei who communicates entirely through single-syllable cat noises. Soya has lost his memories of who he used to be, but he’s content just living with this odd family and dreaming about tasty, tasty meat. That all changes when a massive alien spaceship that looks like a toy you’d find in Sid from Toy Story’s room appears on the horizon, its intent unknown, and Soya is called into action by his family. Without getting to into spoilers for a narrative where the slow-burn reveal of the importance of every puzzle piece is a big part of the draw, Soya’s new “family” is part of Nebula, an interstellar organization dedicated to the observation of the evolution of other races. And at the moment, they’re in the middle of an internal rift: one faction believes they should “seal” populations before they evolve enough to wield catastrophically dangerous power, while the faction Soya’s drafted into believes they should let people evolve and guide them on the right path to use that evolution responsibly- for love, as they put it. Thus, Soya finds himself reluctantly thrust into the position of Nebula Warrior, fighting against a wide array of foes with various agendas and desires of the Earth and its people, all while grappling with the scars his own hidden connections to this conflict have left on him.So yes, just from that plot synopsis, it’s clear that this show has an utterly bonkers streak. In a way, I feel like it’s potentially too creatively unfocused for its own good at times; aesthetically, the whole production is an utter nightmare of mismatched styles, blocky animalistic aliens and sleek human designs with the majority of the battles taking place between angular CG mechas. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s an eyesore, but it takes a while for all the disparate visual elements to feel like part of the same whole, especially with how low-res some of the more digital textures end up being in the show’s back half. I do think that the CG elements, while clearly a concession to budget concerns, acquit themselves admirably most of the time, by virtue of actually embracing the unique properties of their medium and moving with full fluidity over anime’s usual “imitate the limited movement style of 2D anime and end up looking like a buffering cutscene” approach. There’s a great sense of weight to the mech battles; larger machines have longer wind-ups, there’s momentum in every step, and the sound design is heavy and bass-y to capture the overwhelming, sometimes almost painful, cacophony such massive creations would naturally create in the course of grinding up against each other in combat. But in the first couple episodes, there’s definitely a sense of disconnect, like you’re watching this story play out from behind a pane of glass, more observing the oddities of the visuals and off-kilter humor than truly connecting with it.Thankfully, it doesn’t take long for this curious appreciation to start melting into something truer and more honest. Because as bizarre as the story is, the further along it goes, the more you realize that it’s actually going to stick the goddamn landing with what it’s trying to accomplish. I’ve heard this show described as Gurren Lagann in half the episodes, and without getting into specifics, that really does capture its overall feel, starting small and continuously escalating to greater and greater height of spectacle, with the small-scale story of Soya growing into a man at its core. And it’s there that Planet With truly shines; for all its bizarre elements, the beating heart at its center is unmistakably human. The show grapples with weighty ideas of evolution, love, revenge, forgiveness, responsibility, family, and so much more, wrapping so many ideas into its small runtime that it’s honestly amazing the show never feels overstuffed. And it ties them all back to its expansive cast of characters, all of whom are wonderfully memorable from the instant they appear on screen and draw ever closer to your heart the more you learn about them. It really does pack two cours worth of development, growth, and adventure into a single cours run, making efficient use of every second so as to not sacrifice depth for conciseness.Because believe it or not, when this show tips its hand and reveals its overall game plan, it’s actually remarkably profound. There are hard choices to make, hard questions to ask, hard obstacles to overcome and hard truths to accept. There’s a genuine darkness to some of the places Planet With goes; Soya’s ongoing struggle with the scars of his past grows increasingly gut-wrenching the more you find out about it, and the emotional turmoil he puts himself through as he tries to sort out how to process that pain leads to some moments that hit me in places I didn’t expect to be hit. Yet even in that darkness, this is a show about hope, about people coming together in the face of crises, about everything we have the potential to become if we fight for it, about the power that love and forgiveness can hold in response to overwhelming darkness, and about how even in the most hopeless situations, you are never alone. I got really damn close to crying at several points in this show’s back half; that’s how potent its ethos is. Sure, these kinds of stories are a dime a dozen in anime, yet it’s not too often you see them executed with this level of care, intimacy, and subtlety. Yes, I just called the show with the intergalactic mute furry subtle. Believe it or not, the title fits.Perhaps if the show were a little more consistent, with a cleaner production and a stronger handle on its discordant aesthetics, we would have a genuine masterpiece on our hands. As stands though, if you missed out on this one back in summer as I did, now would be the time to fix that. Don’t let the odd CG fool you; Planet With is a real winner, with creativity to spare and an inspiring, achingly human heart. bizarre little writer that got so many superlatives slung its way over the course of its run, with everyone from Mother’s Basement to Digibro singing its praises, that it was almost comical.

There’s a genuine darkness to some of the places Planet With goes; Soya’s ongoing struggle with the scars of his past grows increasingly gut-wrenching the more you find out about it, and the emotional turmoil he puts himself through as he tries to sort out how to process that pain leads to some moments that hit me in places I didn’t expect to be hit. Yet even in that darkness, this is a show about hope, about people coming together in the face of crises, about everything we have the potential to become if we fight for it, about the power that love and forgiveness can hold in response to overwhelming darkness, and about how even in the most hopeless situations, you are never alone. I got really damn close to crying at several points in this show’s back half; that’s how potent its ethos is. Sure, these kinds of stories are a dime a dozen in anime, yet it’s not too often you see them executed with this level of care, intimacy, and subtlety. Yes, I just called the show with the intergalactic mute furry subtle. Believe it or not, the title fits.Perhaps if the show were a little more consistent, with a cleaner production and a stronger handle on its discordant aesthetics, we would have a genuine masterpiece on our hands. As stands though, if you missed out on this one back in summer as I did, now would be the time to fix that. Don’t let the odd CG fool you; Planet With is a real winner, with creativity to spare and an inspiring, achingly human heart.', ""This show is a well-oiled machine. In only 12 episodes it managed to develop its themes and tell the whole story without feeling rushed. Truly a miracle for a 12 episode anime. And to put the cherry on top, this show has several plot twists and still manages to keep up the consistency.The fluidity of the CG was also impressive. I was paying close attention and I didn't notice any points where it got choppy and ugly like it does in most CG shows. The mechs, especially the protagonist's, also have a layer of polish to them. The only CG that looked kinda bad was...the dragon, which looked like it was taken from a GameCube game (still very fluid though).The soundtrack was also good, it gave the fights the epic backdrop they needed for me to get immersed. The opening also gets a pass. While the soundtrack is good, I still feel there's work to be done if it's going to be as good as the soundtracks from other greats like Gurren Lagann.My main issue is that there really isn't much time for the characters to get fleshed out since it the series is so short and fast. There was enough development to serve the narrative, sure, but not enough to get attached to any of characters besides the protagonist. If this were a two cour I feel my score would be better since the large cast would have more of an opportunity to leave an impression on me.Another issue I had is that I feel like it was too... normal? It does all the normal mecha tropes well, but at the same time I think years from now there won't be much for me to remember this for besides being competently executed. If I was left with the feeling that this show was more unique, my score also would have been higher.So that's Planet With, a 7/10 show. Coming from me that's actually a pretty good score, at least compared to other people who'd throw out a 7 without a second thought. I'd recommend it to anyone since since its overall execution was very consistent, but for the reasons I've explained earlier I wouldn't expect them to think it's going to be their favorite or anything. the dragon, which looked like it was taken from a GameCube game (still very fluid though).The soundtrack was also good, it gave the fights the epic backdrop they needed for me to get immersed.

That\'s why I initially skipped over it.Story:If I had to liken the story I would to a hand of poker. You get a 10 and a 2, junk right? But as the Flop, River and Turn comes in it develops into a full house. Does it beat everything? No. Will it win most hands absolutely. Planet With took from a seemingly garbage start and developed into a full story leaving you invested into the characters and the narrative. Plus the ending will likely leave you with a wholesome face wide grin.Art:It\'s OK. The initial shock of...the character design gives you the impression of something weird, and it is. But other than that nothing really stands out in terms of art. I will give credit to CGI the mechs for looking nice in fights.Sound:It did the job. The OP and ED were always skips from me but the sound design did it\'s job. Doesn\'t take away from the show but it doesn\'t have that UMPF that a great soundtrack does.Characters:Superficially they all seem week stereotypes but where this show shines is how we in such a short time get to see what they believe. We understand these characters and why they do what they do. It\'s all to often we see ""I\'m EVIL because I""M EVIL"" but Planet With\'s characters left me caring and invested with them.Overall/ Enjoyment:These two are combined because they\'re the same thing. The show left we with a wide grin and thoroughly curious of what was coming next.  The way to show tied itself together and ended I feel satisfied in a way many shows fail to do.If you enjoy Mecha or are just looking for a show that tells a complete story i would wholly recommend Planet With. the character design gives you the impression of something weird, and it is.

That fact begins to change one day when his town is attacked by one of the mysterious Nebula weapons. Together with the cat-like ""sensei"" and her friend GinkoSouya gets dragged into a fight against seven suoerheroes who protect the town. It is a simple but well developed story that shares resemblance to some of the greatest series of the genre and does a pretty good job of paying tribute to it\'s predecessors.The art is consistent through the entire run, it is colorful and makes a great impression in the eyes of the audience that way letting itself be liked and enjoyed, the robots action scenes make use of cgi in some occasions but it doesn\'t deny or derail any of the consistent output in the tecnical department, it isn\'t the best use of chi to have been seen but it is quite well made and fine in it\'s own way.The music is also an excellent part and one that actually helped the show achieve it\'s potential, the way they orchestrated every piece and every sound from the most emotional song to the least noticeable subtle laugh.Every part of the sound aspect is well directed and used for the best of the show in order to help it highlight it\'s advantages even more and make them able to be presented in a way that the audience can actually knowledge.The characters are interesting enough to be able to keep the audience attention. Kuroi Ginko is an excellent assistant to the protagonist in the way that she is able to help him to see the most advantegous movements to make, ""sensei"" is a comycal character that is actually serious enough to serve as the power source of Souya and eventhough the rest of the cast wasn\'t that interesting they served their purpouse.One of the parts that i enjoyed the most of this show is the way the relationship between the protagonist of the story Kuroi Souya and Tamagahara Nozomi is handled through the story, it feels as if it grows along with you as the episodes pile up and the time invested in watching the show keeps gaining minutes and hours. The relationship\'s development just feels real in a way that shares a resemblance to the way real life relationships actually work and that makes it one of the very best aspects of the show.The series had some flaws that kept it from being a masterpiece such as the way some characters were handled wasn\'t clear enough because they didn\'t showed what was their objective or goal and some narrative scenes didn\'t made much sense within the story. Apart from that it was great in all it\'s aspects showing how good a well done mecha show can be.This show deserves to be praised and liked by anyone that is able to enjoy truly well done mecha series and is able to differentiate an actually good one from one that really isn\'t. to improve the overall quality of the genre.The story revolves around Kuroi Souya, a highschooler living a seemingly peaceful life despite having no memories of his past.

My personal thinking about this anime is pretty good too watch because there are a little romance, action, mecha fights and like the protagonist is a pretty stubborn type but a good person.Short Story -In this anime, the protagonist kinda lost this planet and his surrounded everyone including his big brother. Well about the planet since this anime story is totally sci-fi type. However, he was saved by a space police or guardian commander and by the princess of the planet who was the protagonist\'s planet\'s opponent, during when the evil dragon...was destroying everything. [For detail story please watch the anime, since I don\'t wanna spoil the fun of this anime by giving the details, just making highlight where I get the fun of the anime.] Then they brought the protagonist on Earth and most likely in the first he was not able to remember about himself that who he might be. Then there he found a cute girl in the school he admitted, who usually care for him. Then slowly those two become friend, beside that there was a team who was fighting against the space police with that crime dragon power so the protagonist got to help them because they somehow become his new family. The protagonist was not actually wanted to harm them just taking their power source and then he usually left. Then slowly goes on advance fighting another space police arrived who wanted to seal the Earth because they were using the power which could be a danger as they were thinking. The protagonist makes them believe that Earth people won\'t do the same mistake that his planet people did, actually he was asking not to direct seal like an unfair way just give a chance. Well after that evil dragon came back and everyone together fought with him at the last for saving everyone the protagonist and that two person who saved his life together sacrifice them and got sealed away into space-time hole. They somehow escaped from there and the protagonist, after all, landed his own planet where into the lifeless ocean he found a small power. Then other people able to find them and there ""Happy Ending"".The most of it I like the part where The protagonist didn\'t hesitate much to save someone else. I like bravery things.

[Thanks for the anime. and Thanks for reading my review]', ""Fair warning: there are some spoilers in this, but they’re not really anything huge. If you watch this show and anything of what I say ruins it for you then DM me and I’ll probably tell you to man up.Synopsis for Planet With makes it sound kind of like generic trash so I’m happy to say that it’s anything but. A lot of people noticed this anime thanks to recognizing the original creator but I never really came across his work to get where excitement is coming from. Nonetheless when you see a battle start and the enemy “mech” looks like a giant plushie with...ears for arms, a bunch of hands sticking out the bottom and nose on the back, you might realize that this is somewhat unusual and it keeps going from that.In terms of narrative PW starts out deceptively basic, but in actually it’s very carefully laid out and executed, even if it shows some blemishes now and then. The centerpiece of it is Soya, a kid with amnesia living in a house with a maid and a giant cat. Although he himself seems normal, his dreams and flashbacks reveal that there’s more than meets the eye. Soya is in fact the last survivor of his alien race which was destroyed by the dragon from one of those dreams.Then, suddenly, out of absolutely nowhere his totally normal life is interrupted when his roommates tell him that he has to take out the superheroes that are fighting a giant invading alien plush. He’s reluctant at first but after he senses a connection between those superheroes or mech pilots and the dragon, his mission shifts towards personal revenge.Anyone who has seen a few anime can already imagine what the rest of the plot will look like. Luckily enough Planet With throughout the run keeps subverting expectations and keeping things from being predictable in a sensible way that doesn’t feel like writer just wanted to play a cheap “gotcha” on the viewer. Instead of stretching things too thin, everything goes at a brisk pace, to a point where episode 6 feels like it would’ve been finale in any other show. Time skip near the end doesn’t serve as an excuse to shove in some pointless SoL and just because our hero has 7 enemies doesn’t mean that he has to fight all 7 of them or that they even want to.This is probably a good time to bring up the characters. While once again there’s nothing too deep in this, PW manages to fit in some very nice and emotional character stories within the episodes that help you feel more sympathy for them and relate just a bit more. The main way in which it’s done is trough forced dreams/comas inflicted on people by the aliens. In those dreams people usually get to accomplish whatever they couldn't do in real life or erase a tragic event. You dog died? It’s alive and happy in this dream. You’re poor and sick? In the dream you’re rich and healthy.These dreams capture people in comfortable delusions and whichever superhero takes down the next huge alien thing has get through rejecting those fantasies much like humanity itself at one point has to reject it to move to progress instead of becoming dull and complacent. Some might think this is too emotionally manipulative but I found the show to be so genuine in the way it treats this topic, that instead of complaining about cheap tricks it almost got me to tear up.Emotion is important part of this show and might be a make or break for some people. With how prevalent both drama and comedy are, your enjoyment will likely hinge on your sense of humor and how much you’re willing to get attached to the characters. Personally, I had no issues, because as simple the characters are, it’s very easy to relate to their problems and sympathize with their struggles. Comedy too, was fresh and inventive, occasionally making fun of itself and the genre while still presenting some cliches with love and understanding of what people love about them.This praise stops when you get to visuals. I wouldn’t call Planet With outright ugly but it’s very, very rare for it to do anything noteworthy with the visuals. Main mechs look nice and designs for big alien things are pretty cool and memorable but same can’t be said for the characters. It’s not even that they look bad but they’re terribly plain. They wear pretty bland clothes with dull color palettes and usually don’t have anything distinct going on with their head which ends up making them look like background characters.Going back to mechs, those don’t look great a lot of the time either but not because of their design but thanks to some pretty low CG quality. While I commend them for not trying to imitate framerate of 2D drawings and making 3D actually look smooth, there’s still a very noticeable lack in detail that makes CG somewhat jarring nonetheless.When that happens I wish the quality of action would compensate for the weak visuals, but for the most part it doesn’t. There’s some sick finishing moves throughout the show but actual fighting is really underwhelming. From special move spam to zooming in so far away that characters become splashes of color smacking into each other and leaving a faint trail behind them. There’s not much here to excite and it’s a really bad thing when large part of the anime revolves around fighting. Some of this is offset by the emotional impact of those scenes but emotions aren't everything.Directing is similarly not that impressive. There’s a few good shots sprinkled throughout and pacing is good but other than that it’s too average to really comment on. That includes music, hardly much time passed since I finished the show but I can’t even recall a single track from it or its usage. It’s about as distinct and memorable as stock OSTs in some generic VNs. At least there’s some pretty nice and juicy sound effects here that make impacts feel really heavy when they need to be.Despite ending on a sour note I think this anime is a lot of fun but probably won’t appeal to the most picky viewers. If you’re a fan of mechs or shonen or can just tolerate some of the flaws however, you’ll probably have a good time. ears for arms, a bunch of hands sticking out the bottom and nose on the back, you might realize that this is somewhat unusual and it keeps going from that.In terms of narrative PW starts out deceptively basic, but in actually it’s very carefully laid out and executed, even if it shows some blemishes now and then.

As long as it sticks the ending, I'll probably end up going back to this over Gurren most of the time, cause it's just that good.It is quirky as hell, and the art style reflects this. For me, this is a plus, but understandable how it might not be everyone's cup of tea. The CG is well done. Not Land of the Lustrous, but it's quite good, and helps sell the more absurd and fantastical elements.Was surprised by the depth and...development it gives even the side characters, and the mains are great.

Hope you\'ve learned your lesson!Jokes aside, though, it\'s not Mizukami\'s greatest work—not by a long shot. But nevertheless it\'s a solid, competently-made series that manages...to showcase quite a few original ideas, goofy humor and clever storytelling moments despite evidently playing too much with stale genre tropes and specific title references—to the point where the show actually starts playing them out in earnest. Maybe it was a conscious decision made to appeal to a wider audience—I don\'t know. I just didn\'t appreciate it very much as it made Planet With feel like the authors weren\'t sure it could\'ve made it without obvious crutches. Mizukami\'s other works are incredible exactly because of how unique they are, and at any moment you feel like you\'re about to experience a genre cliche, they go and subvert your expectations without fail. There are maybe a dozen other storytellers of this caliber currently active in the entire industry, give the man some respect he deserves!One more thing to note about the show is that the abundant use of very apparent CGI, thankfully, is kept stylistically coherent and unintrusive, so it actually looks rather nice and fluid. Together with the very wide dynamic range sound effects (so when something explodes, it gives off a really satisfying ""BOOM"") they make the action scenes a pretty powerful, visceral experience despite the lack of complex choreography.Finally, the fact that Planet With\'s rating has climbed up by over 0.5 points since the premiere clearly indicates that people are warming up to it and gives me hope that other, arguably better Mizukami\'s works are adapted at some point. If you\'ve found any sort of enjoyment in this anime, please do yourself a favor and read Spirit Circle, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, and Sengoku Youko. You can thank me later. :p to showcase quite a few original ideas, goofy humor and clever storytelling moments despite evidently playing too much with stale genre tropes and specific title references—to the point where the show actually starts playing them out in earnest.

BUT it never loses focus once in the show. Thankfully the major events are structured in such a way that is really streamlined and easy to follow thanks to a very strong cause-effect story. The story also never really lets itself get bogged down with exposition dumps which is an insane feat given how much ground the show covers. Backstories and characters are well fleshed out and the dialogue always gets to...some major point either with its characters or the major plot whichever plot it was covering. Speaking of plot that\'s one of the big selling points to me.The overall narrative of Planet With stays largely the same: Soya figuring out who he is and what he needs to do. While vague there are threads of this point made through each of the ""arcs"" of the show. Planet With never rests for a moment and is constantly setting things up to be typical only to throw them away and move onto the next thing it wants to focus on. This show is basically the personification of a story that has ADD and I really dug it. The voice acting was about average for most modern anime, the animation and design were actually really well done and visually were one my favorite things about the show. Now onto the music, OH BOY the music. It bangs, short and simple every bit of music from the OP to the ED and especially any of the combat scenes are all pretty top notch in my opinion. Overall the story can get a little complicated but its a really fun time some major point either with its characters or the major plot whichever plot it was covering. Speaking of plot that\'s one of the big selling points to me.The overall narrative of Planet With stays largely the same: Soya figuring out who he is and what he needs to do. While vague there are threads of this point made through each of the ""arcs"" of the show. Planet With never rests for a moment and is constantly setting things up to be typical only to throw them away and move onto the next thing it wants to focus on.

This show is good. It\'s really good. AOTY contender for sure. While I can\'t say this with the utmost confidence, as it stands it is the best thing I have watched this year. Planet With manages to be an incredibly witty, smart shonen/sci-fi/mecha anime that perfectly encapsulates boyish fun and adventure.Kuroi, although looking like an average boy. Is actually an intergalactic race of alien that got destroyed by a dragon(?), because his human-like species got their planet destroyed wholesale for...embracing their worse war-hungry, power seeking tendencies. Kuroi the last survivor of not only his loved ones but also his own race has been traumatically scarred and is on a quest for revenge. Seeking to defeat anyone who contains the ""power of the dragon"" by fighting with a giant cat and a princess... Yeah, this show is strange, and as a viewer, you should know that upfront.Generally, the first thing that you will notice about Planet With is the pacing. It\'s fast; the mangaka is confident in his ability to create conclusions for the plot points he creates. All of the conflict in this show( Kuroi\'s resentment and lust for revenge, his double life, etc.) all get resolved in a timely manner. You can pretty much think of this show as the antithesis of something like DBZ insofar as every fight scene instead of being accompanied by episodes and episodes of pointlessness are followed instead by a swift resolution that tumbles straight to the next plot point.Planet With\'s mangaka is a prolific man. Working on a ton of series and even receiving some acclaim in his career. His experience with storytelling and worldbuilding shows in this work. It shows that he has found his corner of the market and continually is honing his ability to speak to said audience. The tone of his jokes, his quirky understated humor and appreciation for shonen tropes without teetering on the edge of cliche, for the most part, is something I admire.As good as the show is it drops the ball by being another shonen battle, action adventure - albeit a very smart one. There are very few unneeded recaps, character motivations out the A, betrayal, and switching factions. My main problem with this series and the basis for why I didn\'t score this higher is due to the fact that it could have stood to do and say more. It could have served to be a pretty clever deconstruction but instead, it is content with being just a slightly above average shonen.The side characters and their initial development are interesting elements of the story in their own respect are nothing to write home about. The characters don\'t feel robust or three dimensional, and could even be written off as one note. Each and every side character has about an episode or less developing them because that is all the time a 12 episode series can afford to spend on each of them individually.At the end of the day, what is more, to say? To repeat myself - it\'s good. I was just a little disappointed to learn that it\'s just a shonen/mecha repackaged and served up in an interesting, appetizing way embracing their worse war-hungry, power seeking tendencies.

The end cannot justify the mean if the mean itself is full of plot hole and tangling mess. On the other hand, we have Planet With, which is a properly executed mecha anime comparing...to the former. The two stories share a lot in common, the premise of defending the earth from certain enemy, the plot of certain \'third-party\' enemy appears halfway through, to name a few. However, Planet With knows what need to be focused instead of getting a bit of everything half-cooked.Story: 7/10To be fair, the story of Planet With is not anything outstanding but I don\'t blame them for that, in the end, it is just another mecha show in the sea of shows belonged to the genre. At the very least, I like the message they want to deliver. It is not a show about old fashion good vs evil, you don\'t even know who are your allies and enemies during most of the screen time. Every force has their own idealogy, motives, and objectives that does make some senses. You just follow what you think is right and your today ally might become enemy tomorrow. That is way more interesting than having certain good guys for the entire show for no better reason than just because they are good. The only downside is the beginning is quite shaky since we can easily feel confused about where the anime want to progress and what we should and should not pay attention. Still they clear the confusion soon enough and maintain a proper pacing through out the rest of the show, nothing seems rushed.Art: 9/10I am not a fan of mecha show so I can\'t compare much to some classics. However, I think the design of the mechs are pretty well done. The CGI effects feel so damn ""real"" and lively, even to the point that I think the design of the characters are a bit underwhelming comparing to the mechs.Sound: 9/10I don\'t think the OP and ED are on par with some of the top this season, but they are not bad either. However, what makes me grade so high for the sound is the soundtrack and the sound effect especially during the battle. Just put your headphone on, turn the volume up a bit and we can hardly know if the sound comes from some Hollywood movies or just a mech anime. It sounds just damn good, the explosion, charging is rich and fulfilling. The impact sound is also brilliantly created.Character: 6/10Character is actually the biggest weak points of this anime considering a promising story. Our MC is, Soya, just undoubtedly a straight flat boring typical MC one can found in many anime. At least it doesn\'t pathetically employed ecchi to attract more audience than necessary (if any), which is a good thing. Sensei, how to say it, there is not much to say about this ""cat"", it just said Meow almost the entire show, at least it is funny to translate that word in a 3 paragraph full of words. But the point is, you won\'t be able to know much about many important characters of the show. The only one I can clearly see a strong characteristic is the Dragon.Still the show is entertaining and enjoyable. If you are a fan of mecha show then definitely check it out. to the former.

It's absolutely in my top five favorite anime of all time, and i even made an account on here specifically to review the series because it's that good. I don't normally like shows in the mecha genre, but this is an exception. The story is brilliant, the characters are great, the entire show is amazing.The only real problems i have with the series are that the cgi is kinda bad, but not enough to really detract from my enjoyment of the series, and the battle sounds can be a bit loud relative to the music and dialogue sometimes, but other...than that, it's amazing.This is the kind of show i would recommend to anyone, no matter what kind of shows they like. Give it a try. than that, it's amazing.This is the kind of show i would recommend to anyone, no matter what kind of shows they like. Give it a try."", ""With a name like Planet With it's hard to know what to expect, and after watching it it would still be a hassle to give a plot description that doesn't sound like the ramblings of a madman. Certain elements of the plot seem very derivative of other works. The “aliens wanting to stop dangerous human evolution” plot point is very similar to the Anti-Spirals from Gurren Lagann. Whether that was intentional or just a product of good old anime tropes I don't know, but I think Planet With has enough originality and quirks to make it worth a watch.The main character, Soya Kuroi, is a...little spitfire but becomes more restrained as the series progresses. His character arc is decent, nothing amazing but adequate. I really liked the cat vs. dog motif with the Pacifist faction and Sensei vs. the Sealing faction with the Generalissimo. Despite their simple designs, those two were my favorite characters for their humor and themes. Ginko, the maid who lives with Sensei and Soya, is a cute character, especially her voice. Unfortunately, she doesn't have much of a character arc and her backstory is brief, but there's only 12 episodes. The Grand Paladin members all have a little backstory to have their motives explained but they seem to get less important as the series progresses. One of the issues of this anime is that the story is ambitious for a show that is only 12 episodes long, so the pacing is very fast. From a viewing standpoint this is amazing as it means constant action with little filler, the downside being that characters are left undeveloped, plot points come very quickly with little digestion time and some of the battles feel very rushed. In the end, the show is entertaining enough that these are only minor gripes.The animation isn't bad. During my viewing I didn't notice any areas where the 2D animation seemed lacking. The mechs are CG and have original looking designs, though personally I'm not a huge fan of most of the mech designs outside of a couple of them. The CG is a little iffy, especially on the dragon. He looks like he came straight out of a PS2 game. Ginko is very cute but most of the character designs aren't anything to write home about. The designs of Sensei, the Generalissimo, and the sealing devices are very amusing and enjoyable.Plot-wise, this show has a lot going for it. From the beginning, you don't really know who the heroes or the villains are, what the characters’ motives are, and not much is explained right away. It grips you and makes you want to keep watching and each episode unravels a little bit more of the mystery of all of this. You feel as if you are learning about everything alongside Soya. It would have been easy to make Grand Paladin the protagonists, but I like that the conflict is approached from a different angle, where they are seemingly the antagonists at the beginning. Having the dragon identified as the main antagonist early on was a good move, because it could have easily become an asspull at the end. Though some may not like the fact that it feels as if the antagonists are always shifting, I think the overall plot structure works. As stated previously, there’s only so much to be done with a story this ambitious in a 12 episode anime. It definitely could have been longer, but you’re getting 12 engaging episodes with no filler, so I can’t really complain.This one is rough around the edges in a few places but I was thoroughly entertained for its entire duration and I think it’s definitely worth your time. It’s got a little bit of everything, and with only 12 episodes it’s not a heavy investment at all.

Long, dumb attack names? Life lessons? The supernatural? Some good ol friendship? One of these or none of these probably came to mind when you think of ‘anime.’ These tropes provide us as viewers with a sense of familiarity when checking out something and to recognize something in just a couple seconds from trope savviness. When there is an overuse of tropes, it can lead to something formulaic, boring, and having no pulse. But, playing around with tropes can lead to some unexpected results; catching the audience off-guard to stay entertaining...and engaging. It can create something new, yet, familiar. And takes you on journey with teenagers, mechs, magic, long dumb attack names, the supernatural, and even some life lessons. That journey is Planet With!If we’re talking about the looks of the characters, they look like they’re from the 2000’s. Which gives the show its unique look; the more cartoony style is just right for the shounen-like story ahead. The show uses a wonderful variety of colors throughout many areas of the show. The colors are able to present a natural division of the heroes and villains with Nebula having darker colors and Paladin having lighter and neutral colors. The dream sequences have a large bloom effect to make everything seem artificial and the magic effects have all sorts of colors to make it seem otherworldly and powerful. It would be wrong of me if I never brought up the CGI the show uses because its used a lot. Personally, I think it looks just fine. The variety in mech designs, being based off of animals, make them stand from other humanoid mecha; plus it moves pretty fluidly during the action sequences, which makes it all the more impressive. While the show has variety of elements thrown into its presentation, I can say this for certain: Planet With is visually consistent.The characters become very well developed; which is shocking given the shows runtime! Each character has a definable personality from the start and as the story goes we begin to learn more about them. A majority of the characters’ depth comes from their backstories, so we understand their goals and drive towards decisions; and through the sealing devices we get to see their dreams, what they really want if they could have it. Not all the characters get a backstory or dream sequence but instead make it up with their strong personality and the entire cast overall is very entertaining.If you want to make ‘psychokinetic mega-god photon armor’ sound powerful there is only one way to do it: MAKE IT SO LOUD IT CLIPS! Yoshikazu Iwanami is known for his loud sound effects and audio clipping and it’s used to wonderful effect here. It allows the mechs to give off more of an ‘umph’ in their attacks due to the CG models not really showing any damage unless they need to; plus it definitely makes up for the lack great animation in the show. The wonderful orchestral soundtrack gives the series of grandeur to its in its Sci-fi universe. Able to go blood pumping symphonies to emotional melodies; the score has a lot of range and is a great listen on its own.Living in the now, not in the past; is an overarching theme that encompasses Planet With, and serves as the heart of its story. Many characters have regrets and emotional baggage and are given a glimpse into a wonderful dream, an alternate look into a life where the pain they went through never happened. But, that’s not how life works. It has its up and downs, it’s unpredictable, it can take and give away at any moment. It’s only through the give and takes of life that we can grow up and become the people who we are today, stronger and experienced. And this message is carried through in a story with no brakes. The pacing is phenomenal, every scene serves some sort of purpose to create one of the most efficient stories in recent years. A story that is able to be super fulfilling within 12 episodes that many other shows fail to accomplish in longer runtimes is a statement to its quality!Twisting the audiences’ expectations without making them feel betrayed is a testament to Planet With’s quality. Entertaining and weird as hell with little need for questioning; it just makes sense. Somehow looks decent despite the different mediums the show uses. And knows just what to do to keep you invested.

I can\'t really talk about them without spoilers, but I enjoyed the supporting cast members as well.The animation is fantastic.

All the robots are CGI too, but they actually have some good shots and some action scenes are pretty good but in general it doesn't work as well as it could.The story isn't bad, actually it has a few surprises...and it's structure allows to unveil it slowly but it feels childish and without tension. There is a nice message about forgiveness but it's taken too far, the extent is taken to makes it seem absurd and stupid. It's events don't have the weight that they should have to tell a story like this correctly.The characters are ok, there isn't much to say about them.

Pumpkin Scissors,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1538/Pumpkin_Scissors,"[""This is absolutely typical.  Oooh, I thought, something about a post-war relief squad.  That has some real potential, it's original, good setting, chance for some great stories, those shots look nice, and - Oh nuts, it's Gonzo.Studio Gonzo have this amazing effect; I suspect they have some kind of quota system in effect.  For each really good thing they put out, there seem to be a bunch of things about which you end up thinking &quot;if only they'd just done that differently, that could've been so much better...&quot;.  Every excellent series like Bokurano that they put out is outnumbered by flawed...or downright shoddy fare like Strike Witches, Full Metal Panic and Chrno Crusade - and most often, the problem with Gonzo series is the story. Pumpkin Scissors is, sadly, not among the excellent exceptions, but part of the quota-filling compensation.One thing that's hard to fault Gonzo on, by and large, is their art; true to form, Pumpkin Scissors is pretty good looking generally, with its well-realised and highly atmospheric post-war setting.   Animation, while not exceptional, is uniformly fluid throughout, and high in production values.  Its fictional war-ravaged state very much resembles post-WWII Europe in temporal setting, appearance and level of technology, and visually, it is credible and detailed. Having a small military unit as its main cast, there's lots of military paraphernalia around too, and mechanical design and animation is very good, appropriate to the period and highly credible.  Military uniforms are also well designed and seem believable, while the ornate clothing of various nobles also seems fairly well designed, if sometimes a little risque for the women considering the setting and the series' audience (possibly; more on this later).  Character design absolutely screams Gonzo; that's not necessarily bad, but in this case only the male lead, Cpl. Randal Oland, really stands out as memorable, visually, and that's mostly due to his resemblance to Frankenstein's monster.Otherwise, characters are perfectly serviceable but by and large nothing amazing or charismatic - and that goes for both appearance and actual characterisation.  The central cast are Lt. Alice Malvin, a manically enthusiastic, verbosely idealistic and stupendously irritating noblewoman who serves as Pumpkin Scissors' officer in the field, Hunks, the terminally laid-back old guy who is her boss, the rest of the unit comprising Oreldo, a serial ladies man, Lili and Mercury, a mascot-type girl and messenger dog pairing, and Martis, a quiet, nothing sort of guy with no notable qualities other than wearing glasses without a bridge.  Add the hulking yet timid and pacifistic newcomer Cpl. Oland as a main protagonist and that's Imperial Army, State Section 3, Pumpkin Scissors Division.  Except!  Oland has this Special blue lantern, which is Special because it's a relic from his Mysterious Past, and when he turns it on, he becomes nigh on invincible.  Sound like a familiar idea?  Certainly it does, just like all the characters, who are, frankly, a bunch of one-dimensional stereotypes who seem worn after barely an episode and barely develop across the whole series' run.Now, with a theme and setting like this, even bearing such characters in mind, you might expect some fairly serious, complicated, grown-up sorts of stories.  You might also expect that, with 24 episodes to play with, some kind of overarching plot might develop.  And you would be right - in a way.  However, here, the curse of Gonzo falls on Pumpkin Scissors  hardest.  I am forced to wonder if, at some stage in development, the powers that be suddenly decided to dramatically decrease the age-range at which this series was aimed; out goes the violence, out goes the complexity, out goes any scope for grittiness or ambiguity in keeping with the setting, and instead, in come the stereotypes, the boundless, unceasing optimism and the chirpy ending theme.  For all its laudable efforts to tell serious, grown-up stories and ask serious, grown-up questions, the series cannot help but be heavy-handedly moralistic, predictable and universally pedestrian and preachy in tone and approach.  Despite being armed soldiers, and contrary to what Lt. Malvin's incessant shortsword-waving might suggest, it's extremely rare that any of our heroes actually hurts anyone, let alone kills them, however hard their opponent is trying to kill them; not even when seven foot Darth Maul-style swords enter the picture is anyone actually harmed.   It somehow always falls on Oland and the Specialness his lantern grants him to simply soak up the damage long enough for the bad man to be arrested by everyone else, the end.  Worse, every time anything like an ethical question arises, it's always dealt with in starkly black and white terms that completely conflict with the setting; if ever there was a setting in which the morality of almost every action is shrouded in uncertainty and ambiguity, this is it.  The Pumpkin Scissors unit, however, always does the right thing, and can always tell what the right thing to do is, and never, for example, has Malvin's unyielding idealism cause something dreadful to happen.  It's spineless storytelling, the kind common in substandard things designed for kids, and the series suffers from it.Most calamitous of all is the pacing.  Episodes plod, by and large, with lots of unnecessary exposition and little by way of progression.  Generally, most stories take only one or two episodes to conclude, with the effect that each fiendish, cut-and-dried plot by the evil noble to defraud the commoners out of what they rightfully deserve, essentially the thrust of all these mini-arcs, becomes the Monster Of The Week (or fortnight).  It takes a long time for the main plot to develop into any more than a vague concept hanging around in the background, and development from then on is glacially slow - too slow, in fact, for it to actually come remotely close to a resolution by the end of the series.  And what an end - never have I seen such an artificially stretched batch of episodes.  Events that should take two episodes at best in fact take six; what occurs covers half, maybe three quarters of an hour of real time, stretches to over two hours in practice, and in the end, gives nobody any answers or resolutions anyway.  No, the series carefully creates links between almost every incident Pumpkin Scissors have hitherto been involved in, weaves in an enigmatic antagonist that works behind the scenes to orchestrate these incidents - and ends.  Worst of all, it does so twice; as well as not actually providing any end to the actual plot, it creates a huge anticlimax by slowly, piece by piece, revealing the truth behind Oland's Mysterious Past, then doing virtually nothing significant with it.Even the music is disappointing.  You could have all sorts of evocative, classy music in here - some classical or classical-based pieces, maybe, or some soulful folktune-based stuff.  However, most of the background music is brassy and march-like or otherwise military themed, and adopts a peculiarly stiff, simplistic flavour of waltz for scenes dealing with the nobility.  The opening theme is brash and not much cop, and the ending theme is completely inappropriate in its hyper, overhappy energy and nonsense lyrics.So yes, this is one of Gonzo's lamentable also-rans.  It's not impossible to enjoy, provided you expect little of it, but I'd find it very hard to want to watch any of it again.  The fact of the matter is, you just can't help but think of Pumpkin Scissors as something that might have been so much better, if only...  If only they'd decided whether this was for kids or for adults...  If only they'd finished the storyline...  If only the relentless optimism didn't grate so much against the setting...  If only it had left some room for ethical ambiguity...  If only it had somehow managed to dig up some characters with charisma and some motivations that worked in more than one dimension...  If only it didn't wait until the tenth episode before it explained its amazingly contrived and silly name...

A cease fire has ended between Royal Empire and the Republic of Frost. Three years later the Empire is still plagued by problems from the war, soldiers becoming mercanieries, starvation, and disease. To help solve the problems the Empire sets up Imperial Army Section III nicknamed Pumpkin Scissors. Led by 2nd Lieutenant Alice L. Malvin and a special forces soldier Randel Oland set out to change the empire.Almost everything about this anime was great. The story wasn't original,...but had a good twist to the usual stuff. The characters were interesting. The animation was done by Gonzo, and was great. The music was ok. Now you're asking why if I thought it was great, why did I just give it 7. That's because it's story was to broad and ended to soon. It was a 24 episode anime, but the story could have covered 48 episodes. The story was really open ended even for anime, the characters had some developments, but should have gone deeper. I am really hopping there will be another season. but had a good twist to the usual stuff. The characters were interesting. The animation was done by Gonzo, and was great. The music was ok.

I have to say, even I was skeptical at first and had a hard time picking up the manga, or the anime to watch or read it. But once I got started, I couldn't stop. It has a subpurb plotline, and the characters are VERY believable, it's almost like you mourn for them when something bad happens. It's very realalisting even besides the fact that they have a litle bit of fantasy genre in there. The fantasy genre was so beutifully mixed into the reality that it...was hard to tell witch was witch. Of course if your looking for something outright fantasy, this wouldn't be for you. But if you have a compassionate heart, I'm sure the main character, Randel Oland, will take a place in your heart, and the story will inspire you to do something in your life. Very touching. The story is about cleaning up the war, but I only hoped it wouldn't be dreadfully sad. (like one of those anime you can only watch an episode at a time) but it wasn't. It's one that has a great balance, and kudos to the creator,  Ryoutarou Iwanaga. Even though the second character Alice L Malvin looks like your typical shounen girl character, Iwanaga defies the odds, and makes her just as unique as you and me. In fact, Iwanaga makes ALL the characters unique. (hm, well machs is kind of lacking, but still) I hope they come out with a second season too. It's one of those shows that you can ABSOLUTLY NOT wait for the next season to come out, and if you could, make it come out faster; or rather, right now. ^^ I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. was hard to tell witch was witch.

Malvin, a ragtag outfit of inexperienced yet well-intentioned military officers aspire to forge a positive, lasting impact in their community, their society, and the world at large through resolving one trivial, small-scale case after another. They are Section 3 (nicknamed the “Pumpkin Scissors” unit) of the Royal Empire militia; brought into existence by the Empire’s ceasefire with a rivaling country after a long, arduous, bloody, and pointless war, this unit, the archetypal “whipping boys” of the military, contributes in combating the after-effects of the...war (of which there are many) through relief efforts. Pumpkin Scissors is an anime that primarily follows the journey of Section 3, quietly observing as they navigate through increasingly deadly circumstances; along the way, it has (unfairly) attracted comparisons to a far more renowned work, that being Hiromu Arakawa’s Fullmetal Alchemist. Both titles are focused on post-World War I Europe from the perspective of the army but that is where all similarities end. Where Fullmetal Alchemist is entrenched in the fantastical, Pumpkin Scissors is more realistic. Where Fullmetal Alchemist strives for grand statements and a wide-reaching vision, Pumpkin Scissors instead advocates for a subtler approach. This is a show that catapults its’ viewpoints to the forefront through deceptively simple character interactions in a way that’s neither overbearing nor patronizing. Each and every character, from Oreldo (Section 3’s most laid-back officer) to a brothel owner, from the slimiest of aristocrats to a tutor of a princess, from the disposable mooks to the struggling mother of a newborn girl, and (of course) the great Lt. Alice L. Malvin, is given an opportunity to express their opinions, to critique various societal ills, and to offer suggestions on how to improve our world. At its core, Pumpkin Scissors is quite the intellectually engaging show, one that expects you to ponder, reflect on, and even question what’s being presented to you. However, it also understands that it can enjoy itself at the same time and, as a result, this show makes for one memorable experience.When the military is mentioned in casual conversations, one’s mind naturally associates this term with excessive self-discipline, with rigid formations, with polished weaponry, with hours of marching, with screaming sergeants, and with gaudy displays of patriotism. Pumpkin Scissors’ central cast, however, sharply contrasts with the traditional perception of the military. Known for not taking themselves seriously, Section 3 wholeheartedly embraces an easygoing mindset and, for the most part, so does Pumpkin Scissors. Each assignment that’s designated to Section 3 is a joy for the soldiers to carry out and entertaining for the viewer to watch. In the hands of another show, standalones ranging from a package delivery to a missing baby would have amounted to a stiff, unengaging watch. Pumpkin Scissors, however, is special in its ability to transform the flimsiest of ideas, the most mundane of concepts, into something memorable. Its success in this area is due in large part to a mastery of observational humor; in other words, Pumpkin Scissors creates enjoyable experiences from ordinary circumstances by highlighting the comedic potential in them. Whether it’s by inserting sexual innuendos in unusual situations or subverting expectations with outlandish ideas, Pumpkin Scissors ensures its audience will never tire of its material. Of course, one cannot discuss this show’s humor without mentioning Oreldo and Lili. While Oreldo provides the aforementioned innuendos, alongside snarky one-liners and a solid character arc, Lili brings to the table a starkly different sense of humor. Her style of comedy is more physical than anything else but it’s also endearingly childish; Lili’s ability to coerce the rest of Section 3 into singing innocent chants alongside her never fails to put a smile on my face, and the same can be said for episode 18, which is the day in the spotlight that Lili more than deserved to have. By bringing together Oreldo’s deadpan charm and Lili’s whimsical nature, Pumpkin Scissors has two different forms of comic relief in its arsenal. That it’s capable and willing to utilize both is why its’ standalones are among this show’s greatest assets.And yet, Pumpkin Scissors’ assortment of zany adventures are not merely self-contained stories; rather, they are all individual entities that are strung together by an overarching goal. Yes, the episodes, at least the earlier ones, are more than a little cartoonish but they all strive to examine isolated aspects of 1930s Europe, to zero in on the ailments of this society, and to present solutions to them. This show prides itself in its efforts to maintain a clear, unbiased outlook on its subject matter, and that pride is certainly warranted. On one end is the homeless, the desperate, the despondent, and the distraught. On the opposite end is the wealthy, completely unaware and unconcerned with the struggles of others. And in the middle is Pumpkin Scissors, lending an ear to both sides while arguing for a world in which equality reigns supreme. This show is one that offers its perspective to a multitude of topics, including gender equality, human rights, and the futility of war, but, at its core, it is a social commentary on classism. That Pumpkin Scissors would choose the 1930s-era Europe as the setting in which to present this issue is fitting because one would argue that at no point in history was the socioeconomic divide as prevalent as it was in the Great Depression.In 1930, Austria and the United Kingdom, among others, abandoned using the “gold standard” as a monetary system; it was predicated on the value and quantity of gold, and because entire countries discontinued this system, it was a clear indication of gold’s worth. That, of course, was only the beginning. Banks began closing left and right, specifically Vienna’s Creditanstalt bank in 1931, which caused a massive economic uproar. By 1932, the value of the European trade had plummeted to a third of what it was in 1929. Everyone at the time was reeling from the Great Depression’s effects; the difference between the one percent and the majority was that the former was able to maintain a resemblance of their wealth while the latter lacked the luxuries to do so. In bleak times such as the 1930s, everyone wanted, no, needed to hear proposals to build a better society, one that wouldn’t lead to another Great Depression. Pumpkin Scissors’ perspective is one that’s worth looking into because its ideals are not only relevant to the time period it covers but they are applicable to our current society.Through the assignments that Section 3 undertake, Pumpkin Scissors lands one opportunity after another to convey its message. Through each episode, more and more insight is offered into its subject matter. At first, the situations that are presented and Section 3’s solutions to them appear as black-and-white concepts, as symbolic of good and evil. Initially, the lower-class citizens are portrayed in the most positive light possible - in fact, one would argue that Pumpkin Scissors’ earliest episodes are essentially love letters to the working class - while the aristocrats are depicted as merciless monsters, lacking any empathy or concern for their fellow humans. This perspective, the glorification of the average joe and the demonization of the patrician, is hardly unique to Pumpkin Scissors (it’s extremely prevalent in our current environment and has been for years) but what makes this show special is its’ ability to transform this perspective into a narrative device. The members of Section 3, disillusioned with the socioeconomic structure, have developed a firm confidence in this perspective; interacting with corrupt nobles and humble commoners only serves to strengthen their beliefs. However, when Section 3 confronts more powerful obstacles later in the series, their way of thinking changes for the better. Pumpkin Scissors exposes the more sinister members of the working class, they with vile and opportunistic motives, alongside a more humanizing portrayal of the wealthy (specifically with Marquis Paul) for Section 3 and the viewers to see; at the same time, it presents its’ central message and its solution to classism: the only way that our society will ever improve is if we stop discriminating each other based on socioeconomic standings and encourage open discussions on how we can help each other. One might think this proposal is too idealistic - I, for one, certainly do - but what matters is that Pumpkin Scissors never states its claims as ultimate truths. What it values are ideas, plans that will change our communities for the better, and it seeks to influence its audience in formulating said ideas. Time after time, the conflicts that Section 3 are involved in are only resolved when both sides are willing to discuss their opinions, to respect the beliefs of those they disagree with, to discover similarities, and to reconcile with differences. Now, you might be tempted to think along the lines of “What happens if someone is unwilling to compromise or if they’re too stubborn to discuss a resolution with Section 3?”. Well, my friend, that’s where Randal Oland comes in.Oland is Pumpkin Scissors’ protagonist and, while he doesn’t leave the strongest initial impression with viewers, it’s only when he’s utilized as a plot device that his potential as a character is fully realized. Don’t get me wrong; I like Oland. Mild-mannered and soft-spoken yet assertive when necessary, he’s a gentle giant that values the other members of Section 3 above all else. Oland’s a decent guy (my favorite memory of him is when, in a particularly touching scene, he prevents an injured and unemployed factory worker from killing himself) but, at the same time, he’s more than a little shallow and one-dimensional.. initially, at least. At various points in the show, there are times when Section 3 cannot resolve issues through normal means and it’s in these situations where Oland abandons his “nice guy” role. You know he means business when he flicks on that lantern he always carries. Illuminated by the ominous mist that emanates from his lantern, Oland, with the glazed, unhinged stare of a zombie and his infamous handgun (the “Door Knocker”), demolishes any overwhelming obstacle that Section 3 encounters, whether it be a tank or a squadron of trained killers, in an expedient fashion. Anytime the show’s writers find themselves in a dicey scenario, it’s Oland that almost always bails them out; he’s a walking deus ex machina. While it would be convenient for Pumpkin Scissors to leave this matter as is, Oland’s moments of invincibility are highlighted by the devastating after-effects that spawn from them.Once upon a time, there was a mysterious division of the Royal Empire militia that was discontinued because of how ruthless its members were. This division was known as the “Invisible Nine” and Oland was among them. The scenes where he is forced to employ what he acquired from his “Invisible Nine” days are among Pumpkin Scissors’ most memorable moments. A Gregorian chorus screams in the background and the skies blacken as Oland’s Door Knocker wreaks havoc on all it comes in contact with. He slowly trudges toward his target, entirely unfazed by the bullets that decorate his body, as bystanders cannot resist gazing in horror. It’s understandable; after all, these scenes are frightening spectacles unlike any other. All of a sudden, it’s over. The Gregorian chorus fades into nothingness, the skies brighten, and Pumpkin Scissors resumes its regularly scheduled programming. As for Oland, he’s not as fortunate. See, when he activates his lantern, Oland’s not exactly invulnerable; his zombified state temporarily numbs the pain of whatever injury is inflicted on him so when he’s done destroying everything, any damage he absorbed along the way affects his body when he reverts to normal. Sure, Oland can automatically overpower any opponent he faces but that doesn’t amount to much when he has to be hospitalized immediately afterwards. Every fight that Oland involves himself in are accompanied by a collection of gruesome injuries and more than a few mental scars. Not only does he have to confront an inferiority complex (created because he feels he contributes nothing to Section 3 other than his wanton acts of destruction) but he also has to battle his PTSD (he’s reminded of his “Invisible Nine” days and the people he killed anytime he’s forced to use his lantern) and then there’s the thought in the back of his mind that he cannot resist mulling over. There are times when Oland imagines a day in which he’s forced to activate his lantern but is too frightened of the after-effects to go through with it, in which his overreliance on the lantern ends up destroying him. It’s when Pumpkin Scissors becomes a more serious show that Oland’s deepest, darkest fear morphs into a reality.In a two-parter involving the kidnapping of Lt. Alice L. Malvin, the flaws of Section 3 emerge for all to see and the same can be said for Pumpkin Scissors itself. Our protagonists commit severe errors in judgment and the effects of these errors are colossal. For the first time ever (and not the last), Oland’s Door Knocker isn’t enough to save the day; he can barely defend himself, let alone fight, when a powerful assailant attacks him. Finally, the members of Section 3 fail in the protecting the lives of innocent civilians, also a first. This two-parter is the initial showing of this show’s potential, a vivid glimpse into what it can (and eventually does) accomplish later. With that, one would expect the succeeding episode to amplify the morbid atmosphere of the two-parter, to develop Oland’s inferiority complex, and to (at the very least) investigate into who Oland’s attacker works for (you know, what the show has been hinting about since its earliest episodes).One would be incorrect.Apparently, some big shot on the Pumpkin Scissors staff gave the aforementioned two-parter a hard look, observing the vilest corners of the human heart, the monstrosities of the Royal Empire, and the intensely emotional core of it all, and declared “For the next episode, I want a silly love story between Section 3’s most worthless member and a character nobody will ever see again. Yep; I really think this is an ideal fit for the narrative and tone of the series”. Episode 13 is not only a phenomenal waste of your time (the less said about Martis, his paper-thin characterization, and his relationship with a prepubescent girl, the better) but it’s also indicative of a bigger issue I have with Pumpkin Scissors, at least early on. I will trumpet its’ virtues from the highest rooftops if necessary but I cannot reconcile with the earlier episodes’ habit of slinking away from taking itself seriously. Time after time, whenever Pumpkin Scissors’ early episodes encounter anything that deviates from its fun-loving nature, there is a immediate shift in the other direction. Thankfully, it abandoned this habit as time progressed and Pumpkin Scissors is better because of it.Even when the flaws of the earlier episodes are overlooked, there are a handful of shortcoming that some observers would opt for criticizing. While Pumpkin Scissors is quite the impressive show plot-wise, it flounders aesthetically. The background art is stiff, the color palette uninspired, and the CGI appalling; given that Studio Gonzo produced this show, it’s understandable that the CGI is as jarring as it is but the same cannot be said for the soundtrack. While the music is far from terrible, it’s not much to write home about, either. These shortcomings aren’t exactly flashing red lights; they aren’t severe enough to turn away potential viewers but at the same time, people actively looking for things to criticize, that only watch a show to attempt discovering what’s wrong with it, will immediately point to Pumpkin Scissors’ aesthetics and judge the entire show because of it.Thank God, then, that it has 2nd Lt. Alice L. Malvin.Alice is the sort of character that can make any viewing experience worthwhile; by any measure, she’s a show-stealer of the highest caliber. However, judging from what other critics have written about her, one wouldn’t exactly walk away with a positive impression of her. In the eyes of these critics, only the most rudimentary elements of Alice’s character are visible so they condemn her without dedicating any time to familiarizing themselves with her. According to them, Alice is nothing more than a nuisance, a pacifist that doesn’t advocate for her beliefs as much as she screams for them, and they dismiss her entirely because of this. Perhaps it’s because they (and anime viewers in general) feel uncomfortable around assertive women. Perhaps it’s because they view characters from a stereotypical lens. Whatever the case may be, to craft such a broad, sloppy depiction of Alice in your reviews and then flippantly write her off is a severe mistreatment of one of the greatest female protagonists this medium has to offer.“Who does Section 3 exist for? For the sake of corrupt army officers, so we turn a blind eye while they get rich, so we can have meaningless jobs? Section 3 exists for the people! If we tuck our tails and play it safe, then we’re no better than those monsters that prey on the weak, the poor, and the innocent,” - Alice L. MalvinA defender of the defenseless, a voice for the voiceless, Alice is a strong-willed idealist that’s never afraid of sharing her beliefs. Inspired as a child by her war-hero grandfather and his acts of valor, she dreams of bettering people’s lives like he once did. As captain of Section 3, Alice devotes the entirety of her being into each mission and, by proxy, her cause. She performs one impassioned oration after another, eloquently expatiating on her ideals and objectives, which not only invigorates the spirits of those around her but also rouses her spirits as well. However, Alice doesn’t exist just to monologue. Steadfastly loyal and stubborn to a dangerous degree, she’ll venture to the furthest of extremes for her beliefs, even if it involves risking her life in the process. On the one hand, the members of Section 3 are awestruck by the magnitude of Alice’s charisma and force of personality. On the other hand, they’re alternately concerned and frightened at the overwhelming effects of her stubbornness. Gradually, Alice realizes the unnecessarily hostile situations her willpower drags them into and, slowly but surely, she matures. Throughout the course of the series, Alice learns that pouring your heart and soul into minute activities exhausts your energy, that not every battle needs to be won, that forcing your beliefs onto others doesn’t always produce the desired results, that shouldering burdens by yourself isn’t a good idea. As a result, Alice develops into a more calm, rational, and controlled leader of men, one that isn’t as possessed by her passions. Where Alice once pontificated on what’s acceptable and not for a member of Section 3, now she allows them a greater level of freedom. Where Alice once involved herself in each and every conflict she observed, whether big or small, whether external or internal, now she’s willing to pick and choose only the most crucial ones. Alice’s ascent to maturity is undoubtedly among Pumpkin Scissors’ greatest feats; her arc is never emphasized or forced. Rather, it flows with the series’ overall narrative so seamlessly that it’s difficult to spot. During Pumpkin Scissors’ unforgettable finale, there is a beautiful scene where the wealthy and the unemployed finally come to terms with one another. Guns and pitchforks are tossed aside, differences are reconciled, sworn enemies dole out affectionate hugs, and the socioeconomic divide shrinks. It’s all thanks to Lt. Alice L. Malvin, who combined her fiery passion, her quixotic ideals, and the compromising nature she developed over time into a climatic speech that temporarily destroyed classism. She still has quite a ways to go before she meets the standard established by her grandfather but, when the credits roll, you feel confident in what Alice will accomplish in the future.If you’re looking for a traditional ending, where the good guys completely vanquish the presence of evil, you won’t find it in Pumpkin Scissors. What this series’ conclusion lacks in a satisfying ending, it more than compensates with pragmatism. In the real world, systemic corruption, moral depravity and other societal ills cannot be washed away with the wave of a wand or a powerful punch. Evil will linger no matter what action we take; the best we can do is minimize its’ presence as much as possible. That Pumpkin Scissors realizes this is indicative of its’ distinction. That more than a few viewers neglect this distinction is truly a shame. Much like Section 3, Pumpkin Scissors receives far too little acclaim for what it achieves. While it’s aesthetically average, monotonous in the musical sense, and tonally flawed (again, early on), Pumpkin Scissors compensates with a grandiose display of intellect. It entices, excites, educates, and enlightens, sometimes all at once. With the sublime precision of a symphony conductor and the unbridled ferocity of a flash fire, Pumpkin Scissors confidently confronts its subject matter in such a way that few can compare. With that, I leave you with a speech from Lt. Alice L. Malvin.“From now on, our opposition takes the form of people aggravating the damages of war by selfishly withholding aid and comfort from the common men and women of the Empire. And up until now, these aggravators have been able to hide from justice and they will continue to hide from us behind money, violence, and bureaucracy. These barriers are just like the outer skin of a pumpkin. This unit will become a blade, a blade of justice, one that cuts down those barriers just like the scissors we use to cut pumpkins on Halloween. We will proudly remain sharp and strong in our resolution to bring transgressors to justice. From this moment on, Pumpkin Scissors is our name!” war (of which there are many) through relief efforts. Pumpkin Scissors is an anime that primarily follows the journey of Section 3, quietly observing as they navigate through increasingly deadly circumstances; along the way, it has (unfairly) attracted comparisons to a far more renowned work, that being Hiromu Arakawa’s Fullmetal Alchemist. Both titles are focused on post-World War I Europe from the perspective of the army but that is where all similarities end. Where Fullmetal Alchemist is entrenched in the fantastical, Pumpkin Scissors is more realistic. Where Fullmetal Alchemist strives for grand statements and a wide-reaching vision, Pumpkin Scissors instead advocates for a subtler approach. This is a show that catapults its’ viewpoints to the forefront through deceptively simple character interactions in a way that’s neither overbearing nor patronizing. Each and every character, from Oreldo (Section 3’s most laid-back officer) to a brothel owner, from the slimiest of aristocrats to a tutor of a princess, from the disposable mooks to the struggling mother of a newborn girl, and (of course) the great Lt. Alice L. Malvin, is given an opportunity to express their opinions, to critique various societal ills, and to offer suggestions on how to improve our world. At its core, Pumpkin Scissors is quite the intellectually engaging show, one that expects you to ponder, reflect on, and even question what’s being presented to you. However, it also understands that it can enjoy itself at the same time and, as a result, this show makes for one memorable experience.When the military is mentioned in casual conversations, one’s mind naturally associates this term with excessive self-discipline, with rigid formations, with polished weaponry, with hours of marching, with screaming sergeants, and with gaudy displays of patriotism. Pumpkin Scissors’ central cast, however, sharply contrasts with the traditional perception of the military. Known for not taking themselves seriously, Section 3 wholeheartedly embraces an easygoing mindset and, for the most part, so does Pumpkin Scissors. Each assignment that’s designated to Section 3 is a joy for the soldiers to carry out and entertaining for the viewer to watch. In the hands of another show, standalones ranging from a package delivery to a missing baby would have amounted to a stiff, unengaging watch. Pumpkin Scissors, however, is special in its ability to transform the flimsiest of ideas, the most mundane of concepts, into something memorable. Its success in this area is due in large part to a mastery of observational humor; in other words, Pumpkin Scissors creates enjoyable experiences from ordinary circumstances by highlighting the comedic potential in them. Whether it’s by inserting sexual innuendos in unusual situations or subverting expectations with outlandish ideas, Pumpkin Scissors ensures its audience will never tire of its material. Of course, one cannot discuss this show’s humor without mentioning Oreldo and Lili. While Oreldo provides the aforementioned innuendos, alongside snarky one-liners and a solid character arc, Lili brings to the table a starkly different sense of humor. Her style of comedy is more physical than anything else but it’s also endearingly childish; Lili’s ability to coerce the rest of Section 3 into singing innocent chants alongside her never fails to put a smile on my face, and the same can be said for episode 18, which is the day in the spotlight that Lili more than deserved to have. By bringing together Oreldo’s deadpan charm and Lili’s whimsical nature, Pumpkin Scissors has two different forms of comic relief in its arsenal. That it’s capable and willing to utilize both is why its’ standalones are among this show’s greatest assets.And yet, Pumpkin Scissors’ assortment of zany adventures are not merely self-contained stories; rather, they are all individual entities that are strung together by an overarching goal. Yes, the episodes, at least the earlier ones, are more than a little cartoonish but they all strive to examine isolated aspects of 1930s Europe, to zero in on the ailments of this society, and to present solutions to them. This show prides itself in its efforts to maintain a clear, unbiased outlook on its subject matter, and that pride is certainly warranted. On one end is the homeless, the desperate, the despondent, and the distraught. On the opposite end is the wealthy, completely unaware and unconcerned with the struggles of others. And in the middle is Pumpkin Scissors, lending an ear to both sides while arguing for a world in which equality reigns supreme. This show is one that offers its perspective to a multitude of topics, including gender equality, human rights, and the futility of war, but, at its core, it is a social commentary on classism. That Pumpkin Scissors would choose the 1930s-era Europe as the setting in which to present this issue is fitting because one would argue that at no point in history was the socioeconomic divide as prevalent as it was in the Great Depression.In 1930, Austria and the United Kingdom, among others, abandoned using the “gold standard” as a monetary system; it was predicated on the value and quantity of gold, and because entire countries discontinued this system, it was a clear indication of gold’s worth. That, of course, was only the beginning. Banks began closing left and right, specifically Vienna’s Creditanstalt bank in 1931, which caused a massive economic uproar. By 1932, the value of the European trade had plummeted to a third of what it was in 1929. Everyone at the time was reeling from the Great Depression’s effects; the difference between the one percent and the majority was that the former was able to maintain a resemblance of their wealth while the latter lacked the luxuries to do so. In bleak times such as the 1930s, everyone wanted, no, needed to hear proposals to build a better society, one that wouldn’t lead to another Great Depression. Pumpkin Scissors’ perspective is one that’s worth looking into because its ideals are not only relevant to the time period it covers but they are applicable to our current society.Through the assignments that Section 3 undertake, Pumpkin Scissors lands one opportunity after another to convey its message. Through each episode, more and more insight is offered into its subject matter. At first, the situations that are presented and Section 3’s solutions to them appear as black-and-white concepts, as symbolic of good and evil. Initially, the lower-class citizens are portrayed in the most positive light possible - in fact, one would argue that Pumpkin Scissors’ earliest episodes are essentially love letters to the working class - while the aristocrats are depicted as merciless monsters, lacking any empathy or concern for their fellow humans. This perspective, the glorification of the average joe and the demonization of the patrician, is hardly unique to Pumpkin Scissors (it’s extremely prevalent in our current environment and has been for years) but what makes this show special is its’ ability to transform this perspective into a narrative device. The members of Section 3, disillusioned with the socioeconomic structure, have developed a firm confidence in this perspective; interacting with corrupt nobles and humble commoners only serves to strengthen their beliefs. However, when Section 3 confronts more powerful obstacles later in the series, their way of thinking changes for the better. Pumpkin Scissors exposes the more sinister members of the working class, they with vile and opportunistic motives, alongside a more humanizing portrayal of the wealthy (specifically with Marquis Paul) for Section 3 and the viewers to see; at the same time, it presents its’ central message and its solution to classism: the only way that our society will ever improve is if we stop discriminating each other based on socioeconomic standings and encourage open discussions on how we can help each other. One might think this proposal is too idealistic - I, for one, certainly do - but what matters is that Pumpkin Scissors never states its claims as ultimate truths. What it values are ideas, plans that will change our communities for the better, and it seeks to influence its audience in formulating said ideas. Time after time, the conflicts that Section 3 are involved in are only resolved when both sides are willing to discuss their opinions, to respect the beliefs of those they disagree with, to discover similarities, and to reconcile with differences. Now, you might be tempted to think along the lines of “What happens if someone is unwilling to compromise or if they’re too stubborn to discuss a resolution with Section 3?”. Well, my friend, that’s where Randal Oland comes in.Oland is Pumpkin Scissors’ protagonist and, while he doesn’t leave the strongest initial impression with viewers, it’s only when he’s utilized as a plot device that his potential as a character is fully realized. Don’t get me wrong; I like Oland. Mild-mannered and soft-spoken yet assertive when necessary, he’s a gentle giant that values the other members of Section 3 above all else. Oland’s a decent guy (my favorite memory of him is when, in a particularly touching scene, he prevents an injured and unemployed factory worker from killing himself) but, at the same time, he’s more than a little shallow and one-dimensional.. initially, at least. At various points in the show, there are times when Section 3 cannot resolve issues through normal means and it’s in these situations where Oland abandons his “nice guy” role. You know he means business when he flicks on that lantern he always carries. Illuminated by the ominous mist that emanates from his lantern, Oland, with the glazed, unhinged stare of a zombie and his infamous handgun (the “Door Knocker”), demolishes any overwhelming obstacle that Section 3 encounters, whether it be a tank or a squadron of trained killers, in an expedient fashion. Anytime the show’s writers find themselves in a dicey scenario, it’s Oland that almost always bails them out; he’s a walking deus ex machina. While it would be convenient for Pumpkin Scissors to leave this matter as is, Oland’s moments of invincibility are highlighted by the devastating after-effects that spawn from them.Once upon a time, there was a mysterious division of the Royal Empire militia that was discontinued because of how ruthless its members were. This division was known as the “Invisible Nine” and Oland was among them. The scenes where he is forced to employ what he acquired from his “Invisible Nine” days are among Pumpkin Scissors’ most memorable moments. A Gregorian chorus screams in the background and the skies blacken as Oland’s Door Knocker wreaks havoc on all it comes in contact with. He slowly trudges toward his target, entirely unfazed by the bullets that decorate his body, as bystanders cannot resist gazing in horror. It’s understandable; after all, these scenes are frightening spectacles unlike any other. All of a sudden, it’s over. The Gregorian chorus fades into nothingness, the skies brighten, and Pumpkin Scissors resumes its regularly scheduled programming. As for Oland, he’s not as fortunate. See, when he activates his lantern, Oland’s not exactly invulnerable; his zombified state temporarily numbs the pain of whatever injury is inflicted on him so when he’s done destroying everything, any damage he absorbed along the way affects his body when he reverts to normal. Sure, Oland can automatically overpower any opponent he faces but that doesn’t amount to much when he has to be hospitalized immediately afterwards. Every fight that Oland involves himself in are accompanied by a collection of gruesome injuries and more than a few mental scars. Not only does he have to confront an inferiority complex (created because he feels he contributes nothing to Section 3 other than his wanton acts of destruction) but he also has to battle his PTSD (he’s reminded of his “Invisible Nine” days and the people he killed anytime he’s forced to use his lantern) and then there’s the thought in the back of his mind that he cannot resist mulling over. There are times when Oland imagines a day in which he’s forced to activate his lantern but is too frightened of the after-effects to go through with it, in which his overreliance on the lantern ends up destroying him. It’s when Pumpkin Scissors becomes a more serious show that Oland’s deepest, darkest fear morphs into a reality.In a two-parter involving the kidnapping of Lt. Alice L. Malvin, the flaws of Section 3 emerge for all to see and the same can be said for Pumpkin Scissors itself. Our protagonists commit severe errors in judgment and the effects of these errors are colossal. For the first time ever (and not the last), Oland’s Door Knocker isn’t enough to save the day; he can barely defend himself, let alone fight, when a powerful assailant attacks him. Finally, the members of Section 3 fail in the protecting the lives of innocent civilians, also a first. This two-parter is the initial showing of this show’s potential, a vivid glimpse into what it can (and eventually does) accomplish later. With that, one would expect the succeeding episode to amplify the morbid atmosphere of the two-parter, to develop Oland’s inferiority complex, and to (at the very least) investigate into who Oland’s attacker works for (you know, what the show has been hinting about since its earliest episodes).One would be incorrect.Apparently, some big shot on the Pumpkin Scissors staff gave the aforementioned two-parter a hard look, observing the vilest corners of the human heart, the monstrosities of the Royal Empire, and the intensely emotional core of it all, and declared “For the next episode, I want a silly love story between Section 3’s most worthless member and a character nobody will ever see again. Yep; I really think this is an ideal fit for the narrative and tone of the series”.

We will proudly remain sharp and strong in our resolution to bring transgressors to justice. From this moment on, Pumpkin Scissors is our name!”', 'While I believe that a responsible critic should judge each creation on its own individual merits, there are times when the existence of a comparable alternative that surpasses the subject in question on just about every level is evidence enough that it could have been ""done better"". That holds especially true in this case, where said alternative is widely considered to be essential viewing for anime fans. I mention this because from the military-ruled state to the lower class that\'s still suffering from the wounds left by war, right down to the noticeably similar art style, Pumpkin Scissors comes out looking an awful lot like...a poor man\'s Fullmetal Alchemist. Take Ed and Al out of the equation to focus almost entirely on Roy and his gang, and then switch Roy out for an idealistic novice, and you pretty much have Pumpkin Scissors, complete with a dog as their team mascot. Oh, and replace Armstrong with a stoner (okay, not really) who lives under a bridge. Having said that, if you know my opinion of FMA (it\'s a high one to say the least) then you\'ll know that my saying Pumpkin Scissors isn\'t as good is hardly a condemnation. If you didn\'t like any iteration of FMA you almost certainly won\'t like this, but for the 99% of you who are still here there is an actual review ahead.I really didn\'t want to have to make fun of Gonzo again, and indeed this show isn\'t nearly as ugly as Glass Fleet, but that\'s not saying much. It\'s not terrible; the use of CG is minimal, the lighting and backgrounds are competent, but the character designs have a tendency to get sloppy and uneven at the drop of a hat, the movements are stiff, fights aren\'t especially well-choreographed and lacking in dynamic action, and it\'s a pretty rough package all-around. The only moments the animation really shines are the mind trip sequences where we get a look into Randel\'s head and how it\'s been tampered with, which sport excellent color choices, good use of shadows and some minimalistic but surprisingly effective design work, and members of The Invisible Nine are genuinely creepy and threatening. Other than that, this show sits comfortably at the lower end of okay.The music is a mix of military trumpets, whistles and drumbeats with a few wind and orchestra pieces mixed in. This sounds fitting in theory, but in execution it’s unfortunately a bit on the forgettable side, and I guess that’s all I have to say about it.I just wish I could call the English dub forgettable, but that would be a generous compliment. Oreldo is pretty good, but Alice is just okay, Randel sounds stoned half the time (I\'m not sure if that was intentional), and about a third of the tertiary characters are downright unlistenable. Apparently ADV was undergoing a merger at the time and they ended up with a lot of voice actors who, to put it bluntly, can’t act. A few shows got the short end of the stick, and this is definitely one of them. Awkward accents and ridiculously slurred speech patterns abound. The Japanese soundtrack, while not outstanding, is at least much more consistent, so I\'ll have to recommend going sub over dub for this one.Setting aside the (unfavorable) FMA comparisons for a moment, Pumpkin Scissors does have a lot of good to offer, and the first pleasant surprise is its characters. Alice initially comes across as something of a female Naruto: she\'s brash, straightforward and charges in headfirst with little strategy, complete with an orange outfit. Thankfully, it quickly becomes clear that Alice is not as naïve as she initially appears; she clings to her child-like idealism not because she doesn\'t understand how the real world works--she\'s the daughter and probable heir of a high ranking noble house and fully understands that responsibility begins at the top--but because she believes that such idealism is simply what the world needs to make their time of peace really mean something. It\'s not realistic, but both she and the show are aware of this, and that turns into the show\'s biggest saving grace; while FMA was much better at moral ambiguities and gray areas, a little idealism really can be a refreshing change of pace every now and again. That said, Alice should be flayed alive for giving her team the name Pumpkin Scissors (she tries to explain what it means to her but utterly fails to make it any less stupid). Her subordinates Martis and especially Oreldo also have hidden depths, and while they\'re not given as much time as I might\'ve liked they\'re still far better fleshed-out than many lackey characters in similar positions. It\'s clear, however, that Randel is supposed to be the real meat of the story. I\'ll get back to him in a moment.Even though Pumpkin Scissors is supposed to be about war relief, I think its greatest strength is addressing separation of the social classes, a problem that can become especially apparent during war and its immediate aftermath--after all, nobles have the resources to endure through hard time and the crafty ones can even profit from them--but it\'s a far cry from exclusive to wartime. Still, the increasing tension during a postwar depression and the lack of work and rations is definitely truth in television, and I think it\'s a pretty nice touch. The show does a pretty good job of portraying the discontented masses who are tired of being abused and mistrustful of those born into riches. I\'ll also applaud the show for not making all the nobles look like pompous assholes (though there are certainly a few like that), in some cases they even show genuine guilt for not taking more responsibility for their fellow men. Again, Pumpkin Scissors is a very idealistic show, but it still manages to feel honest about it without feeling like it\'s trying to strongarm the audience into listening, and while it can get a bit corny and on-the-nose with its messages, you still want to believe in the ideals it\'s pressing.Now to talk about the downside, namely: Randel Oland. He\'s Pumpkin Scissors\' newest recruit and the only member of the team who actually saw any action in the war. What\'s more, he\'s actually a very gentle and peace-loving soul at heart, but he\'s been brainwashed to transform into a terrifying human juggernaut who can single handedly bring down a tank, a side of himself he clearly wishes he could leave behind but keeps tapping into either out of necessity or sometimes just a pure uncontrollable urge. This, unfortunately, makes him sound a helluva lot more interesting and well-developed than he actually is. One problem with the show is that it can\'t really decide how much self-control Randel is supposed to have when he\'s in his blue lantern state. Most episodes seem to indicate that it turns him into a complete killing machine, but there are multiple occasions where the show breaks this rule, seemingly on a whim, and it\'s never treated like a feat of willpower or personal fortitude. It just sort of happens whenever the writers feel like he needs to come and save the day, and this really keeps his personal struggle from having the gravity it feels like it should, it just feels forced and makes his character feel needlessly mopey. He\'s seven hulking feet of missed opportunity.Perhaps a guilty conscience might\'ve made up for it, but he doesn\'t seem to have one of those either, or if he does we never see it. We get the impression he\'s deeply hurt by what he saw during the war, but most of the show\'s attempts at developing him are focused on his half-baked existential crisis as a human weapon, all else ignored. Now yes, it is charming to see him slowly warming up to his teammates and forming a tighter bond with them, but even his casual interactions are pretty dull, and it doesn\'t help that the show has a crappy sense of humor. For every one heartwarming moment there are ten that just leave you scratching your head wondering how you\'re supposed to react, and the show even makes frequent jokes about the other big gun Randel is implied to be carrying... enough said. It just doesn\'t have FMA\'s finesse when it comes to balancing different tones, and in half as many episodes it manages to include a few nearly pointless filler episodes with lame plots. The worst part is that the show peaks at episode 17, the climax of a really, really good arc that seemed to be setting Randel up to face what he is and what\'s hidden in his past, only for him to get over it the very next episode in a resolution so forced it leaves a bad taste for the rest of the show, just when it was about to reach new heights.I really need to stop reviewing manga/light novel adaptations with ongoing source material, because complaining about read-the-manga endings is getting old, and Pumpkin Scissors has just that. Honestly, though, it\'s astounding how much in this show goes absolutely nowhere; In addition to Randel\'s inconclusive character arc there\'s the implied government conspiracy surrounding the Invisible Nine, Alice\'s relationship with her enigmatic fiancé Lionel, her implied sixth sense, and a myriad of other loose plot threads hanging around waiting for a second season that, if sales are to be believed, will probably never happen. No, all we\'re left with is a six-episode arc with enough staring contests that it probably could\'ve been cut down to three, and it certainly wasn\'t the right place to end the show. To be fair, the arc actually got a pretty heartfelt resolution, but that\'s like sticking a band-aid on a gunshot wound. Not a lethal wound, mind you, but the damage is done, and what\'s left feels like it\'s long since bled out the best of its potential.But maybe I\'m being too harsh. While Pumpkin Scissors certainly isn\'t anywhere near as refined as Fullmetal Alchemist, it does have heart. It really cares about what it has to say, and tries to say it in a memorable way. This may be an ""if you have nothing else to watch"" recommendation, but I\'m recommending it nonetheless, for better or for worse. The characters are surprisingly easy to care about, it\'s somehow charming even when it\'s stumbling around meaninglessly, the setup is a good one, and on the one in a hundred chance it does eventually get a second season I\'ll be rooting for it all the way through, even if I have to chuckle every time I hear them say the name ""Pumpkin Scissors"" with a straight face. a poor man\'s Fullmetal Alchemist. Take Ed and Al out of the equation to focus almost entirely on Roy and his gang, and then switch Roy out for an idealistic novice, and you pretty much have Pumpkin Scissors, complete with a dog as their team mascot. Oh, and replace Armstrong with a stoner (okay, not really) who lives under a bridge. Having said that, if you know my opinion of FMA (it\'s a high one to say the least) then you\'ll know that my saying Pumpkin Scissors isn\'t as good is hardly a condemnation. If you didn\'t like any iteration of FMA you almost certainly won\'t like this, but for the 99% of you who are still here there is an actual review ahead.I really didn\'t want to have to make fun of Gonzo again, and indeed this show isn\'t nearly as ugly as Glass Fleet, but that\'s not saying much. It\'s not terrible; the use of CG is minimal, the lighting and backgrounds are competent, but the character designs have a tendency to get sloppy and uneven at the drop of a hat, the movements are stiff, fights aren\'t especially well-choreographed and lacking in dynamic action, and it\'s a pretty rough package all-around. The only moments the animation really shines are the mind trip sequences where we get a look into Randel\'s head and how it\'s been tampered with, which sport excellent color choices, good use of shadows and some minimalistic but surprisingly effective design work, and members of The Invisible Nine are genuinely creepy and threatening. Other than that, this show sits comfortably at the lower end of okay.The music is a mix of military trumpets, whistles and drumbeats with a few wind and orchestra pieces mixed in. This sounds fitting in theory, but in execution it’s unfortunately a bit on the forgettable side, and I guess that’s all I have to say about it.I just wish I could call the English dub forgettable, but that would be a generous compliment. Oreldo is pretty good, but Alice is just okay, Randel sounds stoned half the time (I\'m not sure if that was intentional), and about a third of the tertiary characters are downright unlistenable. Apparently ADV was undergoing a merger at the time and they ended up with a lot of voice actors who, to put it bluntly, can’t act. A few shows got the short end of the stick, and this is definitely one of them. Awkward accents and ridiculously slurred speech patterns abound. The Japanese soundtrack, while not outstanding, is at least much more consistent, so I\'ll have to recommend going sub over dub for this one.Setting aside the (unfavorable) FMA comparisons for a moment, Pumpkin Scissors does have a lot of good to offer, and the first pleasant surprise is its characters. Alice initially comes across as something of a female Naruto: she\'s brash, straightforward and charges in headfirst with little strategy, complete with an orange outfit. Thankfully, it quickly becomes clear that Alice is not as naïve as she initially appears; she clings to her child-like idealism not because she doesn\'t understand how the real world works--she\'s the daughter and probable heir of a high ranking noble house and fully understands that responsibility begins at the top--but because she believes that such idealism is simply what the world needs to make their time of peace really mean something. It\'s not realistic, but both she and the show are aware of this, and that turns into the show\'s biggest saving grace; while FMA was much better at moral ambiguities and gray areas, a little idealism really can be a refreshing change of pace every now and again. That said, Alice should be flayed alive for giving her team the name Pumpkin Scissors (she tries to explain what it means to her but utterly fails to make it any less stupid). Her subordinates Martis and especially Oreldo also have hidden depths, and while they\'re not given as much time as I might\'ve liked they\'re still far better fleshed-out than many lackey characters in similar positions. It\'s clear, however, that Randel is supposed to be the real meat of the story. I\'ll get back to him in a moment.Even though Pumpkin Scissors is supposed to be about war relief, I think its greatest strength is addressing separation of the social classes, a problem that can become especially apparent during war and its immediate aftermath--after all, nobles have the resources to endure through hard time and the crafty ones can even profit from them--but it\'s a far cry from exclusive to wartime. Still, the increasing tension during a postwar depression and the lack of work and rations is definitely truth in television, and I think it\'s a pretty nice touch. The show does a pretty good job of portraying the discontented masses who are tired of being abused and mistrustful of those born into riches. I\'ll also applaud the show for not making all the nobles look like pompous assholes (though there are certainly a few like that), in some cases they even show genuine guilt for not taking more responsibility for their fellow men. Again, Pumpkin Scissors is a very idealistic show, but it still manages to feel honest about it without feeling like it\'s trying to strongarm the audience into listening, and while it can get a bit corny and on-the-nose with its messages, you still want to believe in the ideals it\'s pressing.Now to talk about the downside, namely: Randel Oland. He\'s Pumpkin Scissors\' newest recruit and the only member of the team who actually saw any action in the war. What\'s more, he\'s actually a very gentle and peace-loving soul at heart, but he\'s been brainwashed to transform into a terrifying human juggernaut who can single handedly bring down a tank, a side of himself he clearly wishes he could leave behind but keeps tapping into either out of necessity or sometimes just a pure uncontrollable urge. This, unfortunately, makes him sound a helluva lot more interesting and well-developed than he actually is. One problem with the show is that it can\'t really decide how much self-control Randel is supposed to have when he\'s in his blue lantern state. Most episodes seem to indicate that it turns him into a complete killing machine, but there are multiple occasions where the show breaks this rule, seemingly on a whim, and it\'s never treated like a feat of willpower or personal fortitude. It just sort of happens whenever the writers feel like he needs to come and save the day, and this really keeps his personal struggle from having the gravity it feels like it should, it just feels forced and makes his character feel needlessly mopey. He\'s seven hulking feet of missed opportunity.Perhaps a guilty conscience might\'ve made up for it, but he doesn\'t seem to have one of those either, or if he does we never see it.

It’s about secrets within the military that during peaceful times come to hunt the people of the world they live in. It’s pretty much about what happens after the war and what we normally don’t see living in the United States since we haven’t had a battle happen on our land in such a long time.

Arrows that sprouts giant mushrooms, suited up mafia with a bunny mascot headgear. And what's worth it is, everything fits right in due to how much of a struggle life is due to the rust wind people adapt, they learn new tricks they change andam sure the modern comfy world would never allow a slug plane XD.But for the first project of a new anime studio (even tho they have some great people working there), this seems rather promising, I cant wait to see what else they have in store for us!The world of sabikui Bisco is really well done so much so that my trash taste in anime wants to even call it a fit for the isekai world. The Post-apocalyptic theme is mostly downplayed by many animes but here, you can tell every day is a struggle to survive, people literally rusting o death, eating what they can find, getting addicted to weird mushrooms, and children wielding weapons just to protect themselves. It's dark, depressing, and full of mystery and yet life finds a way to thrive and so do humans. The music in this anime is really amazing the person who chose and composed the music needs a raise, the music fits so well to the half-dead fallen world which rusts away literally and is magical and sometimes hallucinating levels of weird shit happening all around (the author was probably on drugs).I’ll get straight into the rating since I want to keep the viewing experience as unspoiled as possible.Plot (7/10)Well, it's kind of a generic shounen start, adventure begins to find something (this time it ain't one piece, it's the cure to rust wind). The weakest part of the plot is probably that one asspull that happened, but that will depend on tolerance for that kind of thing. but it certainly has a sense of familiarity when one thinks of other shounen shows.Characters (8/10)Milo and Bisco are like JOBROS level of bro story, MIlo may seem annoying at times but he does change for the better towards the middle and the end, Bisco is goddamn best boi something along the lines of a good tsundere guy who isn't flustered at being nice but is just not very used to people,Pawoo develops really well towards the end after everything is cleared up. Tsuda kenjiro and kurokawa are a perfect match (those who know do send FR). jabi and the kids also have a pretty good personality.Sound and VA(10/10)The Best I have seen out of any new release, Op is a straight banger, the rumbling is a great blessing to rock fans this will make them cream their pants.ED is JOBRO the ending 100% that is totally the vibe any Jojo fan will feel. Tsuda Kenjiro is totally the best VA one can pick for anti-hero or fucked up villain there is no contention in that regard. The VA of Pawoo was also a great and unique voice, it totally helps reflect her strength and confidence and the rest of the characters didn't stand out that much but are great nonetheless.Art and animation (9/10)The Art is so really good, (only akebi chan has a realistic chance of beating it, but it wouldn't be fair since the tone is different for both) although it loses some points in animation, the art is absolutely gorgeous and immediately makes it clear that this is a post-apocalyptic world. The dead tetsujin statue being repurposed into a living space, dark and wild plants that grow and evolve to fight the new environment they find themselves in, a dull but alive city that barely holds on to hope, it's perfect.A must watch if you loved the trailer, it's surely great to see a new idea being executed this well, it had way more potential IMO but I must say this is still one of the best this season, by all means, Do not let the mediocre score waver you and definitely give it 3 episodes to let it sink in. at the very least, do watch the trailer. up with screamfest? \t—lessPlot armor?       —more than kiritoNakama no chikara (power of friendship?)      —naruto will be proudGeneric power system world and MC starts weak?   —noMain rival?   —noneTeacher?     —nopeWaifu?        — God tier and also legal!So it is clearly a min-max build xDA lot of annoying shounen tropes are cut off but the others that are present have a power level beyond 9000!For those who aren't keen on that please stick around and read the rest.This anime has the best-built world out of any anime in 2022 so far ….Machine gun hippos, giant shrooms, slug planes, giant rod wielding hot woman :3. Arrows that sprouts giant mushrooms, suited up mafia with a bunny mascot headgear. And what's worth it is, everything fits right in due to how much of a struggle life is due to the rust wind people adapt, they learn new tricks they change andam sure the modern comfy world would never allow a slug plane XD.But for the first project of a new anime studio (even tho they have some great people working there), this seems rather promising, I cant wait to see what else they have in store for us!The world of sabikui Bisco is really well done so much so that my trash taste in anime wants to even call it a fit for the isekai world. The Post-apocalyptic theme is mostly downplayed by many animes but here, you can tell every day is a struggle to survive, people literally rusting o death, eating what they can find, getting addicted to weird mushrooms, and children wielding weapons just to protect themselves. It's dark, depressing, and full of mystery and yet life finds a way to thrive and so do humans. The music in this anime is really amazing the person who chose and composed the music needs a raise, the music fits so well to the half-dead fallen world which rusts away literally and is magical and sometimes hallucinating levels of weird shit happening all around (the author was probably on drugs).I’ll get straight into the rating since I want to keep the viewing experience as unspoiled as possible.Plot (7/10)Well, it's kind of a generic shounen start, adventure begins to find something (this time it ain't one piece, it's the cure to rust wind).

The officer manning the checkpoint is making small talk with a man who’s trying to pass through, and both men are looking at a wanted poster. The wanted poster features a man with unmistakable red hair and green eyes wielding a green bow and arrow. The man trying to pass through is suspiciously covered from head to toe in rags, and he even wrapped his face. However, his eyes are visible, and they’re green. He’s also carrying a green...bow and arrow on his back in a way that is clearly visible from the front. The officer mentions how the checkpoint they’re standing at is the “last line of defense” against escaped prisoners and criminals, and he literally says, “You never know when any of the bounties posted there [on the wanted board] might try to come through.” The officer asks the traveler his name, and he responds with something that doesn’t sound like a real name. When pressed on this, he admits it’s not his real name, and while he makes a flimsy excuse about being a monk (which even the lazy border guard finds odd, since monks apparently don’t travel this way very often), he is—in real terms—openly hiding his identity. While the officer makes arrangements for the man to pass through anyway, he continues musing about the man on the poster, describing his green bow and arrow and how dangerous it is. “No need to worry, though,” he says, “No villain’s ever gotten past the unrivaled Gunma Watch.” The mechanic finally fixes the gate, and the officer proceeds to let the man pass. It’s only until after the man flashes his weapon and openly admits to carrying A TRUCKLOAD OF DEAD BODIES, the officer finally realizes what you realized six sentences ago. If you don’t see why this is so astronomically retarded, then you’ve either been living under a rock since September 11th, 2001, or you yourself are the writer of Sabikui Bisco.The writing, pacing, and editing of this whole show just feels slightly off. Perhaps some level of amateurishness should be expected since this director has never helmed a TV anime before, and he’s helming it at a first-time studio no less, but either way, it’s simply not well adapted. I don’t want this review to contain any major spoilers, so let me dissect some more of episode one. The first episode can be summed up as follows: post-apocalypse where terrorists fight with giant magic mushrooms, red man shows up at the gate, blue man is a doctor and gets harassed by corrupt city governor, city governor has to stop harassing blue man because red man breaks into the city and wrecks shit. At the very end of the episode after all this action had taken place, a cute girl with pink hair is thrown at the feet of the governor who looks like he’s angry with her. When I first watched the episode, this was a really confusing sequence, because as you can tell by my lovely synopsis, this girl wasn’t in the episode up until that point. After skimming back through the episode, I figured it out, but the context was so muddled, no one unfamiliar with the source material would’ve been able to keep track of what actually happened. You see, the way this episode was structured is actually kinda clever—or at least it would’ve been clever had they done it in a way that wasn’t so confusing. The scene I described in the first paragraph where red man, Bisco, shows up at the gate and talks to the border security officer actually takes place over the course of the entire episode, which cuts back and forth between the afternoon hours where that scene takes place to the evening hours where we’re introduced to blue man, Milo. By the end of the episode, it’s clear that Bisco broke though the gate during the afternoon, and by the time the sun had gone down, he had fought past the city’s security and started wrecking shit in the city at night.This double timeline, in and of itself, isn’t confusing. What’s confusing is the director doesn’t seem to understand that for the viewer to comprehend it, they need some sort of anchor to let them know what timeline they’re watching. In this case, there’s two natural anchors: the time of day and the character being focused on. The viewer implicitly understands that if the sun is up and Bisco is on screen, we’re in timeline one, and if the sun is down and Milo is on screen, we’re in timeline two. Going by this logic, the viewer will have seen enough of the scene described in the first paragraph to know how it resolves by the end of the episode, so when Bisco shows up at night, it’s not confusing since you know exactly how he got from timeline one to timeline two: he revealed his identity to the border security guard and fought his way though to the city. Makes sense, right? So how does the girl with pink hair, Tirol, factor in to all of this? Well, in the middle of the episode, it randomly cuts to a scene with Bisco at night, thusly challenging the logic of the double timeline and making it so you’re not quite sure when this scene takes place. He’s getting shot at by a gunship piloted by someone wearing a bunny mask, he shoots their missiles out of the sky with his bow, and then you see a giant fucking lobster, because why not? Apparently, the person in that bunny mask was Tirol, and the reason you see her at the end of the episode getting thrown at the feet of the governor is that she works for him, was supposed to protect the city from people like Bisco with the gunship, and failed to do so. By that point, you’ve seen all the governor’s henchman wearing bunny masks, but you see the scene with Tirol in the gunship BEFORE you see the governor or any of his other bunny-masked henchmen to establish their shared uniform, so unless you recognized the voice actress, that gunship scene is complete nonlinear nonsense.To me, that scene was the first of many red flags, and the series proceeded to be just as jumbled as episode one. So far, this review has been extremely meticulous, and I doubt many people are still reading this trash, but if you are, then you’ve probably been wondering, “Post-apocalypse? Giant Mushrooms? Giant lobsters? Bunny masks? What the hell is going on in this show?” And that’s a really good fucking question. I’m sorry to be so blunt, but Sabikui Bisco is dumb. It’s a stupid show. I really want to give it credit for being unique, but that’s like giving credit to The Last Jedi because it “subverted your expectations.” Yes, this show has a lot of stuff in it that you don’t see every day, but it doesn’t really do anything with any of its concepts. To repurpose a great Hyouka quote, it’s as unpracticed as it is trying to be different. The character designs are by the same guy who did the designs for Id:Invaded, and while they look just as good, they looked so similar that I couldn’t stop comparing this show to that one, and the comparisons weren’t flattering. Id:Invaded was an incredibly creative, surprisingly sentimental, and fascinatingly weird show that honestly would’ve been my favorite anime of 2020 if it wasn’t for its subpar animation. It’s not often a show with such a shoddy production can make me laugh, cry, and everything in between, but Id:Invaded did exactly that. I could shower that show with praise all day, but you get the point: the fact it was fifty times more bizarre than even Sabikui Bisco didn’t stop it from being a phenomenal anime. Sabikui Bisco definitely shares some of its weirdness, but it’s not Otarō Maijō weirdness where you can tell there’s clearly some thematic point being made. It’s just haphazard nonsense. Ideally, the show would then be carried by the strength of its characters, but if not for the shitty animation, the characters would unfortunately be the worst thing about the show.For a show with such odd concepts and such an odd setting, the characters couldn’t be any more generic. Bisco is a forgettable, uninspiring Mary Sue who you can’t empathize with at all; Pawoo, Bisco’s adversary, only considers him an enemy thanks to some cheap misunderstanding constructed for the sole purpose of making your two “good guys” fight each other while still being morally righteous; Jabi, the old man, is the same father figure moral compass you’ve seen a thousand times in every shounen anime ever; and Milo literally feels like the protagonist from Yuri!!! On Ice. I’m serious. He is SUCH a cookie-cutter BL protagonist, it’s not even funny. From the niche talent which the love interest needs to rely on him for, to the bangs and effeminate body-type, Milo embodies every BL protagonist trope in the book. Sabikui Bisco is set in a post-apocalyptic world where Japan has been reduced to a desert wasteland filled with giant mutated monsters and eccentric marauders running around causing trouble. It’s never made particularly clear how the world actually got like this aside from the Akira-style cold open where we see Tokyo getting nuked, but somehow and over some period of time, the population has reforged civilization and modern cities have been rebuilt, so the world that could’ve been really cool and interesting? Yeah, it’s just dilapidated Tokyo in the desert. The plotline ultimately turns out to be a nothing burger as well. Bisco is labeled a terrorist because he uses the giant magic mushrooms, and the giant magic mushrooms cause everyone to be infected by the Ruin from Casshern Sins. However, it turns out the mushrooms actually cure the Ruin and Bisco was the good guy all along. And this totally-not-utterly-predictable reveal comes in episode fucking two. In a single word, the show just feels deflated, and it reenforces the style-over-substance feeling you get from the weird concepts.If click and drag animation was an Olympic Sport, this show would be a gold fucking medalist. Let’s say you’re an animation studio and you need to animate people riding giant hippos or giant iguanas, but you don’t have the time or talent to do so. If you’re Studio OZ, the solution seems to be simply drawing a single frame and then dragging it up and down. What about having to animate giant mushrooms that grow out of thin air? Just layer the foreground and background such that you can draw a single frame of a fully grown mushroom and pull it out from behind the layer. You know? Just like Shichiro Kobayashi did on cels in the fucking 1970s before they even had computers. What about having to animate giant lobsters from multiple angles so you can’t do what you did with the hippos and iguanas? Just use CG that looks worse than the giant roaches from Mystérique Sign, an episode which aired in 2006. The character art looks fantastic (when the drawings are actually on-model), but otherwise the show looks totally wooden. The soundtrack is decent, but it doesn’t take long for it to start feeling like half-baked, wannabe Taku Iwasaki music. The direction is generally unimaginative, and it unsuccessfully tries to rely on the wackiness of the imagery to make up for the fact the cinematography is nothing special. This could’ve worked if the artwork and animation were stunning on their own, but as we’ve already established, that isn’t the case at all. The inconsistent background art certainly doesn’t help either, especially when they had such unique settings to work with. I really wanted to like this show, and maybe a 3/10 is too harsh and I'm just being a dumb bitch, but no amount of random bullshit can excuse—let alone untangle—such a mess of an anime. If you’re bored and just want to watch something weird and different, then by all means, watch Sabikui Bisco, but if you’re looking for a legitimately good show, then I’m afraid you’ll have to look somewhere else.Thank you for reading. bow and arrow on his back in a way that is clearly visible from the front.

What started out as a unique and gritty looking story in the first few episodes, became an extremely convoluted one full of plot holes and errors that made it a drag to watch. The build up to the climax of this show was great, but the climax itself was one of the most disappointing things I have seen in a while, and that’s truly a shame.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 8.5/25At the outset, this seemed like an interesting concept. In...a dystopian society called Imihama that was ravaged by rust, we see Milo, our character, live his life by investigating this “rust disease” and treating patients at a clinic. We see the seemingly scheming governor of this society, Kurokawa, who seemed like a very intriguing villain. I was thoroughly intrigued at this point.After that, Bisco appears, with a bow and arrow in which the arrows make mushrooms grow on whatever they hit, which was an interesting concept. Following a reveal about the true nature of the rusting and its effect on humans, Bisco and Milo embark on a journey.The rest of the build up you can watch yourself, but the underlying problems are the lack of a general direction of the plot.*SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHThe climax of the story is where it all fell apart. Kurokawa is the corrupt governor that has a hand in this entire rust issue, and Bisco and Milo confront him, but he proves tough to outsmart. My gripe with this entire sequence of events is that when there’s a clear opportunity to defeat him, Bisco spares him, and it led to more disasters down the road, including the demise of someone, which was another poorly executed “emotional” scene. Anything after that scene was just not good anymore, with the huge monster Tetsujin and all. It became generic and uninteresting.ART: 7.7/10The overall art style is good, but it looks very grimy, if you know what I mean.MUSIC: 8.6/10The soundtrack is pretty good, and both the opening and ending are one my favourites of the season.CHARACTERS: 5.5/20Much like the story, the characters felt very interesting to start, but either didn’t play enough of a role (characters like Tirol, and anyone from the children’s fortress come to mind), or didn’t get good development down the road. In the action scenes, they made questionable decisions, and much of the character quality dropped with the story quality, which was a shame. Wish we could also know more about Bisco’s backstory and some more details about mushroom keepers and more about rusting in general. For Milo, the developments he got felt out of place, as characters shouldn’t be turning their personality into something that seems like the polar opposite for their personality, it was just a bit much. As for the villain, Kurokawa, he was way too basic, and his demise was very anticlimactic.ENJOYMENT: 7.8/15Enjoyment declined with the overall narrative, but I enjoyed the first part.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 12/20This show tries their hand at many themes, and I do think they build the atmosphere nicely, with that dark tone around Imihama, and overall in the story. The adventure element was alright, but the action themes weren’t all that great, especially the last part against the Tetsujin, because of the plot issues there. The emotional side to the story did not pan out due to the tragic situations being clearly avoidable.OVERALL: 50.1/100It’s really a shame that the climax wasn’t executed very well, and made the story fall off afterwards, but for what it’s worth, the world had a nice vibe to it, and it was definitely an attempt at an unique concept, but it wasn’t flushed out very well. Last bit seemed rushed, but pacing seemed to be an issue throughout. 8/10 for the first eight episodes, 2/10 for the last four episodes. For Studio Oz’s first anime, it was average, and we hope to see some better things from them in the future. a dystopian society called Imihama that was ravaged by rust, we see Milo, our character, live his life by investigating this “rust disease” and treating patients at a clinic.

Following a reveal about the true nature of the rusting and its effect on humans, Bisco and Milo embark on a journey.The rest of the build up you can watch yourself, but the underlying problems are the lack of a general direction of the plot.*SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHThe climax of the story is where it all fell apart. Kurokawa is the corrupt governor that has a hand in this entire rust issue, and Bisco and Milo confront him, but he proves tough to outsmart. My gripe with this entire sequence of events is that when there’s a clear opportunity to defeat him, Bisco spares him, and it led to more disasters down the road, including the demise of someone, which was another poorly executed “emotional” scene. Anything after that scene was just not good anymore, with the huge monster Tetsujin and all. It became generic and uninteresting.ART: 7.7/10The overall art style is good, but it looks very grimy, if you know what I mean.MUSIC: 8.6/10The soundtrack is pretty good, and both the opening and ending are one my favourites of the season.CHARACTERS: 5.5/20Much like the story, the characters felt very interesting to start, but either didn’t play enough of a role (characters like Tirol, and anyone from the children’s fortress come to mind), or didn’t get good development down the road. In the action scenes, they made questionable decisions, and much of the character quality dropped with the story quality, which was a shame. Wish we could also know more about Bisco’s backstory and some more details about mushroom keepers and more about rusting in general. For Milo, the developments he got felt out of place, as characters shouldn’t be turning their personality into something that seems like the polar opposite for their personality, it was just a bit much. As for the villain, Kurokawa, he was way too basic, and his demise was very anticlimactic.ENJOYMENT: 7.8/15Enjoyment declined with the overall narrative, but I enjoyed the first part.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 12/20This show tries their hand at many themes, and I do think they build the atmosphere nicely, with that dark tone around Imihama, and overall in the story. The adventure element was alright, but the action themes weren’t all that great, especially the last part against the Tetsujin, because of the plot issues there. The emotional side to the story did not pan out due to the tragic situations being clearly avoidable.OVERALL: 50.1/100It’s really a shame that the climax wasn’t executed very well, and made the story fall off afterwards, but for what it’s worth, the world had a nice vibe to it, and it was definitely an attempt at an unique concept, but it wasn’t flushed out very well. Last bit seemed rushed, but pacing seemed to be an issue throughout. 8/10 for the first eight episodes, 2/10 for the last four episodes. For Studio Oz’s first anime, it was average, and we hope to see some better things from them in the future.', 'In most shows I\'ve reviewed, I primarily focus on the enjoyment and aspects that I noticed when I watched the show. If the show has terrible characters, then I would state that, if it has sluggish animation, I would say that too. However, most of that is put in particular aspects in which anything referring to art would be talked about the artistic backgrounds and designs of our characters.For this particular case, I want to make a different approach to this anime called Sabikui Bisco and make a full-fledged review, vastly different from what I have written. Without further ado, time to start.""I love you.""Ah...yes, Sabikui Bisco. When I first looked at the trailer, I thought I was promised an intriguing world filled with mysteries and bizarre details that caused the world they lived into oblivion. The characters had unique designs and stand out, the soundtrack was also quite bizarre, which took a while for me to settle, but I found it to be quite fitting. If I were to remember, I rewatched the preview about 10 different times, becoming one of my anticipated shows this Winter. As I have said, I was hoping for an enriched apocalyptic world that had something to show other than its competitors. Unfortunately, I am filled with sheer disappointment as every episode that came out, it was getting worse the more I looked at it.First, we must talk about the story, the synopsis of the story unravels about a post-apocalyptic Tokyo after being poisoned by the plague-like wind of rust. From the first sentence, it\'s already a problem. Rust is supposedly a reaction that only happens to anything that is mostly pure metal, which the show is also derived from, which led me flabbergasted, as such a thing would never exist to infect innocent people and usurp people\'s lives. But hey, it\'s all fiction, why should it matter if the author decides to make rust a plague? It is an issue because there are plenty of things that I feel like that are overlooked by the author when he made this. If such a thing called rust wind exists, then people who are venturing are not wearing armour that is resistant to rust, which I\'m not seeing here. Why aren\'t the people using metal sacrifice to protect themselves from rust? Does the show has never heard of the term \'electroplating\'? I believe all the chemist professionals happened to die on that day.It\'s not only the fact that it\'s severely illogical in terms of its setting but how the author decided to introduce a cure right off the bat that can supposedly \'eat\' rust, which then again is just a way to turn it into a prophecy. The approach of having a certain cure where there are already things proven to prevent corrosion of metal or even the show\'s main threat, rust is beyond me. I could not believe it myself.Enough about the stupid lore, now the story. The story is without a doubt inconsistent and convoluted. In the first few episodes, I was not liking how the show was reluctant on showing us the action, one of the things I was highly expecting. Their exposition of dialogue bored me to death until the last few minutes when something actually happens. A mushroom spawner can make himself fly because, for some reason, it can launch him and grow instantly without any withdrawal symptoms from it. They both met and decided to find the rare \'Sabikui\', a mushroom that will cure the doctor\'s sister\'s disease that has plagued her body.Then, when the first few episodes were finally over, it decided to turn into an adventure between a goody-two-shoes doctor and a screaming archer who don\'t know where they are heading. From what I can discern from that part, the show shows more interest in going for anything that suits the current tone of the story, no matter how inconsistent and stupid it is. I was genuinely furious when Episode 9 came along, like the author thought he was doing good writing by having us shocked but ended up making more plot conveniences than Dragon Ball Z, a show notorious for its story stretching further because of abundant plot conveniences. The show was so focused on finishing the story it started, everything felt rushed the moment Milo decided to assault the main villain.My next point is about art. There\'s not much to say about it honestly. The characters from an artistic point are not that bad but their art backgrounds don\'t practically stand out much. But I realise that the stupid mushrooms spawning out from Bisco\'s arrows was getting on my nerves as if those are the only things he can do other than screaming and sometimes being a motivational guy when the time is convenient. What had me legitimately done was the Iron Titan, which happened to be the ugliest thing I have seen made in CGI, in which I do not hate CGI animations whatsoever, but damn, I remember the Titan is more disgusting than it being a dangerous threat.Now to the characters, let\'s say that I was not quite fond of the characters in this show. Their choice of dialogue is so awkward and edgy most of the time. Character development seemed to be forced for the sake of the plot. The villain of the story sounds threatening but was nothing more than a side villain who completely sucks. Kurokawa was as uninteresting as he was annoying, who existed only to make the main character die, yes indeed it happened.A prime example of that is Milo, whose personality takes a 180 during the last few episodes after portraying himself as a well-mannered, compassionate and determined person, decided to be like his counterpart who is known to be childish, aggressive and downright dumb most of the time unless the plot decides to make him intelligent. This for some reason, threw me off and had me confused as it doesn’t make any particular sense in the slightest to have this happen.Not only that, the side characters of this show other than the main duo just feels... fake. Pawoo, a lady portrayed as a sexy fighter with rusts on her body seems to be there for the fanservice and nothing else, despite being the main reason for the doctor to go on an adventure in the first place. Even as the plot goes on, I cannot indulge myself with the fact that Pawoo is supposed to be a character and nothing more than an image of lust. The only decent character out of them was Jabi, who had something to say for himself, but yet again, he doesn\'t seem to be anything that amazing where the main character has talked about him. Tirol on the other hand had something, but it was disappointing that she doesn\'t get much attention other than a few particular episodes. In the end, the characters of the show are incredibly poor and easily forgettable.In terms of enjoyment, it felt like my time was wasted on this junk, which successfully fooled me into thinking it\'s an actual good piece of fiction, which it\'s nothing more than trash. I regretted not listening to others who knew what they were getting into, its tendency of pulling out plot conveniences, contradicting characters, forced character development, rushed storytelling, and illogical lore.""I\'m telling you it\'s overrated!""Overall, do not watch this anime in any circumstances. You will regret it. Hence, I end my review about Sabikui Bisco. Also, screw you too, Sabikui Bisco. yes, Sabikui Bisco.

Also, screw you too, Sabikui Bisco.', 'No SpoilersSabuiki Bisco tries its absolute hardest to be this wild crazy mashup of different Shonen tropes and some random idiosyncrasies added into it. I wanted to enjoy this show that was truly nutty as fruitcake which is why I rated it as high as I did. Then we got the 2nd and 3rd episodes which has led to nothing short of a disaster. This is mainly due to borrowed content and garbage character designs, with its biggest Achilles Heel being the superficial inarticulate mind-bogglingly trivial story.Story - 3Dear reader are you interested in a show with a misunderstanding as its main selling point?...Along with unrealistic viruses, terrible pacing and an unappealing cast of characters? Then welcome aboard. Sabuiki Bisco\'s world suffers from a rust problem and we are led to believe that mushrooms are the cause of this unspeakable evil. Well if you have an IQ under 70 you might\'ve believed that. Given we are watching a generic Shonen action anime there is no chance for our protagonist to be a villain. So oh wow guys the virus is actually cured by mushrooms! Who would\'ve thought? The plot is extremely shallow which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. Take Demon Slayer as an example it had a shallow plot yet it was good enough and interesting enough to keep us glued to our seats. This show removes any intrigue it had by just saying: ""Hey so this is basically how the world works stupid viewer, keep watching us weekly now that any mystery available is gone."" So apparently this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic anime and initially I was excited, only to realize that it\'s literally ordinary Tokyo rebuilt with desert surrounding it...Art -5Honestly, not a fan of the art, the character designs look off and everything is pretty poor by 2022 animation standards, I know it\'s a new studio but there\'s a certain lack of polish to the actual characters, the cyberpunk backgrounds look alright to be fair. We get a bunch of clowns dressed up in oddly familiar rabbit heads. Oh, gee where have I seen this one before mate? Ah yes, the absolute garbage Doubt manga that was supposed to be scary but just made me laugh instead. That\'s what the costumes in Sabuiki Bisco made me do. Every character looks off, even the whales in the sky are a ripoff of Re Zero.Sound -7I\'m indifferent to the OST at times it\'s great, at times it\'s normal. The OP is far too over exaggerative for me to enjoy as the singer sounds like she\'s trying to sing death metal to a pop beat which fails epically and leaves me royally upset. Though I don\'t dock points off EDs or OPs that was not pleasant in the slightest.Character - 3Oi mate you thought the story was bad? Wait till you hear about the characters. The MC is a mary sue with zero personality that can single-handedly take down an entire army with a mushroom bow. The doctor character is this nice guy that only cares about the greater good. And to top it all off the main rival is just the doctor\'s sister whose whole personality is misunderstanding the MC which is the most overused trope that I despise. The only ""good"" characters I can speak of are the old man that acts as a mentor and the main villain who actually has a personality.Enjoyment - 4I enjoyed the insanity at the start but over time this eroded (get it? Cause of the rus- ok I\'ll stop) into just slogging through each minute of this dull uninteresting show that tries so damn hard to be different but it becomes different to the point of dullness.Overall - 4If it gets better (which I have serious doubts about) I may change my rating to a 5 or 6 at best but right now this anime has been the most disappointing anime of the season so far.

The thing that i love the most so far about this anime is not the fights or cool characters, but the amazing world building that makes me feel like i'm there. It has one of the coolest worlds ive seen so far in anime thats also pretty original too and i think that if the world building continues the way it is this will be an amazing world worth analyzing and exploring.So far these first 3 episodes have definitely...set up a great start for a story the story is fairly original and new and it has many places that it can go that has compelling characters with compelling motivations and they seem pretty fresh so far they aren't anything super original but they are not generic either.The animation is also pretty good while not top tier it isn't average either it delivers and the background art is actually really amazing along with the fights. There is a little bit to be desired and the art style is a little strange but i kind of like it it gives it it's own feel.The first 3 episodes are a very good start i can't say that they have blown me out of the water, but they are really good and i hope that the new studio Oz can keep it up cause this could turn to be a really good show that feels original with care and attention. set up a great start for a story the story is fairly original and new and it has many places that it can go that has compelling characters with compelling motivations and they seem pretty fresh so far they aren't anything super original but they are not generic either.The animation is also pretty good while not top tier it isn't average either it delivers and the background art is actually really amazing along with the fights.

You might get it from this series.', ""Whether you accept the standards of today's light novel adaptations as they are, we should at least all agree that Sabiuki Bisco attempts to try something different. Rather than high school romances or about a protagonist out to save the world, we get a protagonist trying to find a legendary mushroom with capabilities to devour all rust. This may sound confusing at first but trust me, as the story unfolds, it becomes more clear why Bisco is motivated by his actions. But first, we must ask ourselves if this type of story is worth a follow.Apparently, the light novel series have been quite popular, as...it topped rankings on the Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! list. Watching Sabiuki Bisco gave me a peculiar impression at first because the show itself does have a fascinating world setting. It looks like something out of an apocalyptic video game. What's more curious is Bisco's role of attempting to reverse the land to its previous form with his unique talent. Joining him on his quest is young doctor named Milo Nekoyanagi. If this was described as a two-man party in a game, then Bisco would be the main fighter while Milo acts as support with his invaluable creative medical skills and knowledge. The two may be not alike but their roles compliment each other. It's also shown that deep down, Bisco truly cares about Milo's well-being, more than just for the sake of survival to accomplish his goal.With such a premise, this journey takes our characters across a desolate land filled with dangers. Among the earliest threat they face is no other than Milo's sister, Pawoo. With a strong sense of justice, she is known to track down mushroom terrorists in her line of work. Unfortunately, Bisco is branded as a terrorist despite his real intentions. You can put the pieces together and realize that he's practically a target on her hit list. Indeed, Bisco not only has to deal with just finding the legendary Sabikui but to simply survive. It's no easy task when you realize his reputation and he has to adapt with every circumstance. The anime establishes himself as a survivor who relies on clever tactics, his trusty bow, and natural skills to survive. In retrospect, the anime structures the story as fantasy adventure tale with sci-fi elements and survival concepts.While Bisco is the main protagonist, we can't forget about his loyal companion Milo. With a kind heart and gentle personality, Milo serves as the medic. Trust me, his skills are not only invaluable to Bisco but others they encounter on their journey such as Tirol. He helps the helpless and is the type of person just about anyone can trust. This contrasts a bit compare to Bisco because his reputation has been tarnished. There are very few people he can trust in this story. Unfortunately, the anime's character cast is rather thin in numbers and character development is also limited. We don't even get much background storytelling. There are also some characters that can either excite or irriate you. Tirol falls in this example with her somewhat childish personality. Pawoo also entered the anime with an ambition to hunt down Bisco but you may be surprised her change in attitude later on toward him.Watching Sabiuki Bisco doesn't take a lot of thinking to understand the story. The premise speaks for itself while we follow the journey of two characters on such a dangerous adventure. What may catch you off guard later on in the show is a big change of Bisco himself. It may even provoke the question and fate of the anime altogether. I won't spoil it but do be prepared. However, also do be aware that with 12 episodes, the anime scratches more or less the surface of the story. The anime pulls the trigger to get the most important elements of the story in while not adapting a full tale to tell. It's a common trend in light novel adaptations and I think at this point, we just need to learn and accept it.Alright, I admit. I had to actually look up the studio in charge of handling the adaptation. OZ seems to be a brand new production studio and this serves as their first solo project. Watching this show did impress me on the animation front for the unique quality of its production. It sets the feeling of an apocalyptic world with its barren landscapes and harsh environments. Monster designs are also made to look menacing and something you'd expect in a post-apocalyptic world. Human expressions are also captured with care when watching the emotions of the cast, especially for Milo. Finally, the anime makes a clear point abut rust with its character designs. Bisco is the most prominent example for its crude look that gives him the impressions of a rebel. Having said this, I believe OZ made a strong impression with their first project and look forward to their future.Sabiuki Bisco is a show that I can recommend to others even if it seems unorthodox at first glance. It takes on an unique setting that explores the effects of a hazardous environment. Bisco experiences a journey like no other, especially with the obstacles that stood in his way. With every episode, it felt like the anime kept me at the edge of my seat. So sit back, grab some popcorn, drinks, and enjoy the show. it topped rankings on the Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! list.

It's also shown that deep down, Bisco truly cares about Milo's well-being, more than just for the sake of survival to accomplish his goal.With such a premise, this journey takes our characters across a desolate land filled with dangers. Among the earliest threat they face is no other than Milo's sister, Pawoo. With a strong sense of justice, she is known to track down mushroom terrorists in her line of work. Unfortunately, Bisco is branded as a terrorist despite his real intentions. You can put the pieces together and realize that he's practically a target on her hit list. Indeed, Bisco not only has to deal with just finding the legendary Sabikui but to simply survive. It's no easy task when you realize his reputation and he has to adapt with every circumstance. The anime establishes himself as a survivor who relies on clever tactics, his trusty bow, and natural skills to survive. In retrospect, the anime structures the story as fantasy adventure tale with sci-fi elements and survival concepts.While Bisco is the main protagonist, we can't forget about his loyal companion Milo. With a kind heart and gentle personality, Milo serves as the medic. Trust me, his skills are not only invaluable to Bisco but others they encounter on their journey such as Tirol. He helps the helpless and is the type of person just about anyone can trust. This contrasts a bit compare to Bisco because his reputation has been tarnished. There are very few people he can trust in this story. Unfortunately, the anime's character cast is rather thin in numbers and character development is also limited. We don't even get much background storytelling. There are also some characters that can either excite or irriate you. Tirol falls in this example with her somewhat childish personality. Pawoo also entered the anime with an ambition to hunt down Bisco but you may be surprised her change in attitude later on toward him.Watching Sabiuki Bisco doesn't take a lot of thinking to understand the story. The premise speaks for itself while we follow the journey of two characters on such a dangerous adventure. What may catch you off guard later on in the show is a big change of Bisco himself. It may even provoke the question and fate of the anime altogether. I won't spoil it but do be prepared. However, also do be aware that with 12 episodes, the anime scratches more or less the surface of the story. The anime pulls the trigger to get the most important elements of the story in while not adapting a full tale to tell. It's a common trend in light novel adaptations and I think at this point, we just need to learn and accept it.Alright, I admit. I had to actually look up the studio in charge of handling the adaptation. OZ seems to be a brand new production studio and this serves as their first solo project. Watching this show did impress me on the animation front for the unique quality of its production. It sets the feeling of an apocalyptic world with its barren landscapes and harsh environments. Monster designs are also made to look menacing and something you'd expect in a post-apocalyptic world. Human expressions are also captured with care when watching the emotions of the cast, especially for Milo. Finally, the anime makes a clear point abut rust with its character designs. Bisco is the most prominent example for its crude look that gives him the impressions of a rebel. Having said this, I believe OZ made a strong impression with their first project and look forward to their future.Sabiuki Bisco is a show that I can recommend to others even if it seems unorthodox at first glance. It takes on an unique setting that explores the effects of a hazardous environment. Bisco experiences a journey like no other, especially with the obstacles that stood in his way. With every episode, it felt like the anime kept me at the edge of my seat. So sit back, grab some popcorn, drinks, and enjoy the show."", '""I never liked mushrooms. I just don\'t know why but somehow this anime changed my mind""- A Random User On The MAL WebsiteThroughout years of watching anime, I felt tired of watching shows that do the same old trope over and over again in their own specific genre. I felt tired of series following the same-old goal and have no added substance to their posture. However this show took it\'s own spin and made an original storyline out of it. And I must say...Sabkui Bisco is a RIDICULOUS ANIMEI am currently on Episode 7 of the anime so I have to be careful to not...spoil anything so please bare with me everybody. My review of the anime will be split into certain sections :PLOT: The plot so far across the last 7 episodes or so have a lot of potential. The main goal of the protagonist was weirdly predictable yet so intriguing, the idea with it\'s original spin of determination and hard-work. The main protagonist have a lot of potential and I can\'t wait to see what he does in the future and how he develops throughout the whole course of the story as well.ART: In my opinion, the animation and artwork can be seen quite average sometimes but overall very appealing on the eye. I have no complaints over the character designs of each character forth-showing their their own personality. The studio Oz can be forgiven for this aspect. Trust me, if a top-tier studio adapted this series it would be the talk-of-the-town.SOUND: The music is pretty good actually, no complaints that all. But they should put something that relates to theme of mushrooms instead.CHARACTER: The characters give me depth already. I have no doubt in my mind all of them will achieve their goal. The comedy in certain scenes is top-class  and the character interactions could be on par with some of the best in anime history for what i have seen as an individual.. This really is incredible!ENJOYMENT: After 7 episodes and more for the first season this is the anime I have enjoyed the most in this current season. It gave a ridiculous goal, a ridiculous story, but most of all a genius pathos of mushrooms.""I think I like mushrooms now. Mushrooms are good for you anyway.

Well some of them""Thank you for reading my review on Sabikui Bisco', 'The start of Sabikui Bisco promised a relaxing dumb show with a bunch of random stuff that would leave something to care about after each episode. Sadly, the anime ended up being just as dumb, pointless, and insubstantial as anticipated, while also turning in an unintelligible convoluted attempt to evoke emotions out of nowhere, which derived in forgettable climaxes, emotionless speeches, and vain asspulls.The flaws of the anime are all over the place. The complete premise of it gets denser once it gets further elaborated, being basically the equivalent of a Big Pharma conspiracy, narrating a discourse that not even the most braindead user...of LateStageCapitalism would eat, and amplifying such flaw by not imposing any sort of coherency to the world, since the whole issue can be reduced to a single entity that happens to be ridiculously powerful for no other reason but mind control, and the government being inherently evil. To be frank, there is absolutely no business on the main antagonist to be an unforgivable piece of shit, but here we are, a world when even the antagonist knows that he is doing extremely unethical stuff for personal gain, totally credible, purposeful, and stimulating.The characterization issues get even worse, the two main characters are tropes with legs, they can be reduced as a bishounen moral compass that do dumb exposition speeches and a full of testosterone red-haired hero that acts like the embodiment of what is cool for a 5 years old. The conflict between the two characters is as predictable as one could think too, one of the characters wants to make a self-sacrifice to protect the other and the other comes from nowhere to almost save him. The fact that such relation happened more than three times speaks volume about the originality or complexity of the situations, almost as like every single point of creativity was burned to throw darts to the Wikipedia page of Mammals.The side characters are atrocious too, the anime features Pawoo, a random badass girl that is supposed to be the motivation of Milo and is meant to portray a change of beliefs to propose one of the main themes, skepticism. That obviously doesn’t work, the story completely forgot the importance and weight of the supposed conspiracy to allow her to change her heart in a matter of minutes after watching some character trying to sacrifice itself for the other, almost like the conspiracy itself didn’t have any sort of depth. Another character is Tirol, a plot device that also happens to have a hack sad backstory and a desire to have friends, an extremely relatable situation for the average viewer of anime, point that never get further than a “We are now friends” by Milo. The anime also features Iroh from Avatar escaping from a jail and appearing out of nowhere all the time as a gag (So funny!), and some random kids and ethnicities to portray the variety of the world and the dissemination of evilness, oh lord. At no point of the story these side characters add anything to the storyline other than time filling and creating apparent motivations for the main duo, motivations that could pretty much intactly exist by changing every single aspect of their characterization, and even be better if they stripped down their absurd tendency to appear out of nowhere, they are just terribly irrelevant to any sort of progression.Not content with the characters being either irrelevant or unoriginal, the plotline starts making less sense as it goes forward. The first episodes created the foundations to a full of energy adventure, with extreme action and ridiculous events. What did we get? A fourth episode where they domesticate a crab, a fifth episode about some orphans and some creepy couple, a sixth episode about a character that have a forced sad backstory and trust issues. While some of the middle episodes had an interesting value as episodic adventures, those three episodes did absolutely nothing for the overall progression, so when the heat comes, we get the most pathetic anticlimactic intent to make something out of thin air, as everything was crammed to the last half. Honestly, if one “I love you” sounds completely out of place then the story obviously failed at building a credible relationship, fact.To end the mess of a plot, the final episodes had the most room temperature approach to the phrase “You only die when you are forgotten”. To portray that, the anime sequentially uses all the characters that it introduced before and relate them to the memories and values initially enforced by the dead character. While doing that, one of the main characters start to talk like the deceased character to reinforce the idea of our actions having consequence on the others. This sequence of cringe is just pure desperation, the message was conveyed correctly initially, but the approach got ridiculously annoying and redundant after 5 minutes, almost like they didn’t trust the viewers to understand it. The whole episodes turned into a succession of: Fight -> Danger -> Asspull -> Saving -> Next Fight. To add salt to the wound, one of the episodes took notes from Mr. Peak Fiction Isayama and revived the character anyways (Now with superpowers so the whole issue can be solved!), so the whole struggle was just to propose that already badly executed message, thanks!Happily, the anime is not completely unredeemable. One of the most valuable aspects of the show is that it never feels like it is going in cruise mode, which is potentially a bad thing, because the story sucks, but a good thing, because it spices up a lot some moments. The refreshing dumb action scenes, the diverse, immersive, mood-setting soundtrack, the well-done construction of the scenarios. The effort in terms of being it visually vibrant was achieved, and the CGI was most of the time passable, because the anime doesnt really look that good anyways. If the anime was meant to be able to build the mesh between CGI and 2D from the studio, then it is a good effort, it doesn’t look polished, at all, but at least is an interesting product from that perspective.As a conclusion, the anime lacks any kind of overarching intent, it is just a set of fluff being put one after another where the viewer is supposed to infer that something happened in the in-betweens to make some sense about the behavior of the character. The best way to summarize this anime is “hippos mounts, big mushrooms, so random XD” of LateStageCapitalism would eat, and amplifying such flaw by not imposing any sort of coherency to the world, since the whole issue can be reduced to a single entity that happens to be ridiculously powerful for no other reason but mind control, and the government being inherently evil.

I was won over by the soundtrack and how easily it elevated any fight scene it got used in. Bisco is a hot headed protagonist which is better than the usually morally obsessed crybaby main character that is often seen instead, and yet there wasn't really much to any of the characters. The antagonist was annoying, and only appealed to me because he was graced by the voice talent of Kenjirou Tsuda. Honestly, they should have just gotten rid of him early...on and introduced a better threat. It sort of pains me to dig into this series this way, but I can only take so many obnoxious fake out deaths that felt they dragged on the story, and character models getting rocked back and forth rather than being adequately animated. By the end, the finale didn't do anything for me anymore. Though I really do like the soundtrack to this and the way it's used, I can't let it gloss over the fact this adaptation has a lot of problems.The writing in this is laughable, sadly so. The main antagonist could have at any point towards the end easily kill the entire cast if he really wanted to, but conveniently did not go for a show of power when it came to attacking them nearly every time. The amount of damage some of these characters can take and still be able to go on is comical.Besides the great soundtrack, I appreciate how this series tried to be interestingly bizarre. From organic planes to weaponized animals, to giant worms with human limbs and giant floating man eating pufferfish, I did enjoy how out of there they went with this. Milo and Bisco's friendship was fine though often borderline felt like a boys love relationship done on purpose. The romance in this felt laughably unnatural. I liked how the world building started out because this is an interesting post apocalyptical type setting. Despite that it didn't feel satisfying how it was explored. They rushed through places and monsters, and the viewers were left with lots of questions.Milo's character itself isn't anything much besides some typical nice guy who happens to be a doctor. That's what makes him trying to look tough later look forced and not work. More than that it just gave me second hand embarrassment.At first I enjoyed the arrows and their mushroom spawning abilities. Towards the end it felt like a broken skill as nothing really felt like a threat anymore despite Bisco and Milo going up against literally world ending monsters.This adaptation felt too questionable.

But that in itself, isn't a knock on the show. Far from it. Sometimes the most wild of shows, can truly be breathtaking, and special. This really can be one of such. This is the sort of show that Gibiate wishes that it was in fairness. Since both of those shows have a world breaking, or possible world breaking concept, that has to either be dealt with, or explored more.

That\'s even more so for shows that have cool and creative post-apocalyptic worlds that are a dime a dozen, especially for those Mad Max-esque sand-blast wasteland worlds from Trigun; Now and Then, Here and There to the more recent hit of Deca-Dence. And to properly describe what newbie novelist Shinji Cobkubo has done with Sabikui Bisco, is anything BUT simple. And being the very first LN to rank No. 1 in Takarajimasha\'s Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! a.k.a ""This...Light Novel is Amazing!"" annual guide book back in 2018, it\'s safe to say that an anime adaptation of this is pertinent at any point, and we got it, courtesy of some very notable people that I\'ll explain down the line as we go.If you look at ANN\'s interview done with creator Shinji Cobkubo, series composer Sadayuki Murai and director Atsushi Ikariya, it\'s actually very interesting to know how Sabikui Bisco was conceived and brought to life by some of the most talented people in the staff team. Shinji Cobkubo states that this is his first time writing a novel, and being an amateur, he\'s gotta weigh all the factors when considering the story and the world-building that\'s never yet seen before, but striving in all ways to give the comforting feeling of “something you haven\'t but also have seen before” with the sense and joy of discovery. He also knows that plotting and narrative structure are his weak points, and thus the anime prominently showed where Cobkubo himself have faltered (more towards the final stretch). But more than anything, he never once felt agnoized about it and the reception that it would receive, and where the story went, is how Cobkubo will drive that narrative despite of the issues. And for someone being raised by timeless stories like Makoto Shiina\'s sci-fi novel Ad Bird, Buronson\'s Hokuto no Ken a.k.a Fist of the North Star and Hirohiko Araki\'s Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, his work that was perceived as as a ""counter"" to the trends. That presented an opportunity for him to concoct a story that while ""counter""-ing trends, respects the stories that use that narrative to run for years on end to create fun for the readers, which yes my man indeed, Sabikui Bisco IS the definition of fun.But let\'s hold up and go back to the beginning of Sabikui Bisco\'s foundations. Set in a post-apocalyptic world of sand dunes and most particularly Rust, a plague-like wind that decays everything of contact from items to humans, and the origin for this is said to have come from mushroom spores, and unforuntately, people like Mushroom Keepers are mistakenly maligned for being terrorists because they were believed to be the source of the epidemic. And one such Mushroom Keeper goes by the name of Bisco Akaboshi, an archer whom shoots arrows that instantly grows mushrooms, is well-known in the Gunma-Imihama Prefecture with a price on his head. Bisco\'s the infamous Man-Eater, which adds notoriety to his name, and everyone wants a piece of the reward pie for capturing this criminal. On the other side of the spectrum in the city of Imihama, we have Milo Nekoyanagi, a mild-mannered doctor whom does the duties of a doctor of serving the people and finding out the reason for the Rusting disease by cutting deals with the government and secretly buying mushrooms on the black market to save the Captain of the Imihama Watch, Pawoo, who\'s his older sister, also infected by Rusting. The two meet out of coincidence, and amidst all the propaganda made from concealing information with a territorial mindset with closed walls and border inspections, and as such, together with another Mushroom Keeper (Jabi) and Bisco\'s transport animal Actagawa the crab, set out on a journey to find the legendary Rust-Eater (Sabikui) Mushroom, which is said to be the All-Cure to this lingering disease.And for two, how Shinji Cobkubo develops this story and narrative, there\'s a lot of references to be had. There\'s the obvious tense of religious depiction, and Cobkubo places both Buddhism and Hindu mythology as a motif to drive the story, which actually complements sci-fi and fictional religions, and is a cinch to create. That\'s why the anime displayed many of these such motifs from the animals and creatures used as weapons, something that is very unconventional for AniManga standards.In terms of characterization, Bisco and Milo have a relationship that is dubbed hot-blooded ""Shonen manga"" like quality, so the idea of love is something that at first glance, seems like an odd choice of input, that gradually turns into character traits all on its own. Going back to the religious motifs, Bisco is his own man, he trusts himself with the actions he\'s done, and that\'s how he values his own ""faith"". And on the topic of love (as seen in the anime\'s final quarter), this may look off-putting, but it actually derives from Shinji Cobkubo\'s own life experience, where human beings decide to sacrifice their lives to attain something greater, that is their most shining and beautiful moment, and deep from his heart, this is his moment of extol to signify that ""love"". And nowhere is it more prominent than Bisco and Milo, more than treading though every trouble at corners loose, their bonds ever growing as the series progresses on, embodying that ""love"" as a sacrifice and protection of all the things they hold dear. Even to the antagonist that is the Imihama Prefecture Governor Kurokawa, his fight as means of a stranglehold on the region with an iron-clad fist, employng bunny-masked enforcers to carry out his will, that is also ""love"", even when faced with adversity to confront Bisco and Milo, knowing that all the power and control that he had was just a pretense of an act. This also trickles donw to other characters like Pawoo, Jabi and Tirol, they are tied by strong love as partners, teacher and disciple, and siblings, with responsiblity at their necks as they act according to their own principles. It\'s certainly a work of art that\'s different from what you\'d expect to see.Given director Atsushi Ikariya\'s effort on this as his first directorial debut from being character designer and animation director of acclaimed series like Fate/Zero and ID:Invaded, Shinji Cobkubo\'s light novel was certainly something else, more akin to a Mad Max-like premise. Add to that, there\'s the lore of unique things from mushrooms to huge creatures and even pseudo-fusions of machine and organism (i.e. escargot aircraft), which adds nonsensical WTH moments that only adds to the fun. Animals are notoriously difficult to animate, and Ikariya has to consult newcomers to actually help him realize the vision of the series on screen. Not to mention that Sabikui Bisco is rife with a lot of real life references, such as the Black Hawk helicopters drawing experience from war films like Black Hawk Down, handguns from Italian mafia films, and even Terminator references (the most famous one will be the iconic ""I\'ll Be Back"" catchphrase). Along with series composer Sadayuki Murai\'s solid scriptwriting to avoid confusion for the viewer, and technically Shinji Cobkubo\'s story is mostly untouched with almost all of the settings intact, translated into anime of the fullest potential.Also, while new studio OZ was commissioned to produce this show, most of it actually came from the co-production from another studio, NAZ. Remember that I mentioned about ID:Invaded? That series is completely produced by NAZ, and it\'s no wonder that some staff came back to help produce this show, from the likes of color designer Emi Chiba, animation director Ai Asari, key animator Daisuke Mataga, to even director Atsushi Ikariya himself. Needless to say that Atsushi Ikariya really made use of all his experience to flesh Sabikui Bisco out as this weird-rando post-apocalyptic world of endless possibilities that doesn\'t detract and betray the source material.This high-octane action also delivers in the music category, and it\'s a bomb blast of insane proportions. Sound director Kisuke Koizumi is a man of insanity, having produced music for series like The God of High School and Shadows House, and his role in Sabikui Bisco is nothing short of amazing. While JUNNA\'s OP song does fit the overall narrative, on its own I find it to be a bit lackluster and something that is not of her standards, so this is a miss for her. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Bisco and Milo\'s VA-centric ED song, and that is really where the banger goes to make such a compelling ending song that retains all of the tension of the episodes. And if you think that wasn\'t enough, there is a version of the ED with just Milo\'s VA Natsuki Hanae\'s vocals, and that was purposefully made for a section of the anime that had death flags thrown boldly and wittingly.Even with its missteps, Sabikui Bisco is a source that is very ambitious in what Shinji Cobkubo is trying to concoct, that with the anime, Atsushi Ikariya makes this ambition grow exponentially times infinity. And when will be the end of that madness, we will never know since the LN for this is quite the ride that\'s still ongoing, and with the anime, people are noticing that this work actually exists. If anything, I hope that this won\'t be the last time that we\'ll see of Sabikui Bisco, the one true dark horse of the season that is one hell of a roller-coaster ride. Definitely gonna slide into the LN to see what the hoopla is all about, and see if this holds up. It\'s an acquired taste for sure that feels niche, when it\'s not. Light Novel is Amazing!"" annual guide book back in 2018, it\'s safe to say that an anime adaptation of this is pertinent at any point, and we got it, courtesy of some very notable people that I\'ll explain down the line as we go.If you look at ANN\'s interview done with creator Shinji Cobkubo, series composer Sadayuki Murai and director Atsushi Ikariya, it\'s actually very interesting to know how Sabikui Bisco was conceived and brought to life by some of the most talented people in the staff team. Shinji Cobkubo states that this is his first time writing a novel, and being an amateur, he\'s gotta weigh all the factors when considering the story and the world-building that\'s never yet seen before, but striving in all ways to give the comforting feeling of “something you haven\'t but also have seen before” with the sense and joy of discovery. He also knows that plotting and narrative structure are his weak points, and thus the anime prominently showed where Cobkubo himself have faltered (more towards the final stretch). But more than anything, he never once felt agnoized about it and the reception that it would receive, and where the story went, is how Cobkubo will drive that narrative despite of the issues. And for someone being raised by timeless stories like Makoto Shiina\'s sci-fi novel Ad Bird, Buronson\'s Hokuto no Ken a.k.a Fist of the North Star and Hirohiko Araki\'s Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, his work that was perceived as as a ""counter"" to the trends. That presented an opportunity for him to concoct a story that while ""counter""-ing trends, respects the stories that use that narrative to run for years on end to create fun for the readers, which yes my man indeed, Sabikui Bisco IS the definition of fun.But let\'s hold up and go back to the beginning of Sabikui Bisco\'s foundations. Set in a post-apocalyptic world of sand dunes and most particularly Rust, a plague-like wind that decays everything of contact from items to humans, and the origin for this is said to have come from mushroom spores, and unforuntately, people like Mushroom Keepers are mistakenly maligned for being terrorists because they were believed to be the source of the epidemic. And one such Mushroom Keeper goes by the name of Bisco Akaboshi, an archer whom shoots arrows that instantly grows mushrooms, is well-known in the Gunma-Imihama Prefecture with a price on his head. Bisco\'s the infamous Man-Eater, which adds notoriety to his name, and everyone wants a piece of the reward pie for capturing this criminal. On the other side of the spectrum in the city of Imihama, we have Milo Nekoyanagi, a mild-mannered doctor whom does the duties of a doctor of serving the people and finding out the reason for the Rusting disease by cutting deals with the government and secretly buying mushrooms on the black market to save the Captain of the Imihama Watch, Pawoo, who\'s his older sister, also infected by Rusting. The two meet out of coincidence, and amidst all the propaganda made from concealing information with a territorial mindset with closed walls and border inspections, and as such, together with another Mushroom Keeper (Jabi) and Bisco\'s transport animal Actagawa the crab, set out on a journey to find the legendary Rust-Eater (Sabikui) Mushroom, which is said to be the All-Cure to this lingering disease.And for two, how Shinji Cobkubo develops this story and narrative, there\'s a lot of references to be had. There\'s the obvious tense of religious depiction, and Cobkubo places both Buddhism and Hindu mythology as a motif to drive the story, which actually complements sci-fi and fictional religions, and is a cinch to create. That\'s why the anime displayed many of these such motifs from the animals and creatures used as weapons, something that is very unconventional for AniManga standards.In terms of characterization, Bisco and Milo have a relationship that is dubbed hot-blooded ""Shonen manga"" like quality, so the idea of love is something that at first glance, seems like an odd choice of input, that gradually turns into character traits all on its own. Going back to the religious motifs, Bisco is his own man, he trusts himself with the actions he\'s done, and that\'s how he values his own ""faith"". And on the topic of love (as seen in the anime\'s final quarter), this may look off-putting, but it actually derives from Shinji Cobkubo\'s own life experience, where human beings decide to sacrifice their lives to attain something greater, that is their most shining and beautiful moment, and deep from his heart, this is his moment of extol to signify that ""love"". And nowhere is it more prominent than Bisco and Milo, more than treading though every trouble at corners loose, their bonds ever growing as the series progresses on, embodying that ""love"" as a sacrifice and protection of all the things they hold dear. Even to the antagonist that is the Imihama Prefecture Governor Kurokawa, his fight as means of a stranglehold on the region with an iron-clad fist, employng bunny-masked enforcers to carry out his will, that is also ""love"", even when faced with adversity to confront Bisco and Milo, knowing that all the power and control that he had was just a pretense of an act. This also trickles donw to other characters like Pawoo, Jabi and Tirol, they are tied by strong love as partners, teacher and disciple, and siblings, with responsiblity at their necks as they act according to their own principles. It\'s certainly a work of art that\'s different from what you\'d expect to see.Given director Atsushi Ikariya\'s effort on this as his first directorial debut from being character designer and animation director of acclaimed series like Fate/Zero and ID:Invaded, Shinji Cobkubo\'s light novel was certainly something else, more akin to a Mad Max-like premise. Add to that, there\'s the lore of unique things from mushrooms to huge creatures and even pseudo-fusions of machine and organism (i.e. escargot aircraft), which adds nonsensical WTH moments that only adds to the fun. Animals are notoriously difficult to animate, and Ikariya has to consult newcomers to actually help him realize the vision of the series on screen. Not to mention that Sabikui Bisco is rife with a lot of real life references, such as the Black Hawk helicopters drawing experience from war films like Black Hawk Down, handguns from Italian mafia films, and even Terminator references (the most famous one will be the iconic ""I\'ll Be Back"" catchphrase). Along with series composer Sadayuki Murai\'s solid scriptwriting to avoid confusion for the viewer, and technically Shinji Cobkubo\'s story is mostly untouched with almost all of the settings intact, translated into anime of the fullest potential.Also, while new studio OZ was commissioned to produce this show, most of it actually came from the co-production from another studio, NAZ. Remember that I mentioned about ID:Invaded? That series is completely produced by NAZ, and it\'s no wonder that some staff came back to help produce this show, from the likes of color designer Emi Chiba, animation director Ai Asari, key animator Daisuke Mataga, to even director Atsushi Ikariya himself. Needless to say that Atsushi Ikariya really made use of all his experience to flesh Sabikui Bisco out as this weird-rando post-apocalyptic world of endless possibilities that doesn\'t detract and betray the source material.This high-octane action also delivers in the music category, and it\'s a bomb blast of insane proportions. Sound director Kisuke Koizumi is a man of insanity, having produced music for series like The God of High School and Shadows House, and his role in Sabikui Bisco is nothing short of amazing. While JUNNA\'s OP song does fit the overall narrative, on its own I find it to be a bit lackluster and something that is not of her standards, so this is a miss for her. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Bisco and Milo\'s VA-centric ED song, and that is really where the banger goes to make such a compelling ending song that retains all of the tension of the episodes. And if you think that wasn\'t enough, there is a version of the ED with just Milo\'s VA Natsuki Hanae\'s vocals, and that was purposefully made for a section of the anime that had death flags thrown boldly and wittingly.Even with its missteps, Sabikui Bisco is a source that is very ambitious in what Shinji Cobkubo is trying to concoct, that with the anime, Atsushi Ikariya makes this ambition grow exponentially times infinity.

It\'s an acquired taste for sure that feels niche, when it\'s not.', ""I can't think of an anime in the last ten years that has evoked this kind of emotion from me and not in the way they intended it. I feel so angry and disappointed,  disgusted and appalled. I hate that I'll never get all those hours I spent watching this show back. I literally got to the 10th episode and I just had to stop cause I couldn't keep forcing myself to toll with the bullsh*t. Literally 2 episode left to the end and I physically couldn't force myself to keep going cause it finally clicked that this anime isn't gonna get any better....Trust me the moment you find yourself telling yourself to push on and that it'll get better down the line, stop cause it won't.The writing and plot progression is honestly the worst I've ever seen. All the characters literally have the IQ of a walnut. At moments where even a squirrel could figure out what the best course of action would be, the characters constantly choose the most braindead actions and then you're expected to feel shocked or surprised or sad when their dumb choices come to bite them in the ass in the end.Minor spoilers ahead. Like I've never seen a villain as easy to kill that somehow lasted as long as they did. Literally all four of the main good guys have the power to end the villain with a whistle but at every possible turn when they literally have him on the ropes and coughing out gallons of blood, when he's literally at his most vulnerable while they're still pretty ok, THEY LET HIM GET AWAY. And of course this causes them issues in the future. I honestly thought maybe the villain was pulling a bondrewd and had multiple bodies so even if you killed one he'd show up again but nope, every single time he was right in front of them it was the real him and I couldn't for the life of me understand just why they couldn't just get rid of him.The characters themselves are so bland and generic it's almost impossible to fall in love with or take any sort of interest in them. They're all just a mosh of all the generic tropes you can think of. And not even the good ones. I hate that the show leaned so much on quite possibly the worst trope in existence: the misunderstanding.Spoilers ahead potentiallyThen the asspulls oh my god it's what got to me in the end.  Oh is a giant mecha robot that's been dead for decades running rsmpant in your town? Don't worry here's a pristine fresh off the press manual that details everything about it. Oh are you a frail petite skinny city boy doctor that's probably never done any intensive exercise in your life? Don't worry in tw weeks you'll be shooting arrows through a fly's butthole, mixing potions and scaling towers, all things I supposedly had to undergo gruesome training for but don't worry you won't have to do all that, it'll just come to you. Oh are we stranded somewhere we've both never been to? Don't worry I'm sure there's a convenient clean cottage out here on the plain with a working gas cooker and television so we can hear the bad guy's public broadcast where he publicly tortures an officer of the law and threatens with death publicly.Don't even get me started on the animation. Literally 2022 and an anime that came out in the 90s has better animation. And you know that's what i was coming for. I didn't expect it to be the next aot or anything, i just wanted something like demon slayer with a basic plot and some good fights to keep me watching but all I got was garbageThe show is a contrived, convoluted mess.

Unlike Kill La Kill (which is a mediocre show, but was ironically...throwing jabs at clichés of common Seinen anime of the time), Sabikui Bisco generally treats itself seriously as if anyone could seriously empathize with this nonsense. It literally goes as far as creating its' own little lamplight NON-ironically (in 2022, imagine that).You would assume from the trailer that it's an action packed show with explosions, and you will be wrong. Generally fights are short (budget issues maybe?), one dimensional and have no sense of danger, like a theme park ride. An enemy appears, they shoot mushroom arrows at it and it explodes eventually. 6 episodes in and that's all it ever was.Are the characters any good at least? Of course not, they are so cliché it makes me cringe. The typical tropes are all here in full health.The angsty angry red haired protagonist with super powers, the shy quiet kind feminine partner and the quirky rogue-ish girl to help them out in a pinch.While they have tried to add growth to them, dialogues are a choir to listen to and nothing memorable happens.Generally I feel like it could be a show similar to the 90's Trigun and it has EVERYTHING for that comparison, but the execution is poor and where Trigun has plenty of actually funny moments, while still making you feel attached to the characters and their deaths, this show misses the mark too much to have anything redeeming for itself.As someone who likes post-apocaliptic stories, movies and anime, which frankly are somewhat rare, I still dropped it as I had the feeling of wasting my time.If the Studio and those responsible keep growing, they have potential in the future to create an impressive product, but sadly this one is not it.Sabikui Bisco is a very mediocre and recycled show and I find that disappointing. throwing jabs at clichés of common Seinen anime of the time), Sabikui Bisco generally treats itself seriously as if anyone could seriously empathize with this nonsense.

Even after 5 episodes, each episode is still jam packed with action and animated consistently.Sound directing is straightforward, and the music has a good variety. Giant monsters or destruction will always have louder volume to emphasize its largeness. Metal, rock, synth and jazz were blasted right when action...starts.The storytelling although straightforward and barbaric most of the time, it is laced with dark themes to keep it grounded.If you can keep up with the speed and wackiness, and also the unpleasant personalities, it will be obvious that they're all intended, and they're all part of what makes this anime so much fun. starts.The storytelling although straightforward and barbaric most of the time, it is laced with dark themes to keep it grounded.If you can keep up with the speed and wackiness, and also the unpleasant personalities, it will be obvious that they're all intended, and they're all part of what makes this anime so much fun."", ""After watching it, I don't really know whay I am liking this series, all I can say is that both Bisco and pandas' duo is very good and their adventure felt refreshing for some reasons. Post-apoclyptic wolrd is very good take with the combination of some wierd turtle mountain and snail helicopter(i think that what I would call them) creatures and some hippos and a very understanding crab pet.

I didn't finish for a long time after watching episode 9 but came back to finish the last 4 episodes at 1.5 x speed just to say I finished it. The last four episodes were as dissapointing as I was expecting them to be, and really lacked the whimsical elements of the first 9 that had me hooked at first.Best thing about this anime was...the world building.

However I just felt the pacing was off like you are made to feel something exciting will happen but completely misses the mark at becoming interesting. It feels like a copycat of shounen already been done but more confusing to what the characters were doing.

I suppose that is the theme of this review, post-apocalyptic absurdism is now literary realism. The joke is on us.Characters 2/10Bisco himself is cool enough. He\'s strong and dumb, borderline invincible and emotionally unavailable. The perfect foil for a sensitive ""good guy"" sidekick.

Unfortunately there was very little rattling going on here.Doctor Panda is more of a problem, levelling up from pathetic weakling to giga-chud with very little coaxing.

I kind of liked the moonlighting prostitute jack of all trades girl, but she\'s sidelined fairly early on. I gave this section a 2 since there\'s really only 2 characters. And neither of them are particularly interesting.Plot 1/10Crazy lore for a 12 episode series, suspension of disbelief is required for viewing. Luckily for me (not being anal about rationalism, even in real life) I can accept a world of rust eating mushrooms and gigantic crabs. What I can\'t accept, however, is a story that relies on piss weak character motivations. If you are going to be absurd, at least have some conviction!Big Bad is a capitalist, duh, but a nonsensical one. Here\'s a pop quiz for the young left-leaning readers amongst us: do we suppose that our ideological opponents are maliciously motivated by personal gain? Or are they perhaps misguided in their notion of the ""greater good""? Even this bee\'s dick of nuance is already a cliché at this point. Big Bad wants to spread disease so that he can sell the cure, but simply selling the cure will already make him rich enough for one lifetime. So his motivation must be different then, he must be hoping to control what\'s left of this society. To what end? To keep the population down for ecological reasons? To prevent a second apocalypse? These would be the ""reasons why"" a misguided person might mistakenly commit evil. But Big Bad is not misguided, he\'s just evil. Ok, so does he want to wipe out the human race? No, he just wants to get personally rich... See the loop we are on? He is too evil to be merely motivated by gain, he ultimately has no motive. He exists to give our heroes someone to fight. But do they even have a reason to fight?Bisco and the old man must cross a border and a city to find the rust eater mushroom. During this crossing they disguise as a new religious sect (which is never mentioned again). So they\'ve crossed the assumedly endless border wall, with a vast dessert around them. Must we suppose the city itself is similarly impassable? Why couldn\'t they go around? Because they needed to pick up the deuteragonist, obviously! Ok, so Bisco plunges straight through the enemy encampment, losing old man in the process. Earning himself some emotional baggage and an effeminate side kick. Now we have 50 episodes or so of world-building adventures, building up the characters and establishing the lore... wait, none of that happens? They just save some kids and start a bromance? Ok, whatever floats your crab.Regarding said bromance, the word ham-fisted does not do it justice. Characters decide to like one another so arbitrarily and unconvincingly. Why should doctor boy like prostitute girl? Because she fixed the train? These characters literally just learned each other\'s names as they say goodbye, adding that they\'ll never forget each other. Have you ever got to that level of affection before learning someone\'s name? And why is g-cup suddenly dtf with Bisco? And why does doctor boy physically attack Bisco to prevent him coming to harm?People accuse Demon Slayer of being dumb, but at least it knows that it\'s dumb! This series made the mistake of attempting something so far beyond its capabilities. Or maybe it didn\'t, maybe it was a heartless cash grab from the start. Maybe an AI wrote this plot.Design 7/10The reason why I watched Bisco to begin with. It looked cool. Mushrooms are cool, crabs are cool, rusted boobas are cool. But cool is just the packaging. Inside the technicolor wonderland of Bisco resides an amorphous mass of contradictions and clichés (not to mention an FDA approved minimum percentage of human feces). If you scratch the shiny surface even just a little, the surging cry of a missing chromosome will assault your senses. This show is developmentally challenged, falling short of the mark at every turn. But somehow so consistently flawed that it seems to fail organically, as if it was God\'s mistake for allowing humanity to live this long. This show somehow possesses a Milton-esque level of tragic irony, turning the viewer against existence itself. In the end we take up arms with Satan, pitying his cruel banishment, and march upon the heavens with righteous indignation! Why give us rusty boobas if we aren\'t given motivation to squeeze? What fresh hell is this?!ConclusionRacism. but there\'s nothing wrong with clichés if you can rattle them around enough. Unfortunately there was very little rattling going on here.Doctor Panda is more of a problem, levelling up from pathetic weakling to giga-chud with very little coaxing. If your anime is only 12 episodes long, best to focus on a tight-ass plot rather than character maturation. Figure out how weak doctor boy becomes essential to the plot and progress from there. He doesn\'t really need to change, he\'s already ""good"".Big booby rust queen has a cool look, but that\'s about all. It doesn\'t really sell the ""debilitating power of rust"" when a terminally ill g-cup can still whoop anybody\'s ass.The lesser characters and the main villain were pretty forgettable. I kind of liked the moonlighting prostitute jack of all trades girl, but she\'s sidelined fairly early on. I gave this section a 2 since there\'s really only 2 characters. And neither of them are particularly interesting.Plot 1/10Crazy lore for a 12 episode series, suspension of disbelief is required for viewing.

I\'m not a reviewer; I\'m simply a normal anime fan. Although this anime has a unique story, the execution and logic are both average. I decided to stop watching after Episode 8. So, in Episode 8, they knock out the enemy boss but don\'t confirm his death; instead, they chitchat and then the boss appears and attacks after a few minutes(at the very least, the Producers could have made it more realistic by having another character revive or heal the boss with some strange mushrooms, or something that\'s logical). I\'m a guy...who sees logic in animes, and my appreciation for it has grown after watching ""Cautious Hero,"" which is full of logic, cautiousness and then there is ""JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure,"" which has the worst logic. So, if you don\'t mind the logic and want to experience a unique story, you can try it. who sees logic in animes, and my appreciation for it has grown after watching ""Cautious Hero,"" which is full of logic, cautiousness and then there is ""JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure,"" which has the worst logic.

Bisco, the main character, isn't anything new, but Milo, Tirol and Jabi are. Not fully new, but they have unique characters that seperates from the common mass of the tropes.Opening and ending ost, great.The problem with the last part is it seemed the author didn't know what to do with the two main characters....Many things that could have been handled a better way, so in the story they would make sense as well, but they were not coherently put together. Also i hate when, for plot reason, they dumb down characters.

I couldn\'t. It took me FOUR MONTHS to go through this and I lived to tell the tale.... of how shit this show is.While Bisco is pounding that Panda bussy, let\'s reflect on the good times.There weren\'t any good times.This show started with a interesting setting but a incredibly stupid premise. A guy fighting ""rust"" with mushrooms. They are really running out of ideas in Japan I tell ya. I tried to do quick research on ""Mushrooms and Rust"" and ended up with results primarily from game Rust and people telling others to not...eat them in Rust.I was hoping to find some connection between Mushrooms and Rust, since I can\'t, I\'m assuming the writer and director were high on shrooms when they came up with this stupid idea.Art is acceptable. I liked the setting, visually. It kinda rips off Mad Max, but that\'s fine. Sound, Music is actually interesting. I found Music to be good but more suitable for some other setting than a stupid Mushroom story.Characters are just fucking terrible. They come out of nowhere, and are forgotten until they are needed for a scene. The merchant girl with a pointless backstory and 2-3 episodes dedicated to her is a good example. Milo (Panda Doctor) is another fucking annoying character that is so weak that he manages to train and perfect archery enough to defeat MC in one episode (drugs were involved). Oh and Panda is ready to give up his bussy for Bisco, he\'s in love.. like in the last 5 episodes (it isn\'t a spoiler, that\'s how it looks from start, even episode is named after it).Speaking of last episodes, they were excruciating to sit through, more than the rest of the show. 12 fucking episodes are never enough to create a world, when you have a new setting, and it shows here perfectly. They rush through setting and characters, rush through their training, introduction and move on. It\'s never worth getting invested in, even the fucking main characters are pretty much just there without any backstory. What is the giant alien thing destroying Japan with Rust? Where did it come from? Where are Mushroom people coming from? Why the fuck would anyone hate them when they obviously are saving people? (they tried to explain it, but it was so stupid) Is Bisco a fucking superhuman? That\'s the fucking impression you get until Panda, a regular human, starts acting like him and taking down giant aliens while being thrown against walls at mach-5. NOTHING IS EXPLAINED OR MAKES SENSE.2/102 for the Pandussy and art. eat them in Rust.I was hoping to find some connection between Mushrooms and Rust, since I can\'t, I\'m assuming the writer and director were high on shrooms when they came up with this stupid idea.Art is acceptable.

The story itself is eh... cool premise, I suppose. But everything can easily be figured out within the first few episodes and then it's just a waiting game from there.There's also some weird sexualisation moments. Nothing too crazy in terms of anime, but Milo falling into his sisters chest was completely unnecessary. As well as his commentary on her cup size. That's your sister, man...Overall, it's good, and interesting for the first few episodes. The soundtrack is great, and the visuals in...the opening are really appealing.

But the story lets it down a fair bit, hoping things improve with another season!"", '*UPDATED AFTER COMPLETING IT*This is my first ever review, so just a heads up if I don\'t do it as well as other people.I will start off with no spoilers and then head into spoilers in a separate paragraph.-NON SPOILERS-The show starts off with incredible mystery in both the plot and in characters. It does a great job in the early episodes of giving you teases and glimpses into the truth of the show. As the characters begin to explore outside of the initial city, you get to see the truth unravel more and and it starts to get real interesting. However, episode 8 the...story goes off the rails and plot points just happen because the writer needs a ""twist"" to happen. To sum up my feelings in a word, it is \'disappointed.\' I will continue to watch this since I\'m only 2 episodes from the end, but I will likely be making fun of it every second of the final 2 episodes.-Updated After the Final 2 Episodes (Non-Spoilers)-The show slightly redeemed itself at the end. There was a plot point, that I get into in the spoiler section, that did piss me off and was a fearful prediction that I had, but the final episode and the final fight was very entertaining and made up for it. I still don\'t think there is anything crazy coming from this show, nothing that makes me say ""Yes you need to watch this!"" but there are some decent points in this show that I can say it\'s an average watch. If you got time and nothing else to watch, give it a try.-SPOILERS-Story (3/10)Yay, I can now talk about the shit show that Sabikui Bisco has become. Like I said in my non spoilers section, this show started off great, and I was thinking that this could rise to my favorite ""small show"" series of this Winter (this was battling with Strongest Sage for my favorite ""small show"" this Winter). I loved the episodes in the city, where Bisco is being called a man-eater and is being hunted, but in reality Bisco is just trying to spread the truth. I also loved how crazy he was because he was liking the fact that, even though it was all a misunderstanding, people were hunting him down. I also liked the look into the kid\'s village and even the rust eater was cool. But man the moment that they go save Pawoo from the office and leave Kurakawa there instead of killing me, that is the moment this show lost me.There was no legitimate reason for them to not kill him there, it was just the fact that the author wanted the plot to continue. I also still have no idea why Kurakawa is keeping any of them alive. He is depicted as a psycho, but in reality he just an idiot. He leaves Jabi alive twice, he leaves Pawoo alive for too long, his decisions just make no sense. Can we also talk about that fact that in that same episode Panda and Bisco are escaping, get shot multiple times, and are some how just fine the next episode. Did the agents not chase them down and make sure they were actually dead?Unfortunately that is not the end of my disappointment, because in the very next episode Bisco literally dies for no good reason. The author first doesn\'t kill off Kurakawa for no good reason, and then kills off your main character for no good reason. For the people reading this, thinking that Bisco\'s death was done well, I heavily disagree. Kurakawa was in a very weak state, a weak enough state that Bisco in his weakened state could completely overpower him and tackle him into the burning rust. You know what else he could have done? Bisco could have just kicked or shoved him into the burning rust and then still lived. It is ridiculous, so much so that I wasn\'t even sad when Bisco died, I was just confused.Then this most recent episode came around and me and my roommate are just laughing at how ridiculous the story telling of this show has become. I also love how this show all of a sudden turns into a Michael Bay movie with all of the explosions that randomly occur. As I talk about the art, sound, characters, and enjoyment, I will keep them short, as I did go long on the story portion.Art (7/10)The art is unique in this, and works well with the action. I don\'t think I have seen an anime yet that reminds me of the art style. It just fits the whole theme of the show.Sound (8/10)This has been the only redeeming factor of this show besides the art. The opening is fun and gets me hyped up for some good action, and the music during the show adds to the tension and action sequences during the episode, even if the tension is pretty terrible due to the poor writing.Character (5/10)This score isn\'t necessarily because I see the characters as bad, because I like the main 4, and I even like Tirol, even if you only see her for a couple episodes. The main reason for this score is because the development makes no sense. Panda, who is just a freaking doctor at the start of this show and has had zero combat experience is now just as strong as a Mushroom Keeper by episode 10. The progress in the character skills just make no sense.Enjoyment (4/10)Because of how random the plot points go, and how random the character strengths go, I just struggle to enjoy this show. The only reason I enjoy this show at all it to make fun of how ridiculous it is.-Concluding Thoughts- (4/10)It is a shame how far this show has come from the the beginning. It went from battling for my top Winter anime, to being the lowest anime I have rated I have completed since The Promised Neverland Season 2. Who knows, they may somehow redeem this show in the final 2 episodes, but if they actually do bring Bisco back to life like my roommate is predicting they will, I will hate it even more...-Updated Review After the Final 2 Episodes-Alright so the final 2 episodes came out and I watched them, and sure enough my fear came true...Bisco came back. Bisco coming back felt so forced, but guess who else came back, KURA-FREAKING-KAWA!!! Like how many times they gotta fucking die! The revival of Bisco felt terrible, but I would be lying to you if I wasn\'t enjoying the final fight. Something that shook me was the fact that they actually confirmed the relationship between Pawoo and Bisco. I had shipped them, but had seen so many other people shipping Panda and Bisco, but NOPE, Pawoo kisses Bisco right before the final fight. The show ended well, and as much as I hated the show overall, the final episode slightly redeemed it. I still cannot rate it any higher than a 5 because of all the plot issues throughout, but it did raise my score up 1 from a 4 to a 5. story goes off the rails and plot points just happen because the writer needs a ""twist"" to happen. To sum up my feelings in a word, it is \'disappointed.\' I will continue to watch this since I\'m only 2 episodes from the end, but I will likely be making fun of it every second of the final 2 episodes.-Updated After the Final 2 Episodes (Non-Spoilers)-The show slightly redeemed itself at the end.

I don\'t think I have seen an anime yet that reminds me of the art style. It just fits the whole theme of the show.Sound (8/10)This has been the only redeeming factor of this show besides the art. The opening is fun and gets me hyped up for some good action, and the music during the show adds to the tension and action sequences during the episode, even if the tension is pretty terrible due to the poor writing.Character (5/10)This score isn\'t necessarily because I see the characters as bad, because I like the main 4, and I even like Tirol, even if you only see her for a couple episodes. The main reason for this score is because the development makes no sense. Panda, who is just a freaking doctor at the start of this show and has had zero combat experience is now just as strong as a Mushroom Keeper by episode 10. The progress in the character skills just make no sense.Enjoyment (4/10)Because of how random the plot points go, and how random the character strengths go, I just struggle to enjoy this show. The only reason I enjoy this show at all it to make fun of how ridiculous it is.-Concluding Thoughts- (4/10)It is a shame how far this show has come from the the beginning. It went from battling for my top Winter anime, to being the lowest anime I have rated I have completed since The Promised Neverland Season 2. Who knows, they may somehow redeem this show in the final 2 episodes, but if they actually do bring Bisco back to life like my roommate is predicting they will, I will hate it even more...-Updated Review After the Final 2 Episodes-Alright so the final 2 episodes came out and I watched them, and sure enough my fear came true...Bisco came back. Bisco coming back felt so forced, but guess who else came back, KURA-FREAKING-KAWA!!! Like how many times they gotta fucking die! The revival of Bisco felt terrible, but I would be lying to you if I wasn\'t enjoying the final fight. Something that shook me was the fact that they actually confirmed the relationship between Pawoo and Bisco. I had shipped them, but had seen so many other people shipping Panda and Bisco, but NOPE, Pawoo kisses Bisco right before the final fight. The show ended well, and as much as I hated the show overall, the final episode slightly redeemed it. I still cannot rate it any higher than a 5 because of all the plot issues throughout, but it did raise my score up 1 from a 4 to a 5.', 'This show is unique. It\'s like watching a little kid cheer that he got his story about snail helicopters greenlit for an anime.I was worried that the ""random animals coming out of nowhere"" gimmick would get old. It did. I\'m surprised it managed to last that long - two thirds of the show - before it got stale.Not sure why people didn\'t pay attention to a Yu Gi Oh card game in the middle of the show, but the writer tries to make it crystal clear that he is willing to sacrifice plot points and believable character interactions for funny fights, cool lines, and...a sprinkle of hot romance. This entire show is about saving the best for stuff you like and leaving the rest to rot. Did they pick an inexperienced animation studio because of this? You gotta admire the commitment.There are two scenes towards the end where the characters are put through a ton of pain. Or so we are led to believe, as it\'s jarring how unconvincingly these characters act. Perhaps the writer was uncomfortable with the viewers getting a thrill from seeing such horrible situations. That would have been a great message, if the writer had alluded to this. But as it stands, these two scenes stick out and drag down an otherwise great experience.The second to last episode drags out a fight for half of it. Normally, I\'d overlook this, but after the Yu Gi Oh gamble and the climax, another mess up makes it three unenjoyable episodes in a row. What annoys me most is that the episodes leading up to the ending can\'t be skipped, so everyone that picks up this show is going to have to sit through a slow, painful death. Until it picks up for the ending! Bisco nails the ending.The show starts off confusing, but doesn\'t stay that way. And if an idiot like me can understand it, the storytelling can\'t be that bad. Music is phenomenal, voice acting is great (especially Kurokawa\'s!), post-apocalyptic art is sexy, originality and coolness are off the charts. It\'ll probably be a decade until people can appreciate the cheesy 3D though.Overall, it\'s an ambitious project that doesn\'t end up being the cult classic it wanted to be, despite its optimistic start. a sprinkle of hot romance.

Its plot and unique powers and world setting and characters are what sets it apart from most anime. However, it is not without its faults... the 1st half was awesome, but like the anime for Midori Days where you enjoy the 1st half and then the plot shifts and changes and the writing and tone are very different that you swear another writer took over, you're then left not liking the plot and changes. In fact, this is where most have an issue with the anime for Sabikui Bisco. The writing becomes cliche and predictable...and even at times bad writing too. In fact, if it hadn't been for the very last episode which explained why and how it was possible for what was happening to be happening, I'd not have been able to even enjoy this anime further and would've been left with a sour taste in my mouth... (Hint: What's explained applies to the other too if you think about it)Now that said, I still say even with the explanation that it was bad writing but if you can accept that and overlook its short comings, you might just like Sabikui Bisco and if nothing else you'll likely love the 1st half. In fact, at its BEST I would've rated this an 8.0, at its worst a 6.0 but thanks to that last episode which was awesome (Not just due to the explanation but most of the episode itself), Sabikui Bisco gets a 7.0 rating from me. Typically that means its average, but honestly no, this series is far from average (Minus most of the 2nd half which is largely cliche and predictable) and seeing as the LN is continuing and the manga got a sequel, hopefully in a few years time we'll get a 2nd season which covers the rest of the series.Special shout out to the art which is awesome and the colors used which further improves the art and ofc, the English Dub and the VA too as they did a PERFECT JOB making this anime come to life. While I haven't heard the Japanese version of the anime, I can't see how the Japanese VA can do it better than the English Dub VA did and that's not something I typically say. (Most are equal I feel in their acting and voices for the cast of characters) It just goes to show how GREAT the English Dub VA are, how perfect they are for these characters in terms of the characters' voice and how well they nailed it. With all that said, give Sabikui Bisco a chance, you might just be glad you did. Oh and one more thing, Pawoo and the nameless blonde prostitute are best girls :) (A shame at the time of this writing, none of the Prostitutes have their own character page on MAL despite showing up often enough to be supporting characters) and even at times bad writing too.

Sci-fi? Post Apocalyptic? Desert-Punk style? Bow and Arrow fights? It's got it all and more. I randomly bumped into this anime when I was browsing around Crunchyroll looking at new shows out and coming soon. Saw the title card, read the premise, and said “let's give it the 5 ep test” (to an empty room, it was just me there.)Quick note for those not familiar with this sort of test. A lot of anime watchers have an episode limit to see if they will continue a...show, usually ranging from 3-5 episodes. If the show hasn’t grabbed them by then, well, no hard feelings but they’re moving on. My test used to be 3 eps but my friend's hard logic got me to adopt his 5 ep test.So here we are, it’s been 5 episodes of Sabikui Bisco.Does it pass the 5-Episode test?: Yes it does!This show is just fun y'all! I mean read the synopsis from MyAnimeList; you’re going to see a hero who rides a giant crab and shoots arrows that sprout into giant mushrooms.It really is shaping up to be a good anime. I won’t get spoilery in this review but from episode one we meet the majority of the main characters and are introduced fairly shortly after that to a classic “going on a journey/quest” plotline, where the main characters have a bunch of mishaps, adventures, bumps, and laughs along the way.It’s got a good cast of characters and I haven’t found anyone I particularly dislike. The dynamics work well and there's good development happening so far. The action is fun and fast with good, creative fights and very interesting world-building happening in almost every episode. The creators are definitely having fun with this one.The only time thing I’ve had that was a slight drawback was that there's a decent amount going on so this last episode they rushed through a plot that I thought could have been developed more and would have been fun to see be a little longer. That however is probably just my personal taste.So in conclusion, if you’re looking for a new show to check out and you like Action Anime with a Desert Punk style you will love this one.

Unfortunately, this series failed to live up to my expectations.  It did present the unique story, interesting characters, and so on, but ended up being a rather odd progression towards its ending, and by the end, I was left sort of disappointed that this unique world and characters was wasted.  That being said, I did relatively enjoy it week to week, and apparently it is getting a S2, which I would definitely look out...for simply due to its world, which I love.Animation 9/10-  Love the presentation, character designs and world design are enticing.Sound 7/10-  Decent sound design, ok OP/ED, good VA work.  Love Pawoo character.Story 6/10-  I wanted more out of this story, it just seemed incoherent.Characters 7/10-  Unique characters, great design, the baddies were weak though, which made the story weak by proxy.Enjoyment 7/10-  Nothing to write home about, but due to the uniqueness of the anime, I felt myself not having trouble watching week to week.If you are looking for something different, that isn't a banger, but just an okay anime to pass some time, then Sabikui Bisco can be that title to indulge in.  If you got a list of anime on your to do list, then I'd skip this one, there are a lot better anime out there. for simply due to its world, which I love.Animation 9/10-  Love the presentation, character designs and world design are enticing.Sound 7/10-  Decent sound design, ok OP/ED, good VA work.

I had no idea about its source material when I somehow stumbled upon it. After some brief research, I decided to give it a watch and decide if this was truly worth a watch. And believe me, I loved it from the first episode itself! For a new studio, OZ has done a great job. This show has everything you normally expect from an action-adventure shounen based on a manga: exciting action, journeys to picturesque lands, heartwarming friendships and a terrific lead character.While I felt the CGI for the...crab could have been better, the writing alone is so good that there's minimal time to find flaws. There's some good humor from time to time and the tone is light, although sometimes it catches you off-guard by going serious when you least expect it. The show provides us a realistic, touching friendship between the two protagonists Bisco and Milo. Their occasional banter and emotionally charged friendship moments are one of the major highlights of the story. Both are integral to the plot, although there are times when one easily realizes who's going to steal the show and why the title is Sabikui BISCO. Yet, the story gives good scope to the partners' deep friendship which is stronger beyond words and simple enough to move you. Other characters such as Pawoo, Jabi and even the crab Akutagawa are allowed to shine from time to time.The art itself is simple and straightforward without being too flashy. I know that being based on a light novel, some of the action might not come across as visually striking or extraordinary which normally isn't the case with shows based on manga, but the creators have shown enough innovation and creativity throughout the majority of the show and delivered something one can easily call entertaining, at the end of the day. I personally enjoyed the show and it now has me intrigued to read the light novel. Sabikui Bisco is worth a watch, and while not based on a manga, is pretty much a shounen anime which delivers the excitement and thrills one expects from a show in this demography. crab could have been better, the writing alone is so good that there's minimal time to find flaws.

I\'d recommend reading with caution unless you\'ve finished the anime.For starters, up until a certain point in the story I actually really enjoyed Sabikui Bisco, even now after finishing it, I still think the art and music and sound is very good. The world building is quite...immersive, the art is great, music is good. I didn\'t dislike the characters either although they didn\'t necessairly feel that out of ordinary generic anime personality\'s and the like.I enjoyed it, my previous score for this anime was an 8, but until the last I\'d say the last aswell as the second to last episode or so, basically the final fight things changed. You can say prior to this that I was watching the anime with rose-tinted goggles as the way they handled the climax and ending of this anime made me stop ignoring plotholes and other things I had noticed in previous episodes.I\'ll warn you once again about major spoilers as I will mention a few topics which will spoil some stuff for you, majorly near the end but also some issues that occured and became plotholes earlier on in this show.Where should I even begin, well for starters Kurokawa becoming the big bad enemy for the final mega fight was soooooooo cliché and just felt really cheap. Although I thought it was bad, I can still see a bit of reasoning as to why he was still alive, so even though I feel disappointed about this decision, it\'s not necessairly a plothole in and of itself, although it does leave some things up for debate.Secondly, I\'ll mention the biggest reason my rose-tinted goggles were shattered, the fact that Akaboshi is still alive. You can give any amount of reasoning as to why he might have been still alive, ""well the rust didn\'t kill Kurokawa, so must be the same for Akaboshi, or at least possible"" etc etc. But here\'s the thing, Akaboshi was shot in the HEAD with an arrow. He was literally put down of his misery of dying to rust, by Milo himself. Then he\'s just casually alive inside the big threat of humanity having merged with the Rust Eater or some bullshit? Which in and of itself, is a major plothole as there\'s literally no reasoning given as to why it happened, just ""eh it happened"" not to mention they never adress the fact he DIED due to an arrow entering his SKULL. If they planned on going this route, it would have been much better if he was just consumed by the rust, then you could give your no-reasoning justifications as to why Akaboshi and Kurokawa is still alive by using these imaginary justifications of ""Kurokawa became giant man"" and ""Akaboshi became half mushroom"".Anyway, that part really bugged me out and was a clear immersion breaker for me. It also got me thinking back to all the other plotholes I\'ve witnessed that was never adressed and purely was just a one time thing, boom, we explained that with A but we never explain how A works. I have 2 examples for this.A) First example, Tirol. She\'s clearly the female mercenary bad person of Kurokawa, I think her role later on is fine. However there\'s a clear plothole in this part namely, Akaboshi saw her face when he was in Imahama the first time around, he fought and won over her. We then see her later and it\'s like he has amnesia about her and doesn\'t bring it up at any point in time, so even though we as viewers understand she was never really a bad person, Akaboshi clearly doesn\'t know and should have at the minimum confronted her about it or talked privately with Milo about distrusting her due to.. Her literally working with Kurokawa earlier.B) Rust-Eater and this is a major one as it breaks apart stuff about Mushroom Keepers aswell. The way it works is, it activates due to Mushroom Keeper blood, as we are told. Which would imply Mushroom Keepers are different and unique in a sense, earlier on when Milo gives blood to the Mushroom Keepers of the show, he also has to use blood that works on anything aswell as coming to know that they do not know about blood types and the like. So far, so good but it quickly breaks down after you realize what Mushroom Keepers are in a sense.What defined Jabi and Akaboshi from other characters in the anime? Well they have a bow and arrow, they shoot and mushrooms sprout. That is the main difference. Mushroom Keepers blood being used and being unique, all together would imply this mushroom growth power and all that is powers unique to them. Their blood is unique, they\'re the only ones using a bow and arrow and only ones to grow mushrooms.Which might have been fine, if it wasn\'t for Milo, who doesn\'t have special blood, he\'s not a Mushroom Keeper, he\'s a regular person, but he\'s able to shoot this bow and grow mushrooms the one defining trait of Mushroom Keepers and ultimately it seems he\'s accepted as being one aswell. So the powers of a mushroom keeper is clearly a gimmick that anyone can use, the only defining trait we have left is that their blood is unique. Which more than likely would imply it\'s a certain blood type that others may have aswell and they\'re just unaware, but that breaks down due to all Mushroom Keepers having it, including Kurokawa.Speaking of Mushroom Keepers we never find out who the random evil Mushroom Keeper from the flashbacks were. You can assume it\'s Kurokawa, but it\'s once again something the show never tells you and it\'s more just ""here, reason"" and no explanation.Now that that\'s out the way, all considered, it majorly tanks the story aswell as the characters. The story feels less impactful, you feel like they pulled a fast one on you, it doesn\'t feel coherent and good. The characters were fine until I started thinking about it more and came realization they\'re very generic and mundane.You have cool scary character who\'s actually kind. You have overly kind, wholesome and weak character who becomes strong (not to mention him briefly going insane thinking he\'s Akaboshi which never gets mentioned again and then Akaboshi is just alive magically). You have Pawo/Pawoo who\'s just a physically strong person who has no interesting story, she\'s sick which only serves as a reasoning as to why Milo does what he does and that is it, it never really affects her for the rest of the entire anime and then she randomly falls for Akaboshi, might I add NOT long after she tried to kill him on multiple occasions and thought he kidnapped Milo. Literally within days of her last attack on him, she just kisses him and is in so in love.Just felt cheap, sure if this had been ongoing for a while it could have been justified but we never get that reasoning, it just happens and that\'s the end of it.That\'s probably the end of this review/rant aswell. To wrap things up, it was a decently good anime if you overlook the plotholes, up until the final fight where it all just turned to shit. You can still enjoy it for the most part, it\'s a short anime aswell, but when the plotholes are that obvious that you notice them right from the getgo.. That\'s not good story writing.Not to mention it seems every animal is a literal weapon or a vehicle, but that wasn\'t anything that needed an explanation. Although one would have aided the world building. immersive, the art is great, music is good.

Literally within days of her last attack on him, she just kisses him and is in so in love.Just felt cheap, sure if this had been ongoing for a while it could have been justified but we never get that reasoning, it just happens and that\'s the end of it.That\'s probably the end of this review/rant aswell. To wrap things up, it was a decently good anime if you overlook the plotholes, up until the final fight where it all just turned to shit. You can still enjoy it for the most part, it\'s a short anime aswell, but when the plotholes are that obvious that you notice them right from the getgo.. That\'s not good story writing.Not to mention it seems every animal is a literal weapon or a vehicle, but that wasn\'t anything that needed an explanation.

This anime is an example of an amazing and unique concept, with an actual living world that the characters inhabit, TAINTED by the story and it's characters.It would be easier to point out what the anime did okay, and that is it's world and it's OST. The world that the anime is set in is genuinely unique and captivating, it feels like there's genuine care put in to show and tell a world that is full of the breath of life. The OST further complements the world, and it's genuinely enjoyable. Neither of these are masterpiece material, but ya know, it's...alright.Suspension of disbelief only works for so long, and the viewer can only accept so much before they call BS on the work. The characters go from doing Infinite IQ moves to being dumber than a piece of floating algae in the ocean. The story has ZERO IDEA how to keep the show going without resorting to the characters being absolute potatoes, and alongside the HORRIBLE PACING and the shitty forced one liners and cliche tropes it turns a unbearable cast of characters into a TORTUROUS experience.When the viewer starts questioning everything the characters do, it's when you fail as an anime. They are no longer immersed, they are no longer emotionally attached to the plot, they are simply there to watch the Hindenburg crash to the ground.Don't watch this anime.

As I recently came back to watching anime and rewatched Psycho-Pass right before this one, which provided quite the contrast to this anime, which I will explain below:I'm used to anime with longer and more episodes, and this is definitely something I can see a theme of in this one. It feels like major plot points and events (such as the Panda Doctor leaving the city with Bisco, or the big robot turning out to be controlled by the...bad guy and AT THE SAME TIME having Bisco inside of it) are incredibly undermined, and it only gives the viewer subtle clues as to exactly what is happening or how things are going.I do like myself a little bit of mystery and having to think after a little, but given the extreme over-the-top feel that this anime gives off, maybe it doesn't quite fit. I really loved those elements in Psycho-Pass, where the characters get clues but then make a deduction by themselves in the end and effectively explaining it for the viewers that didn't pick up on it. I feel like this anime is missing that.Other than that, I quite love the opening and ending. The fantasy-ish theme is there, and the animation of it just amazes me. The same cannot be said for the anime though, the animation is lacklustre in some places and often uses 3D models which look like something made in Windows Movie Maker.The characters are go through a lot of development that seems natural and is just barely far-fetched enough to still feel familiar but also distant. In the world they live in, it might as well make sense, but it feels a bit over-the-top a lot of the times. Just like this anime itself!The stakes keep increasing, the risk factor keeps getting higher, and in the end I had to take a break from watching the last 3 episodes because I had just gotten a bit mentally tired, and had to process it.This kind of goes back to what I mentioned earlier, where this anime only has 12 episodes and has to fit a lot more in, compare that to Psycho-Pass with 22 which can obviously fit a lot more story and worldbuilding, as well as pacing it a bit better.The underlying issues of this anime are because of three things:1. The pacing2. The medium-budget animation and 3D models3. The over-the-top (and seemingly rushed) adaptation of the source material writing, which expects the watcher to pay attention to detail and not giving it much attention themselves.Now, thing is, all of these three issues could most likely be solved by giving the anime more episodes and content to build on, more time to think about things, and more budget as well as freedom. It feels like it's true potential isn't reached.Well, it's whatever. The anime is already out now, can't fix that.I honestly would recommend you to watch this anime, but I would also recommend you to rewatch it one or two times to fully understand what's going on.If you're not into that, try to pay attention and keep your eyes on the details, it's going to be worth it in the end.

This doesn't make it bad, but it leaves a lot to be desired. While I haven't read the light novels, at least one important scene (episode 8) that I've heard of would make a lot of people less pissed off. That is to be expected with a new studio and director, but these changes that seem minor can actually be major. Lastly, I think there's too much falling action after the climax, making the story a tragedy would really complete the plot, but maybe that's...just my bias for tragedies lol.Art 8/10The character designs are great; it matches their personalities and are appealing.

Pawoo is definitely one of the best Waifu\'s this year too!

The imagination of the artist is quite amazing, although I have to wonder if he was inspired by using LSD.

It follows the journey of Akaboshi Bisco, a Mushroom Guardian and Milo Nekoyanagi, a doctor interested in the unconventional healing qualities of the supposed dangerous and rust-spreading mushrooms. Together they brave the world in search of the rumored Rust-Eater Mushroom that is said to devour and cure rust while uncovering the secrets of what brought about this deadly plague in the first place.PLOT - 7/10Sabikui Bisco's plot is nothing special. Its strength is in its characters, specifically Bisco and...Milo, and how they bond and eventually take the best qualities from each other and make each other a better person. It has a pretty standard flow of a quest-like journey that leads them on the path of a supposed treasure. My biggest irk with Sabikui Bisco is the main villain and the overall development of the mystery surrounding this strange and bizarre world. Kurokawa is a lackluster villain that does not bring any unique character or motive, even with the slight twist of him being a Mushroom Guardian. Along the same lines, the mystery surrounding the vilification of the Mushroom Guardians and the rust plaguing the world were not engaging or exciting. The plot also seems to enter a general cycle of someone getting caught by the enemy so they need to be rescued type of theme.ART/MUSIC - 9/10The art and music in this show is quite amazing. It boasts decently animated combat scenes, amazing sceneries and character design, and an OST that is perfect for what this show aims to be. The character design is brilliant with great details to each character and the variety of color schemes among them provide a vibrant cast. What stands out the most are the incredible designs of the different wild and wacky creatures within Sabikui Bisco's world from a giant crab to a living mountain war fortress to machine-gun mounted hippos and slug/snail airplanes (???). The creatures featured in this show are executed perfectly and what makes this show truly unique.CHARACTERS - 8/10Sabikui Bisco boasts a very charming main set of characters. Seeing how they bond with each other and develop throughout the series was a major strong point. Headlined by the hot-headed, fiery, and passionate Bisco and the soft, bright, and naive Milo; seeing their journey together and how they shape each other's lives throughout each episode was my favorite part about the series. Not to mention Milo's sister Pawoo and her strong sense of justice that is extremely grounded and leads to her siding and even falling for the red-haired Bisco. Other side characters like Jabi-san and Tirol are equally charming with their respective personalities. Even Actagawa, their crab vehicle/tank has his/her own personality despite not having a single line! My only concern as mentioned earlier is the main villain, Kurokawa. He was just too bland for my taste that it left me wishing for more.ENJOYMENT - 9/10This was another show this season that I was looking forward to every week. Simply because it was such a weird yet refreshing show to watch that was sprinkled with exciting action sequences and heart-warming character development. What truly makes Sabikui Bisco so enjoyable for me is just the vibe and setting of the show. With all the wacky creatures and bizarre premises tied together by a metal-like theme and music, it creates a truly unique show that is extremely enjoyable and easy to watch.OVERALL - 8/10Overall, Sabikui Bisco gets a very, very solid 8. Its charming characters and uniqueness is able to make up for its lack of depth with its plot and villains. It provides a refreshing watch and some great moments that are quite memorable. It is a show that I would LOVE to see more of in the future as it does such an excellent job with its world building and character development that you can't help but wonder what other bizarre creatures and secrets this world has to offer.

Kondo Reina, Tomita Miyu, and Saito Shiro back them up with performances that feel like everyone involved is having so much fun with the script masterfully adapted by Sadayuki Murai.

Though not perfect, there is no good reason not to enjoy this 12 episode series as the bite-sized shounen it is, with all the highs and lows that follow the genre.Sabikui Bisco is an action-adventure comedy featuring a fantastically engaging world and a cast of characters to match, including a friendship straight out of The Epic of Gilgamesh. It\'s a fun,...post-apocalyptic romp with dynamic characters and story. It sucks you in from episode one, as even the most severe critics admit to ""wanting to like it"". My response is that, if you want to like, then like it, as there is so much to love and enjoy. Frankly, it seems to me as if the only critiques come from those who\'ve been so spoiled by masterpieces that they\'ve lost the taste for entertainment which is merely \'great\'.There are flaws, but few worth mentioning. The author\'s creativity and ingenuity often come across as mad genius, but, like its contemporaries such as One Piece and HunterXHunter, sometimes this creativity comes off as merely silly. The shipping feels slightly rushed, but, as a 12 episode series, is to be expected. Most will criticize the ending, and while I feel these complaints can be justified, it comes across as deaf when the author tells you exactly what will happen by foreshadowing, and quite explicitly as well.All-in-all, Sabikui Bisco is a fantastic 12 episodes, and is incredibly enjoyable for what it is. Don\'t take it too seriously, just sit back, laugh, cry, and follow these masterfully written characters as they explore a fascinating post-apocalypse. It\'s a great way to spend time while waiting between seasons to satisfy your shounen appetite while not diving head-first into a 1000 episode saga (not that I won\'t be crossing my fingers for a season 2 or even 3). post-apocalyptic romp with dynamic characters and story.

It is quite colorful despite being a post-apocalypse.The characters are stereotypical. Mostly brash and stupid.None of the characters have common sense nor realism.It's simply a hit or miss.I couldn't bring myself to watch it in a single setting for how boring it can be at times.Overall, I kind of felt disappointed and it felt like a chore...to finish. to finish."", ""Sabikui Bisco is a weird show. The setting is an incredibly wacky post apocalyptic Japan with bizarre animal tech hybrids and mushrooms that can do whatever the plot demands. In a lot of ways this show uses the no rules wackiness of its setting to get away with bad writing and dumb character decisions since it never bothers to explain how anything actually works. There is a massive slump in the middle where every character seems to make the worst decision possible episode after episode as if they had left their brains at home. It was so bad it got me to write my first...review ever on this site that's how annoyed I was. That being said the ending is actually decent.

Where it really went wrong i think is the source material, which was just...

As a viewer as was super interesting what they were going to do with it. And that is the part of the anime that did interesting me a lot.IntroduceAfter watching the first episode I was so interesting in this anime, and I was looking forward to watching the next episode. After watching the last episode I was like that does not make any...sense.Main BodySound & ArtThis is a lot about the anime I like. The Sound (particularly the Music) is a high point of the anime. this takes effect when fighting different monsters. I also like the opening when it comes to sound. I don\'t like the CG in the opening, the main example of this is the crab. (furthermore, the crab CG all throughout the anime really brings down the art and in my view takes away from the world).Story & EnjoymentI am not going to say to much about the story as there is already a Synopsis written by MAl. But I am going to say that my enjoyment of the story is effect by the different main characters and the last few episodes. The story was fine up until the last few episodes which did not make any sense and not in a good way. Furthermore, this anime  has a many good random events but the last few episodes are not one of these events.CharactersFor the characters I am only going to talk about what I thought was the main characters.Bisco Akaboshi- He is the main mushroom keeper in the anime. But he suffers from what a lot of main characters suffer from and that there are just too op. Which doesn\'t make a very good watch. Again the last few episodes make Bisco the worst character in this anime.Milo ""Panda"" Nekoyanagi- He is a doctor that learn to shoot arrows and is smart. that is basically the whole story of this character. yes really boring.Pawoo Nekoyanagi- She is panda sister and knows of to fight. so basically that we have here is one character is a smart and one is a fighter. I have seen this character arc so many times that it is not even funny.Kurokawa- He is a bad guy and he is evil and he does bad things just because he is bad. There is no reason that he is evil he just wants to have power. Again I seen this character so many times. He is so basic that he and the next character is not even given a second name.Jabi- He is the old man character so he is OP until the story does not want him to be.Tirol ""Kurage"" Oochagama- She is the only interesting character in the anime. She does all she can do survive and wants someone saves her she thinks that there after her body. (Not a spoiler because it\'s the scene from the trailer). She is the most interesting character that is written in this anime. which finds the ability to trust again.OverallThe main reason why this anime is fine is because of the interest of the story.

Actually, the story has a broad concept to offer.Yet, the only downfall I felt about this show is how they wasted most of their time on talking instead of fighting the antagonist. It's such a nuisance that they've been hurt because of their negligence.

Rather than focusing on this problem, a cure is created off the...bat and it turns out that Bisco (the mushroom man is actually trying to save people). Mind you this is within the first episode!Characters: 4The anime tries to handle several different characters at once and each characters problem is magically resolved.

Most shows I drop, I drop pretty early, and why bother talking about it further when the process of watching it was a huge waste of my time. But Sabikui Bisco, oh Sabukui Bisco, how dearly the hatred in my heart runs for you. Never before has a show made me so genuinely angry and frustrated, and I don\'t even know if it is truly your fault.Here\'s the thing about tropes, tropes are not inherently bad (real groundbreaking stuff here). The entertainment of the tropes you are using in your creation...relies on how you can best convert those tropes into your own unique style or take. When a trope is done well, it can even subvert your expectations and turn the entire story in an interesting new direction. Now in Sabukui Bisco, two polar opposite dudes, the unassertive, caring, and soft-spoken Milo, and the brash, sarcastic, and insanely strong Bisco, team up and go on a bizarre adventure through strange lands to find the mystical MacGuffin Mushroom which will save the world. I\'m sure you can identify the tropes within that description, and now the question is ""did this show pull off these tropes well?"" The answer to that question is very subjective from what I\'ve seen so far, but to me, it pulled it off well enough by having the duo be mostly entertaining in their interactions with each other and some of the side characters. The dialogue could be witty and funny, and the world in which the characters were traveling in was incredibly interesting, filled with strange mutated animals sometimes converted into weapons or vehicles similar to the old young adult book series ""Leviathan."" Then came Episode 8 and the reintroduction of our main antagonist.Kurokawa is a man almost annoying as he is uninteresting. I think he is like an example for aspiring fiction writers on just how abundantly horrible characters can be when you don\'t subvert or try to change previously established tropes. A man who is practically the incarnation of evil because he just is, working to do evil things because he just can. He checks every god damn box there is, the mustache-twirling monologues, the mocking of the downed hero so his hubris can be his downfall, the comedically over the top performance, the 70 gazillion deus ex machina level aces he has up his sleeves to he can keep getting back the upper hand when he is on the verge of defeat, a verge he is in almost every 5 FUCKING minutes. He literally survives getting shot in the eye with an arrow and then falling 50 feet onto a steel slab without explanation just so he can get into a final confrontation with Bisco and so they can both *tragically* kill each other. Episode 10 is one of the worst pieces of fictional media I have ever watched, a trainwreck from beginning to end, so incredibly frustrating that the death of the main character just fills you with anger rather than sadness because his death has no logical reason for happening besides a dramatic finish with a villain I wish never even existed.Now you might be wondering, why is this sole complaint the reason I dropped this show? This isn\'t just a complaint of one aspect of the show overall, this is a complaint about the final third of this show because I am not kidding around when I say that 3 whole episodes are dedicated to this ridiculous conflict (and hour of your time btw) and 90% of those episodes are just Kurokawa ranting about how he is eviler than satan himself, how he enjoys torturing puppies and children, how he the architect behind every single bad thing to ever happen in this show because why the fuck not? Three whole episodes of this, with occasional breaks for when he nearly dies so he can then pull his UNO reverse card out of his ass and then goes back to his ranting.  It is all I can talk about because it is all I can remember, all the goodwill I felt towards this show just evaporated into thin air when I finished episode 10, and I honestly don\'t care if Bisco comes back through the power of friendship or whatever, his resurrection would be as meaningless as his death.

But for some reason, they just went full Anime by the end. Not only did they pull a ""Dragonball"", but they also slipped some cheesy friendship and romantic moments in a situation that\'s supposed to be the most intense in the series. I don\'t know if they suddenly got lazy? Was it intentional to make people buy and read the Manga instead? Did they change director mid-way? Idk. All I can say...is that they seemed to have cared more for Bisco and Milo\'s BL story than the plot itself by the end.STORY (6/10):While badly executed, the story itself wasn\'t really bad at all. On the contrary, it was unique and quite interesting with its multiple side plots that all revolve around the main plot. If this had 24 episodes there would\'ve been a lot of things to explore: Mushroom Guardians, Tirol\'s backstory, origin of rust, the Iron Titan, Kurokawa\'s backstory for better character motivation, etc. Unfortunately, most of the things I mentioned were squished into the last 5 episodes with minimal explanation. And we can\'t really blame it all on the lack of episodes as they did overspend some of it. Tirol\'s 2 episode build-up was fine in the sense that she did help the protags the 2nd time they saved her. But a bit too much if you consider Pawoo, a somewhat supposed-to-be key player, not even having a proper one, and Kurokawa\'s not being properly laid-out. Speaking of Pawoo, they also spent time on that one filler part where she encountered 2 crazy old people. Nothing was gained from that and that time should\'ve instead been spent exploring the ""Iron Titan"" lore more, which was momentarily discussed during that episode. Milo channeling his inner Bisco was also weird, especially when he was revealed to be alive (I heard there\'s an explanation in the Manga but, that\'s that. This is the Anime). And speaking of Bisco with a gunshot, sinking in boiling rust, and a personally requested death blow with an arrow to the chest coming back to life was too much Anime BS. No explanation can justify all that. Just an excuse to make a surprising episode. Or at least the Anime series didn\'t give enough info to make some sense out of it.I\'d say though. If this will have a 2nd season, it\'s gonna be so much easier to watch and worth giving a 2nd chance as the characters now, at least, are all set, and the world/lore is a bit clearer now.CHARACTERS (6/10):BISCO initially had a mysterious vibe and was seemingly capable of using force to get what he want. Eventually, we find out he\'s just being a very caring son to his rust-infected father-figure, Jabi. During his journey with Milo and Akutagawa, he began showing his soft spots, almost like a child that just had his first friend in Milo, even showed some older brother\'s tough-love teaching method to the children of Tetsujin town, and a surprising innocence when teased by Pawoo. But these things are mostly just to connect with his character. The only thing that mattered in his battle against the Iron Titan was his warrior abilities and his optimistic make-or-break attitude... and the power of Anime and Dragonball.MILO is not too different, being a very kind caring doctor that\'s willing to do dirty/illegal dealings to get the things he needs to cure his sister, Pawoo\'s rust. But unlike Bisco, he\'s not used to fighting, having lived a normal city life. So he\'d spend most of their journey trying to learn as much as he can from Bisco. And credits where credits are due, he did solo that boss (with his Plot Armor) until ""Goku"" arrived to save the world.KUROKAWA, the antagonist, benefitted from a ""less is more"" treatment earlier in the series. He remained mysterious for a while as we only get to see him a few times. But enough to paint him as a menacing individual. Unfortunately, they took all that away and turned him into a generic villain that\'s evil for the sake of money and power.TIROL had more of a heroine vibe than Pawoo with all the character depth they gave her. With her quirkiness, strong personality, an implied harsh backstory, and 2 episodes heavily involving her, you\'d think she\'d be a regular part of the team. But that all summed up to her helping them fix a train. While it makes sense that it took saving her life twice before she decides to help them, it was still too hefty of screentime just for that one thing to be accomplished. She did come back near the end to give Jabi a ride, and to Google ""how to beat boss"" for the protags. Then she pulled a Bulma, hid in safety, and took some loots after the boss battle.PAWOO and JABI are like those OP over-leveled characters you get to play during tutorial but leave the party afterward. Then come back later on when you\'re already stronger than them. Jabi was mostly taken hostage, and Pawoo for the most part was madly chasing Bisco to save Milo thinking he was abducted. Then she felt horny for him, changed her mind, tried to save Jabi but, got hostaged herself.AKUTAGAWA IS BEST BOI! MVP OF THE SERIES!!!ART (7/10) and SOUND (6/10):Art left me wanting when it comes to action scenes. But the character art and design, and the background\'s quality are really something I appreciate a lot.VA\'s are really good. And the OP theme too. I\'m not a fan of the ED, but it was fine. I didn\'t notice any BGM or outstanding sound effects.OVERALL:My main issue with this Anime is that they showed that they can make this a big one early in its run. I still believe it wasn\'t rushed, and that even with just 12 episodes they could\'ve managed to give it a proper final act. But for some reason, they just didn\'t. This is, for me, one of those ""What If"" or ""Could\'ve Been"" Anime that, at best, can only be considered a cult-classic. is that they seemed to have cared more for Bisco and Milo\'s BL story than the plot itself by the end.STORY (6/10):While badly executed, the story itself wasn\'t really bad at all. On the contrary, it was unique and quite interesting with its multiple side plots that all revolve around the main plot. If this had 24 episodes there would\'ve been a lot of things to explore: Mushroom Guardians, Tirol\'s backstory, origin of rust, the Iron Titan, Kurokawa\'s backstory for better character motivation, etc. Unfortunately, most of the things I mentioned were squished into the last 5 episodes with minimal explanation. And we can\'t really blame it all on the lack of episodes as they did overspend some of it. Tirol\'s 2 episode build-up was fine in the sense that she did help the protags the 2nd time they saved her. But a bit too much if you consider Pawoo, a somewhat supposed-to-be key player, not even having a proper one, and Kurokawa\'s not being properly laid-out. Speaking of Pawoo, they also spent time on that one filler part where she encountered 2 crazy old people. Nothing was gained from that and that time should\'ve instead been spent exploring the ""Iron Titan"" lore more, which was momentarily discussed during that episode. Milo channeling his inner Bisco was also weird, especially when he was revealed to be alive (I heard there\'s an explanation in the Manga but, that\'s that. This is the Anime). And speaking of Bisco with a gunshot, sinking in boiling rust, and a personally requested death blow with an arrow to the chest coming back to life was too much Anime BS. No explanation can justify all that. Just an excuse to make a surprising episode. Or at least the Anime series didn\'t give enough info to make some sense out of it.I\'d say though. If this will have a 2nd season, it\'s gonna be so much easier to watch and worth giving a 2nd chance as the characters now, at least, are all set, and the world/lore is a bit clearer now.CHARACTERS (6/10):BISCO initially had a mysterious vibe and was seemingly capable of using force to get what he want. Eventually, we find out he\'s just being a very caring son to his rust-infected father-figure, Jabi. During his journey with Milo and Akutagawa, he began showing his soft spots, almost like a child that just had his first friend in Milo, even showed some older brother\'s tough-love teaching method to the children of Tetsujin town, and a surprising innocence when teased by Pawoo. But these things are mostly just to connect with his character. The only thing that mattered in his battle against the Iron Titan was his warrior abilities and his optimistic make-or-break attitude... and the power of Anime and Dragonball.MILO is not too different, being a very kind caring doctor that\'s willing to do dirty/illegal dealings to get the things he needs to cure his sister, Pawoo\'s rust. But unlike Bisco, he\'s not used to fighting, having lived a normal city life. So he\'d spend most of their journey trying to learn as much as he can from Bisco. And credits where credits are due, he did solo that boss (with his Plot Armor) until ""Goku"" arrived to save the world.KUROKAWA, the antagonist, benefitted from a ""less is more"" treatment earlier in the series. He remained mysterious for a while as we only get to see him a few times. But enough to paint him as a menacing individual. Unfortunately, they took all that away and turned him into a generic villain that\'s evil for the sake of money and power.TIROL had more of a heroine vibe than Pawoo with all the character depth they gave her. With her quirkiness, strong personality, an implied harsh backstory, and 2 episodes heavily involving her, you\'d think she\'d be a regular part of the team. But that all summed up to her helping them fix a train. While it makes sense that it took saving her life twice before she decides to help them, it was still too hefty of screentime just for that one thing to be accomplished. She did come back near the end to give Jabi a ride, and to Google ""how to beat boss"" for the protags. Then she pulled a Bulma, hid in safety, and took some loots after the boss battle.PAWOO and JABI are like those OP over-leveled characters you get to play during tutorial but leave the party afterward. Then come back later on when you\'re already stronger than them. Jabi was mostly taken hostage, and Pawoo for the most part was madly chasing Bisco to save Milo thinking he was abducted. Then she felt horny for him, changed her mind, tried to save Jabi but, got hostaged herself.AKUTAGAWA IS BEST BOI!

I simply loved post-apocalyptic world of which we don\'t have nearly enough lately. Characters are creative and although a bit too idealistic still very believable. Art is great, sound is good and story started very strong.Then motivation of our main characters changed from saving beloved ones to ""lets travel and see the world"" kind of thing but we are totally still getting out beloved ones a cure. Needless to say transition was jarring. After this story goes somewhere else and it feels off. Writers seem to have forgotten everything from the beginning. Story is the biggest letdown...and am really sad for it since if started so good.Should you watch it? I don\'t know, to be honest. Some people seem to like it a lot, others are disappointed like myself.

All the logical leaps to justify the return could have been more believable if the author didn\'t put...a ""plot twist"" just to have a ""plot twist"".Even so, the work is very good.

With two of the biggest juggernauts, this season; Sabikui Bisco made a name for itself with an interesting atypical story, creating space for unorthodox visuals, killer ost, likeable characters and an easily enjoyable show.Sabikui Bisco starts off with a post-apocalyptic world where all science seems to have been redefined. Fish fly, animals are super-sized and flesh-machine hybrids seem commonplace. More importantly, people can rust to death, among other things. Throw in some quest for world domination, some blind public servants and the obligatory rebellious faction and the universe is set for some creative...fight scenes with good storytelling. The art was a nice blend of 3D with traditional animation which didn't take you out of the story but instead, drew you into the strange universe. The OST was amazing with Metal, drum and bass, dubstep, Jazz and everything in between, appropriately uses to build tension, get your heart pumping or chill you out depending on the scene. All the characters are mostly likeable and obey Occam's razor. If you didn't get it before, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It's a refreshing break from all those copy-cat Shonen fight scenes with good storytelling.

We know it\'s stupid, dumb and sometimes even dangerous yet we maniacally embrace the madness and go on with it. Some of us have been probably gave this a watch after seeing the number of talented staff behind the production, some might\'ve watched Anitubers reacting to the trailer but most of us might\'ve watched it after seeing \'that\' one scene in the trailer.

A mushroom protector/criminal with a bow & arrow named ""Bisco"" is searching for an almighty fungus named ""Sabikui (aka Rust Eater)"" to cure his mentor\'s overly grown rust with his gaint crab. With him joins a kind doctor named Milo, who also have a sister/Captain of Imigahama, ""Pawoo"" who also suffers with overly grown rust. Together, Milo & Bisco goes on a crazy journey in order to find the lengdary ""Rust Eater"".Craziness has no limits in this Anime. It introduced all these weird elements to keep the craziness it promised, that it never felt dull or boring while watching the show because of the adrenaline inducing chaos happening on the screen which was greatly enhanced by the absolute bop of the soundtrack. The soundtrack is definitely the strongest point this show, especially in the big moments. It punched through my ears and just ""BLASTED"" my brains off.

No homo, right?""The most disappointing factor for this show is that, while it is crazy it sometimes bends it\'s own logic to bring that madness, which mostly felt very unsatisfying.

A vaguely gay distopian story with hints of Trigun and some Cowboy Bebop esque Episodic storytelling? Sounds like a great time!Where it lost us was in its villain. Its villain is the achilles heel of the entire series. The following will be an exhaustive breakdown of everything wrong with the villain that contains spoilers from episode 8 onwards. Thats really where the troubles began.The villain goes from being the Darth Vader to the Emperor in about two sentences. What I mean by that is- initially he is introduced as feeling similar to just...a high level henchman ala Jaws from James Bond or the Aforementioned Darth Vader. When in Reality he turns out to be the Uber BBEG of the series in the vein of the Emperor or Zuul from Ghostbusters (Idk why I couldnt think of anyone else- dont @ me).Not only is the Villain literally a massive capitalist dickweed by wanting to monopolize the only life-saving medicine available for a world that has been plagued by this disease. BUT he is also the asshole who made everyone hate the protag by spreading rumors about the hero's sacred order AND he also used to be one of them! Realizing now that the emperor comparison is really apt given their backstory... ANYWAY! The villain then completely turns into not a cold, calculating badass who is confident in his every breath, but a complete whiny baby who freaks the fuck out whenever anything even slightly goes haywire in his halfassed plans. Part of this is on the blame of the animators I feel for making him too expressive in these moments, but most of it I think has to do with the writers and the VA for just completely hamming up his performance and dialogue.After episode 8 most of the logic that was present in the series kind of goes out the fuckin window. So much so that the hero and villain (SPOILERS SPOILERY SPOILERDOO) both die in the 9th episode, and both come back to life by the 11th episode. But now they have god powers and immortality and shit.... yeah its just... yeah...The only saving grace is that the ending goes SUPER gay like.... these guys might as well go around summoning rainbows everywhere, but the mushroom allegory kinda gets the same point across so its fine. But im not kidding, the second the villain is defeated, the show goes back to the same show that my girlfriend and I loved beforehand. So- if you're looking to be edged in terms of satisfaction derived from entertainment this is probably a good bet if you feel up to binging it.Overall Id say this show is a fun distraction if you feel up to it. The animation isnt great most of the time but when it slaps it really does. And the ending makes me think a season 2 might not be AS bad. But I reckon that this show will more likely be remembered for its homo-eroticism than anything so if anything it'll probably just provide context for all those horny fanfics you might see on AO3 for the next few months.4/10 needs more gay a high level henchman ala Jaws from James Bond or the Aforementioned Darth Vader.

But everything is thrown away at some point. It feels like every few minutes another writer entered the room, took the script and added something new, partially unrelated to it.The story basically is about how the Japanese inhabitants deal with the fallout of a devastating attack, ushering in an age of stagnation. Meanwhile, Flora and Fauna prosper into new, partly bizarre forms which defy logic and physics. And while I commend the anime for this part of the world building, it...lacks in every other department.First of all, the world building is mostly reduced to its characters, as bigger concepts tend to be touched upon, but hardly ever explored in detail. In one of the earlier episodes the team encounters a walking shrine. Who build it is never explored. The purpose seemed to be clear within the confines of the episode, but thinking about the practicality would be futile. It mostly serves as a visual gag/eye catcher. Ironically this was heavily spoiled by the preview of the previous episode. Furthermore, while many other locales and people returned in the climax, the shrine did not and thus the episode itself felt like a filler, although there were some core character moments. I guess the episode just needed an action highlight at the end. It was, for sure, the weakest episode, not only because it felt like two different episodes, but also the retrospective payback wasn\'t there.The ""Explaining"" part of the anime is generally speaking on the weak side. While the core cast mostly make assumptions about the locales they traverse, the scientific or even in-lore explanations don\'t even start to satisfy the viewer. This comes especially clear in the second-to-last episode, where one of the main characters asks for one of the core concepts of the anime, but didn\'t get an answer. This is highly likely due to the fact, that there may be no answer and that the core of the anime is just a vehicle for action. This, by the way, could be said about almost everything. This applies to the core concepts and to the characters themself.Most notably would be the villain. His core motivation is to maintain the status quo he forces upon the city he governs. But, similar to the story itself, his ambitions change at the midpoint of his journey and he becomes his rage incarnate. And by the way, he doesn\'t get a back story. More like a foot note of ""Oh, by the way, I was one of you all along."" No transition, no reason, he just exists because the story needed a villain. Especially the later incarnation becomes, as mentioned earlier, just a spectacle.And the desire for spectacle is ultimately the thing that drags this anime down. There are many story decisions that undercut previous bits; especially the Deus Ex Machina at the end. No explanation, no follow up. It just happens. It doesn\'t even serve the story much, as the opposite would be far more cathartic. The torch was already given to the next generation but everything is stripped away by this small decision at the end.The art can also feel wonky at some time. Especially in the OP is a small scene where the main character runs towards the camera. This scene in particular feels weak and weirdly out of place in the otherwise stylised opening. Otherwise in most scenes 3D CGI and 2D work together in a good way, so props to that.The sound design also rocks for the most part. Action scenes are well under-layered by good old fashioned metal tracks that amplify the moments.In total Sabukui Bisco is a fine anime with a fine story and fine characters. But it completely fails to address necessary core concepts and undercuts its own premise with shifting goals for the story and its characters. In the end, it is this that makes it hard to pinpoint what this anime is all about. Nature against Humans? Power against Harmony? The visuals make it seem that the story and the characters came full circle in the end, but the lack of explanations makes it more like a dotted line.Edit: After finishing this review I was informed, that there is currently a light novel this anime is based on.

Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50932/Saikyou_Onmyouji_no_Isekai_Tenseiki,"[""The anime version of “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.”Winter 2023 marks the truly historical moment when the anime industry has finally figured out how to make generic isekai that isn’t utter trash. The secret ingredient all along was having a protagonist with some actual personality rather than a basement-dwelling incel. In just one season, we have such isekai protagonists as a professional handyman, a legendary king, or, in the case of this show, an onmyouji from a fantasy version of ancient Japan.Now, there is a meme that Mark Twain’s “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court” is the first-ever isekai novel. It’s nothing...but a meme, yet that novel and this anime have fundamentally the same premise. Take a cliched fantasy setting, add a protagonist that normally belongs in a completely different kind of story, watch how he fucks shit up with his out-of-place skillset, toolset, and above all else, mindset. Seeing a 19th-century engineer wrecking medieval knights with dynamite and electricity is the same kind of fun as seeing an oriental occultist wrecking medieval-Europe-inspired-JRPG with curses, ayakashi, paper talismans, and machiavellian scheming.Just this single change of protagonist is enough to shake up the entire dynamic of the genre. Even if all the other elements of the story remain cliched, a unique main character completely recontextualizes them. For example, the protagonist regrets his previous life and wants to have a redo. Except he wasn’t an otaku shut-in that regrets masturbating to anime figurines, he was a mastermind occultist that threw his weight around too much, made too many enemies, and ended up betrayed and murdered in a political conspiracy. His version of “redo” isn’t to have sex, it’s to take the chill pill and follow his occult pursuit without getting involved with the fates of the world. Likewise, the supporting cast is just girls that make up the MC’s harem. Except he doesn’t treat them as a harem, he treats them as acolytes, that is, half retainers, half pupils, half daughters. I’ve seen so many unthinking complaints about the protagonist being dense in regard to one girl’s crush on him. No, he isn’t dense, he is 20-30 years older than her and treats her like an adopted daughter, and, I know this might be shocking for isekai-watching weebs, but when a normal 40-year-old man hears his 15-year-old daughter describe what kind of a man she wants to marry, his first thought isn’t supposed to be, “wow, she wants to marry ME.” Such recontextualizations are more than enough to make the story feel fresh.What really brings it all together, however, is quality writing. Other isekai shows I’ve mentioned earlier still aren’t worth watching despite interesting protagonists because their writing simply isn’t good enough. This show makes its story work by putting intelligent thought into it. The very premise of the protagonist having to TRY to be chill already implies that it’s not an attitude that comes to him naturally, deep down he believes that with great power comes great responsibility, so he can’t walk five steps without trying to bring the dead back to life or thwart demonic conspiracies - attracting unwanted attention (everyone with half a brain suspects him to be some kind of a demon) and having companions calling him out on straying from the original goal. The harem members also have actual lives, goals, and motivations not limited to wanting to be MC’s property (ironic, considering one of them is a literal slave).The slave girl’s storyline is particularly high-brow, the protagonist pretty much spells out, “you’re not obligated to suck my dick just because I treat you with basic human decency, your life could have plenty of possibilities if you were allowed to actually go and live it” (a polar opposite of the usual isekai incel mentality regarding the whole slave girl trope); and furthermore, the arc’s antagonist is a very nuanced take on the douchebag prince archetype (Joffrey Baratheon) in that he isn’t so much evil, as terminally self-entitled to a point where he genuinely believes he’s the good guy for “rescuing” (kidnapping) the slave girl. Interesting antagonists is one of the strongest points of the series in general.The only notable flaw of the story is being backloaded - the introductory episodes are not nearly as interesting as the second half of the show.9/10 for a formulaic isekai that is actually watchable. but a meme, yet that novel and this anime have fundamentally the same premise. Take a cliched fantasy setting, add a protagonist that normally belongs in a completely different kind of story, watch how he fucks shit up with his out-of-place skillset, toolset, and above all else, mindset. Seeing a 19th-century engineer wrecking medieval knights with dynamite and electricity is the same kind of fun as seeing an oriental occultist wrecking medieval-Europe-inspired-JRPG with curses, ayakashi, paper talismans, and machiavellian scheming.Just this single change of protagonist is enough to shake up the entire dynamic of the genre. Even if all the other elements of the story remain cliched, a unique main character completely recontextualizes them. For example, the protagonist regrets his previous life and wants to have a redo. Except he wasn’t an otaku shut-in that regrets masturbating to anime figurines, he was a mastermind occultist that threw his weight around too much, made too many enemies, and ended up betrayed and murdered in a political conspiracy. His version of “redo” isn’t to have sex, it’s to take the chill pill and follow his occult pursuit without getting involved with the fates of the world. Likewise, the supporting cast is just girls that make up the MC’s harem. Except he doesn’t treat them as a harem, he treats them as acolytes, that is, half retainers, half pupils, half daughters. I’ve seen so many unthinking complaints about the protagonist being dense in regard to one girl’s crush on him. No, he isn’t dense, he is 20-30 years older than her and treats her like an adopted daughter, and, I know this might be shocking for isekai-watching weebs, but when a normal 40-year-old man hears his 15-year-old daughter describe what kind of a man she wants to marry, his first thought isn’t supposed to be, “wow, she wants to marry ME.” Such recontextualizations are more than enough to make the story feel fresh.What really brings it all together, however, is quality writing.

Some may call it a generic trashy power fantasy, but I thought it was great and loved the MC’s personality. The fact he’s a grown man reincarnated into a fantasy world while still retaining the full memories, maturity and even abilities from his past life was enough of a unique twist to make it a fun watch.My biggest issue with most isekai is that the MC is reincarnated and is an idiot. Not the case here. Seika is fully aware of all of his previous experiences and is doing his best to avoid the...fate he suffered in his past life, being betrayed because of his power. Instead, he opts to seek out other strong people and support them rather than being the focal point of this story. I like sly and conniving MCs who put themselves first rather than some bs morals. Seika will do anything to prevent going down the same path again. Including lying, manipulating and even killing people. That ruthlessness is very much refreshing to me as I hate goody goody two shoes paradigm of morality style MCs. I thought it was really cool how he befriended several characters in the story with the idea of getting them strong enough to deal with the threats in the world, rather than him. Seeing the mind games he played every episode was great.Of course, even though you’ve got a somewhat unique MC, you still do have your usual isekai tropes, childhood friend/servant who’s in love with MC purely because he’s nice to her, magical school setting, jealous brother, rapey characters who are rapey purely to get you to dislike them, etc. At this point it is what it is, you know what you’re gonna get with an isekai setting and although things like this can get repetitive, I liked the world and mechanics enough to still have a lot of fun. I think the last 3 episodes was where stuff really started going down. The princess that was introduced was really the first person in the series who could compete with Seika mentally. Everyone else is pretty dumb in the story, so getting someone who isn’t an idiot was nice. I wish we would have got more of that. But these are overall minor complaints for me. I just like the show. It’s kind of basic, but feels different enough to hit all the right spots. Plus, I just love isekai. Sue me.Animation is pretty mediocre here. Luckily, there’s not a lot of it to speak of. Most of the fights are just seika using his summoning abilities so it didn’t stand out too much. Art style is your usual fantasy style, nothing to write home about, but not bad. Pacing is pretty good, I haven’t had a chance to read the LN yet, but from an anime perspective nothing feels rushed or anything. I think if anything the tournament arc felt a little slow.Saikyou Onmyouji was great for me.

Nothing besides showing everyone he meets how strong...and unbeatable he is. Like wtf? What\'s the point? Well, there\'s none.

He doesn\'t really have a personality. just that ""goal"" of cunning and gathering hot girls under him to further his goal (like world\'s greatest assassin). ofcourse, being a power fantasy, he doesn\'t need a personality. all he needs to say is ""everything went according to plan"" at the end of a fight and win.rest of the characters:there\'s a slave (maid) under MC, who is in love with MC bcoz he is a great master i guess?. there\'s another red haired girl similar to like eris from mushoku tensei, who might be a tsundere and wants to be strong . a family of MC with two brothers (one likes him. other is kinda like bakugo from boku no hero academia, jealous of MC). most are just NPCs who react to whatever our great MC does and be amazed.Art and Music are nice.

I think a lot of folks write it off early because it's isekai and with a harem theme (two of my favs to be fair), but that aside- it is extremely well executed and is unique enough to be its own.The short premise of the show is that Haryushi Kuga is the most powerful and OP mofo ever, and he is reincarnated into this world as Seika. Luckily, nearly all his abilities/magic carry through to this world too, so yeah he is an absolute badass. But he's...also trying to not meet the same fate as his old life- so he tries to enjoy the mundane life as much as possible without showing off his powers. He does this by manipulating people and events so he doesn't stand out. Some of it is pretty clever. However, Seika being Seika- and that he's simply too kind of a person, as the story progresses it gets tougher and tougher to really hide who he is.Speaking of the plot, it is amazing. First of all, the show does an great job at pacing. The plot unveils itself and the more you learn, the more you want to know. Seika and his friends are....special, but that's to say the last. There is a twist in the show that I absolutely love and why it got ranked so high. I love these types of unexpected events, so yeah- the plot is really good.The star and reason the show is so good is of course Seika. He's not your generic average run of the mill isekai MC. No. This dude is his own man. He is experienced and cunning. He is powerful. Yet he is kind and generous. He wants to protect the people he cares about. The show does a great job showing Seika's inner conflict of what he should- if he should reveal his true powers to the world or not. Oh and by the way- when Seika throws it, it is absolutely badass. This dude's magical abilities are god-like, I kid you not. I really enjoy him going ham on those deserving of it. How about the rest of the cast? They're okay. Most are forgetable, but at least they develop two of his harem girls- Yifa and Amyu. I actually really like them, especially Yifa. You get to see her resolves grow.It really is a shame this anime never got a second season. I really want to know what happens next. The story is THAT good.So do I recomment his anime? Hell yeah. Watch it. Love it. Thank me later. also trying to not meet the same fate as his old life- so he tries to enjoy the mundane life as much as possible without showing off his powers. He does this by manipulating people and events so he doesn't stand out. Some of it is pretty clever. However, Seika being Seika- and that he's simply too kind of a person, as the story progresses it gets tougher and tougher to really hide who he is.Speaking of the plot, it is amazing. First of all, the show does an great job at pacing. The plot unveils itself and the more you learn, the more you want to know. Seika and his friends are....special, but that's to say the last. There is a twist in the show that I absolutely love and why it got ranked so high.

By now we already know how generic isekai has become but this one takes the cake.

In reality he comes off as exceptionally predictable and stupid character but we are suppose to not notice that somehow.Am dropping this simply because am fed up.

I have never written a review on any of the animes I've watched. But, I have to write about this thing because I do not want anyone to see this idiotic piece of trash. The beginning was well and good. But as the story progressed, it became more and more senseless. I am here after watching the 8th episode. It was the worst ever episode of any anime I have watched till now. The MC is idiotic and has no basic sense at all. It feels like watching a toddler trying to solve algebra problems. He is a reincarnate but still has no...IQ at all. Another major problem is story is boring and has no progress at all. A whole season is just wasted trying to do nonsensical work. On the outside, it may look like OP MC is enough for us to watch this anime, but on the inside, even OP MC could not save this anime from being given a horrible rating.

Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki, copies story and character arcs from a dozen different highly rated anime, and surprisingly, manages to sew them all together into a solid, coherent show that stands on its own two feet.Despite bringing next to nothing new or unique to the table, there's a lot to love about an anime that reminds you of the best parts of good shows from the past.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 8/10-----------------------------------------------The show looks pretty nice. The animations are nothing to write home about, but the art is nice and clean, setting and backgrounds are...solid, and magical effects can even be called straight up good.Combat coordination in regards to physical combat is lackluster, but magical effects make up for it and in general are enjoyable to watch play out.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10------------------------------------------Fairly standard anime stuff. I did quite enjoy the emotional ending tracks.Story - 8/10-------------If you're looking for a unique story, you've come to the wrong place. However, don't let that get you down.This anime features a story that's surprisingly good as a whole even if not unique, because it manages to grab all the important bits of other successful shows and mixes them together into something that ticks all the right boxes when it comes to Fantasy Isekai enjoyment.The premise of the show might be the slightly more uncommon one among this genre, namely the Isekai aspect. Our protagonist chooses to re-incarnate himself, but ends up landing in a different world. The best parallel would be with the show Misfit of the Demon Academy, except in that show the MC landed in the same world.That tiny curveball aside, the story features our MC growing up in the cliche noble household, learning to embrace his powers once more and adapt them to the new world, we get a low-key romance story with a childhood friend, we get sibling rivalry, we get a School arc, a School Tournament arc, we get an overarching story underneath that promises grand adventures and yeah... it's nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. But I think it's all pretty well done, they understand the audience and gave us exactly what we wanted.The ending of the show also throws a few interesting curveballs and makes a solid landing. You won't be blue-balled with a cliffhanger, but there's plenty of room for sequels.Characters - 8/10---------------------The cast isn't large, but I find them all likeable. The MC is overpowered, confident, competent, intelligent. He knows what he wants and how to get it. Few things surprise him. It's always good to see MC's that aren't fumbling through their entire existence. And despite being overpowered, he isn't omnipotent and has to rely on all his skills to get what he wants.The show features a small harem of secondary characters, but they're decently developed. They all have their background arcs, we learn about their personalities, a bit of their history, we see them act properly in character, and despite the obvious romance undertones, the show never pushes its welcome and keeps it reasonable. No girl is falling straight up heads over heels for the MC, which is nice to see. Despite how competent he is, I'm tired of every woman wetting their panties the moment they see a decent male. The girls are also very competent themselves which I also favour highly. Too many damsels in distress is boring.---Total - 8/10---Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki may very well be the very definition of cliche when it comes to Fantasy Isekai, but I think there's a lot of enjoyment to be had from it. Not every show needs to try to re-invent the wheel and risk failing miserably.

Dressing is a big deal to me -- ever since I (a) became single, and (b) lost 60 pounds, I\'ve become something of a clotheshorse. I don\'t know the etymology of that expression, but it\'s such a neat word I wanted to use it. (Am I like a sawhorse, but for clothing instead of sawing?)At any rate, I\'ve started shopping at the smallest, snottiest, exclusiviest (I know, not a...word) little men\'s boutiques I can find. At first I was content merely having the guys at Nordstrom all know me by name (and call me when they got a new season\'s worth of fashions), but that was merely a gateway (like marijuana in the eyes of conservatives) to littler shops, where each individual thread in a garment has a value measured in dollars, not pennies.Sadly, these kinds of shirts require dry-cleaning, which requires that I make it to the dry-cleaner. This is something of an issue for me, because I\'m wont to keep odd hours, and because when I\'m awake I\'m usually working (c.f. ""being single, the suckiness inherent therein""). So, for the last week, in preparation for WWDC, I\'ve been driving around with a big blue laundry bag full of dirty shirts in the passenger seat of my pimp ride.I should mention that, when I was a wee lad, I had visions of one day getting a pimp ride, so that when I passed pretty women on the side of the street who were forlornly walking somewhere, I could pull up and say, ""Hey, mamasita, you want a ride?"" I\'ve since been informed that women find this, in fact, really creepy, so I\'ve never actually done it, but I have to mention that every guy has a fantasy of one day doing this, even while admitting this fantasy is in direct opposition to any possible reality.[I should also mention that should I wish to Jackson out and hit on 12-year-old boys, instead of women, a pimp ride is the perfect way to go. The number of times I\'ve had 12-year-old boys yell out ""pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp!"" to me when I drive by is surprisingly high, considering I had previously never heard the ""pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp"" call and have no idea what it means. But for 12-year-olds it\'s some kind of lingua franca.]At any rate, you can imagine how cool it is to drive by a pretty woman walking in the rain and think, ""Hey, I should offer her a ride... wait, then she\'d have to have my big bag of stinky shirts in her lap... that\'d probably strike her as pretty strange... possibly even frightening.""--So it is that, when packing for WWDC 2005, I only took one good shirt with me. Mind you, this was a really good shirt. This shirt was made in London by a guy named Ted or James or some such, which to me lends instant credibility to it, because as much as I love (the blue states in) my country, when I think of America I think of rebels, I think of individualists, I think of can-do spirit and an indomitable dedication to individual freedoms and happiness. But I don\'t think, ""nice shirts!""London, on the other hand, has class and panache, and Ted/James clearly was the latest in a long line of shirt-makers who had, for generations, been making shirts for discerning gentlemen, not carrying guns, and/or shipping off criminals to unsettled countries.Nor is the cotton in this shirt simply from normal cotton plants, oh no. It\'s grown someplace exotic, like Morocco, and it seems to carry a slight scent of the spices of distant lands on it. Bury your face in this shirt and you can almost hear Bogey whispering, ""Listen, kid, this shirt is bigger than the both of us...""I\'ve received about five or so unsolicited compliments in this shirt, which is five more than I have in any other shirt. Guys don\'t get complimented on shirts a lot, unless they say, ""Hey, look at this shirt,"" which I admit I\'ve done a couple times, but I\'m saying I\'ve been complimented on this shirt without fishing for it, five times.--And so I wore this shirt on Tuesday at WWDC 2005, because Tuesday was the day of the Apple Design Awards. My previous company had won a number of these when I was running it, and so this award had a personal meaning to me. This was the first time my new company had entered, and I had high hopes. And, should I win, I wanted to be up on that stage smiling at the crowd while looking fine in my shirt that combined the best parts of London and Morocco.And here\'s where the story take a tragic turn, because, in their unknowable yet infallible wisdom, Apple suddenly decided the Design Awards would be on Wednesday. I found this out late Tuesday, and spent the day grousing to all and sundry about how this messed up my plans vis-a-vis the shirt. And everyone agreed that it was, in fact, a very nice shirt, but I should note that I didn\'t count these compliments towards my previously-mentioned total of five, because I was really fishing.For a moment I thought this mishap might end up for the best, because that night several of us nerds ended up at a bar, and in my mildly drunken state I started talking with a pretty lady about... well, I don\'t remember. Something, I\'m sure. We\'ll call her Laurie Anderson, because she looks just like a young Laurie Anderson, and it\'ll be more evocative this way. I didn\'t exactly hit on Laurie, per se, but I will say I was glad I was wearing a nice shirt. It wasn\'t until the next night that one of her friends let me know, in a very friendly manner, that if I had intentions towards Ms. Anderson I might reconsider them, because she was, in fact, as interested in women as I was.Which was a nice thing to do, frankly, because it\'s good to know the boundaries of your relationship with someone right at the start -- I like it when women I\'m talking to let it be known they have a steady boyfriend, for example, not because I can then cut bait and run, but because I can adjust my expectations and demeanor accordingly, and not embarrass myself or her. For example, you don\'t say, ""I want to nibble your neck,"" to a woman with a boyfriend. Instead, you\'d use the more coy, ""If you didn\'t have a boyfriend, I would certainly be interested in your neck, vis-a-vis the nibbling thereof."" See, it\'s all about delivery.But, upon reflection later that night, I felt I hadn\'t made very effective use of my shirt, and so it was with a heavy heart that I finally took it off, realizing that it had been sullied for naught. Actually, I was pretty drunk when I got back to the hotel, so all I remember is thinking how much effort it was to take clothes off and put them in a pile.--It was the next afternoon (morning having been lost to C2H5OH), while I was putting on one of my t-shirts and again mentioning how unhappy I was to be thus dressed for the Design Awards, that Mike said, with that clarity of vision associated with the genius, ""Hey, you could, like, go buy a new shirt.""T2 and I looked at each other, and although it may have been that we were both still under the affects of chemicals, we instantly agreed this was why Mike was The Smart One. My day had a purpose now, and my step had a spring to it.I asked the concierge where I might find a fancy, fashion-forward shirt in downtown San Francisco. I figured this would be a slam-dunk. Here\'s a city whose culture ranks up there with New York and Paris. Here\'s a city where the rich scions of industry have nothing to do with their money but impress each other with their fancy baubles and ornaments.She pulled out a map and circled a block. ""Here\'s a Nordstrom\'s!"" Wrong, wrong, wrong. First off, Nordstrom\'s is NOT fashion-forward, even if they do try to sell orange shirts to golfers in the winter. Second, if I wanted to go to freaking Nordstrom\'s, I\'d GO TO THE ORIGINAL ONE, RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I LIVE. I\'m in San Francisco. The city by the bay! Wow me with your culture!""There\'s a Saks on 3rd?"" NO! No no no no no! You are not getting me. I want a boutique. ""Well, Nordstrom\'s has different departments, they\'re kind of like boutiques..."" No! How\'d we get back here? Seriously, no!Then, suddenly, she saw. ""Oh, there\'s a little place called Pink, you might check that out, if you\'re not freaked out by the name."" Lady, I\'m a true metrosexual. I\'m not worried about my masculinity when I shop. You could tell me the store is called ""Sweaty Men in a Bathhouse"" and I\'d go there if it had Moroccan cotton.T2 and I jumped into a cab and I immediately bought two ""slim-fit"" shirts from Thomas Pink, of London. The gentlemen who helped us were classy and helpful without the slightest trace of condescension, which was nice considering I came in wearing a WWDC polo shirt and T2 had what appeared to be an original 1970s ""Dark Side of the Moon"" T-shirt on.--This year was the 10th anniversary of the Apple Design awards, and as such they decided to celebrate by gussing the whole event up, in an homage/parody of the Academy Awards. This struck me as entirely apropos, as I estimate to the 1,000 of us nerds who were there, this was our Academy Awards. This was our Nobel prize. This was our moment.At the start of the evening one of the high mucky-mucks of Developer Relations, who happens to be a very pretty lady, floated onstage in a drop-dead gorgeous gown. We\'ll call her Natasha Richardson because she looks like a Natasha\'s younger sister might. (Yes, I know Natasha already has a younger sister.)There\'s another fact you should know at this point, which is that nerds are not, inherently, asexual. We don\'t have much success with women, but that doesn\'t mean we are immune to their charms. Quite the opposite. We fall under such a spell that we are unable to function, and this renders us so unattractive that it creates a self-perpetuating cycle of desperate singlehood.So, in that first moment, 1,000 nerds fell in love with Natasha. Well, 996 nerd guys fell in love with her, and the four women in the crowd thought, ""Wow, I wonder where she got that dress?"" (Laurie Anderson was out partying elsewhere, but I think it\'s safe to assume she would have been crushing, too, had she been present.)As she started to speak a strange calm came over the crowd, as if we were cavemen seeing fire for the first time, or rats hearing a certain piper. There was also some guy in a tux on stage with her, I think. I don\'t know if anyone remembers. Maybe he was tall?Immediately my mind was no longer on whether I won the award, but on what I would say to her if I did. When the first award was given, the guy who won it kept whispering things to her as his product was described to the crowd, and I noticed that her lapel mic was sensitive enough that we could all hear what he was saying. This dashed somewhat my plans to hit on her on-stage, because everyone in the crowd would be able to hear me saying, ""So, uh, want to ride in my car sometime, uh, assuming I move the laundry? I\'ve been led to understand that it\'s, uh, pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp.""--When Natasha called out the name of our company for Best User Experience the four of us ran onstage, and I shook her hand as she handed me the cool glowing cube, hand-designed by Jonathan Ives. I think she said, ""Congratulations,"" and if I recall I replied, coyly, ""Thanks."" Playing it smooth... way to go Wil. Don\'t tip your hand yet, old boy. Best to slip in under RADAR. Way under RADAR.Afterwards, the winners all had to come up front to sign a ton of forms in exchange for our phat loot. Natasha was there amongst us, and I recognized that, if ever I would had a chance, this was it. Time to shine!I strode up to her confidently. Ok, well, I didn\'t stride, really, because I pinched a nerve in my neck last month, and ever since I\'ve had to walk kind of hunched over, with my head forward, as if I were a cro-magnan man, or possibly just suffered from osteoporosis. Check it out, ladies! I\'m unevolved and/or very old!The problem is, if I stand up straight, the nerve gets pinched and I lose all feeling in my left arm, and the ability to move it. On the other hand, I knew being hunched over was unattractive, so I kept sort of bending my lower torso backwards to compensate for my bent-forward neck, the end effect being that I bobbed along like a pigeon when I walked.So I coo-cooed up to her and gave her my most winning wince (because I had tweaked the nerve in the bobbing motion). While I admit this isn\'t a word-for-word transcript, this is, I feel, an accurate depiction of what went down:Natasha: ""Congratulations on your win!""Me: ""Nice dress! So pretty! Where dress come from?""Natasha: ""Oh, an assistant and I just ran out to Saks today to get it.""

Us make pretty girl happy!""--The next night we celebrated our win in style, inviting everyone we met from the conference to get free drinks on us at Captain Eddie Rickenbacker\'s bar, within stumbling distance of Moscone center. Laurie and her entourage came with us, as well as various other new best friends I\'d met at the conference. One guy we\'d met while out carousing looked and acted almost exactly like Brad Pitt (circa Ocean\'s 11), so we actually called him Brad to make our lives easy. In fact, a lot of us got celebrity names; our crazy Australian friend was dubbed ""Robert Downey, Jr,"" and it was a title that fit both his looks and his personality perfectly -- I don\'t think I ever saw him sober during the conference. (I was later dubbed ""George Clooney,"" but I think at this point they were stretching the conceit.)Robert Downey and I had seen a couple of very pretty, very young German ""au pairs"" on our way to the bar, and had convinced them to come along because, well, partying with forty guys and one lesbian is only so much fun. I talked to them for a while at the bar, but it soon became clear they were much too young for me, so I grabbed an extra chair and called Brad Pitt over, and they quickly turned their full attention to him. My work done, I wandered outside with a couple drinks, and sat with Laurie while she smoked her ""American Spirit""s.Laurie thought I might be down after getting passed over by the 20-year-olds. ""You know, you\'re much cuter than Brad Pitt,"" she said, lying in that sweet motherly way that makes you feel good not because you believe it, but because you appreciate the sentiment behind the lie. ""Look at you: you\'re smart, successful, handsome, and very intriguing."" Her friend nodded agreement.And, seriously, whatever liberties I\'m taking with the truth elsewhere in this tale, I\'m not making this part up:""Also, you have totally great taste in shirts."" word) little men\'s boutiques I can find. At first I was content merely having the guys at Nordstrom all know me by name (and call me when they got a new season\'s worth of fashions), but that was merely a gateway (like marijuana in the eyes of conservatives) to littler shops, where each individual thread in a garment has a value measured in dollars, not pennies.Sadly, these kinds of shirts require dry-cleaning, which requires that I make it to the dry-cleaner. This is something of an issue for me, because I\'m wont to keep odd hours, and because when I\'m awake I\'m usually working (c.f. ""being single, the suckiness inherent therein""). So, for the last week, in preparation for WWDC, I\'ve been driving around with a big blue laundry bag full of dirty shirts in the passenger seat of my pimp ride.I should mention that, when I was a wee lad, I had visions of one day getting a pimp ride, so that when I passed pretty women on the side of the street who were forlornly walking somewhere, I could pull up and say, ""Hey, mamasita, you want a ride?"" I\'ve since been informed that women find this, in fact, really creepy, so I\'ve never actually done it, but I have to mention that every guy has a fantasy of one day doing this, even while admitting this fantasy is in direct opposition to any possible reality.[I should also mention that should I wish to Jackson out and hit on 12-year-old boys, instead of women, a pimp ride is the perfect way to go. The number of times I\'ve had 12-year-old boys yell out ""pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp!"" to me when I drive by is surprisingly high, considering I had previously never heard the ""pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp"" call and have no idea what it means. But for 12-year-olds it\'s some kind of lingua franca.]At any rate, you can imagine how cool it is to drive by a pretty woman walking in the rain and think, ""Hey, I should offer her a ride... wait, then she\'d have to have my big bag of stinky shirts in her lap... that\'d probably strike her as pretty strange... possibly even frightening.""--So it is that, when packing for WWDC 2005, I only took one good shirt with me. Mind you, this was a really good shirt. This shirt was made in London by a guy named Ted or James or some such, which to me lends instant credibility to it, because as much as I love (the blue states in) my country, when I think of America I think of rebels, I think of individualists, I think of can-do spirit and an indomitable dedication to individual freedoms and happiness. But I don\'t think, ""nice shirts!""London, on the other hand, has class and panache, and Ted/James clearly was the latest in a long line of shirt-makers who had, for generations, been making shirts for discerning gentlemen, not carrying guns, and/or shipping off criminals to unsettled countries.Nor is the cotton in this shirt simply from normal cotton plants, oh no. It\'s grown someplace exotic, like Morocco, and it seems to carry a slight scent of the spices of distant lands on it. Bury your face in this shirt and you can almost hear Bogey whispering, ""Listen, kid, this shirt is bigger than the both of us...""I\'ve received about five or so unsolicited compliments in this shirt, which is five more than I have in any other shirt. Guys don\'t get complimented on shirts a lot, unless they say, ""Hey, look at this shirt,"" which I admit I\'ve done a couple times, but I\'m saying I\'ve been complimented on this shirt without fishing for it, five times.--And so I wore this shirt on Tuesday at WWDC 2005, because Tuesday was the day of the Apple Design Awards. My previous company had won a number of these when I was running it, and so this award had a personal meaning to me. This was the first time my new company had entered, and I had high hopes. And, should I win, I wanted to be up on that stage smiling at the crowd while looking fine in my shirt that combined the best parts of London and Morocco.And here\'s where the story take a tragic turn, because, in their unknowable yet infallible wisdom, Apple suddenly decided the Design Awards would be on Wednesday. I found this out late Tuesday, and spent the day grousing to all and sundry about how this messed up my plans vis-a-vis the shirt. And everyone agreed that it was, in fact, a very nice shirt, but I should note that I didn\'t count these compliments towards my previously-mentioned total of five, because I was really fishing.For a moment I thought this mishap might end up for the best, because that night several of us nerds ended up at a bar, and in my mildly drunken state I started talking with a pretty lady about... well, I don\'t remember. Something, I\'m sure. We\'ll call her Laurie Anderson, because she looks just like a young Laurie Anderson, and it\'ll be more evocative this way. I didn\'t exactly hit on Laurie, per se, but I will say I was glad I was wearing a nice shirt. It wasn\'t until the next night that one of her friends let me know, in a very friendly manner, that if I had intentions towards Ms. Anderson I might reconsider them, because she was, in fact, as interested in women as I was.Which was a nice thing to do, frankly, because it\'s good to know the boundaries of your relationship with someone right at the start -- I like it when women I\'m talking to let it be known they have a steady boyfriend, for example, not because I can then cut bait and run, but because I can adjust my expectations and demeanor accordingly, and not embarrass myself or her. For example, you don\'t say, ""I want to nibble your neck,"" to a woman with a boyfriend. Instead, you\'d use the more coy, ""If you didn\'t have a boyfriend, I would certainly be interested in your neck, vis-a-vis the nibbling thereof."" See, it\'s all about delivery.But, upon reflection later that night, I felt I hadn\'t made very effective use of my shirt, and so it was with a heavy heart that I finally took it off, realizing that it had been sullied for naught. Actually, I was pretty drunk when I got back to the hotel, so all I remember is thinking how much effort it was to take clothes off and put them in a pile.--It was the next afternoon (morning having been lost to C2H5OH), while I was putting on one of my t-shirts and again mentioning how unhappy I was to be thus dressed for the Design Awards, that Mike said, with that clarity of vision associated with the genius, ""Hey, you could, like, go buy a new shirt.""T2 and I looked at each other, and although it may have been that we were both still under the affects of chemicals, we instantly agreed this was why Mike was The Smart One. My day had a purpose now, and my step had a spring to it.I asked the concierge where I might find a fancy, fashion-forward shirt in downtown San Francisco. I figured this would be a slam-dunk. Here\'s a city whose culture ranks up there with New York and Paris. Here\'s a city where the rich scions of industry have nothing to do with their money but impress each other with their fancy baubles and ornaments.She pulled out a map and circled a block. ""Here\'s a Nordstrom\'s!"" Wrong, wrong, wrong. First off, Nordstrom\'s is NOT fashion-forward, even if they do try to sell orange shirts to golfers in the winter. Second, if I wanted to go to freaking Nordstrom\'s, I\'d GO TO THE ORIGINAL ONE, RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I LIVE. I\'m in San Francisco. The city by the bay! Wow me with your culture!""There\'s a Saks on 3rd?"" NO! No no no no no! You are not getting me. I want a boutique. ""Well, Nordstrom\'s has different departments, they\'re kind of like boutiques..."" No! How\'d we get back here? Seriously, no!Then, suddenly, she saw. ""Oh, there\'s a little place called Pink, you might check that out, if you\'re not freaked out by the name."" Lady, I\'m a true metrosexual. I\'m not worried about my masculinity when I shop. You could tell me the store is called ""Sweaty Men in a Bathhouse"" and I\'d go there if it had Moroccan cotton.T2 and I jumped into a cab and I immediately bought two ""slim-fit"" shirts from Thomas Pink, of London. The gentlemen who helped us were classy and helpful without the slightest trace of condescension, which was nice considering I came in wearing a WWDC polo shirt and T2 had what appeared to be an original 1970s ""Dark Side of the Moon"" T-shirt on.--This year was the 10th anniversary of the Apple Design awards, and as such they decided to celebrate by gussing the whole event up, in an homage/parody of the Academy Awards. This struck me as entirely apropos, as I estimate to the 1,000 of us nerds who were there, this was our Academy Awards. This was our Nobel prize. This was our moment.At the start of the evening one of the high mucky-mucks of Developer Relations, who happens to be a very pretty lady, floated onstage in a drop-dead gorgeous gown. We\'ll call her Natasha Richardson because she looks like a Natasha\'s younger sister might. (Yes, I know Natasha already has a younger sister.)There\'s another fact you should know at this point, which is that nerds are not, inherently, asexual. We don\'t have much success with women, but that doesn\'t mean we are immune to their charms. Quite the opposite. We fall under such a spell that we are unable to function, and this renders us so unattractive that it creates a self-perpetuating cycle of desperate singlehood.So, in that first moment, 1,000 nerds fell in love with Natasha. Well, 996 nerd guys fell in love with her, and the four women in the crowd thought, ""Wow, I wonder where she got that dress?"" (Laurie Anderson was out partying elsewhere, but I think it\'s safe to assume she would have been crushing, too, had she been present.)As she started to speak a strange calm came over the crowd, as if we were cavemen seeing fire for the first time, or rats hearing a certain piper. There was also some guy in a tux on stage with her, I think. I don\'t know if anyone remembers. Maybe he was tall?Immediately my mind was no longer on whether I won the award, but on what I would say to her if I did. When the first award was given, the guy who won it kept whispering things to her as his product was described to the crowd, and I noticed that her lapel mic was sensitive enough that we could all hear what he was saying. This dashed somewhat my plans to hit on her on-stage, because everyone in the crowd would be able to hear me saying, ""So, uh, want to ride in my car sometime, uh, assuming I move the laundry? I\'ve been led to understand that it\'s, uh, pimp-de-pimp-pimp-pimp.""--When Natasha called out the name of our company for Best User Experience the four of us ran onstage, and I shook her hand as she handed me the cool glowing cube, hand-designed by Jonathan Ives. I think she said, ""Congratulations,"" and if I recall I replied, coyly, ""Thanks."" Playing it smooth... way to go Wil. Don\'t tip your hand yet, old boy. Best to slip in under RADAR. Way under RADAR.Afterwards, the winners all had to come up front to sign a ton of forms in exchange for our phat loot. Natasha was there amongst us, and I recognized that, if ever I would had a chance, this was it. Time to shine!I strode up to her confidently. Ok, well, I didn\'t stride, really, because I pinched a nerve in my neck last month, and ever since I\'ve had to walk kind of hunched over, with my head forward, as if I were a cro-magnan man, or possibly just suffered from osteoporosis. Check it out, ladies! I\'m unevolved and/or very old!The problem is, if I stand up straight, the nerve gets pinched and I lose all feeling in my left arm, and the ability to move it. On the other hand, I knew being hunched over was unattractive, so I kept sort of bending my lower torso backwards to compensate for my bent-forward neck, the end effect being that I bobbed along like a pigeon when I walked.So I coo-cooed up to her and gave her my most winning wince (because I had tweaked the nerve in the bobbing motion). While I admit this isn\'t a word-for-word transcript, this is, I feel, an accurate depiction of what went down:Natasha: ""Congratulations on your win!""Me: ""Nice dress! So pretty! Where dress come from?""Natasha: ""Oh, an assistant and I just ran out to Saks today to get it."" [Note to four women in audience: question answered!] ""Anyways, we\'re all very excited about Delicious Library...""Me: ""Dress soft! Girl pretty!""Natasha: ""Yes... uh, so, it\'s great to have strategic partners like Delicious Monster on our platform...""Me: ""Dress for dancing.

Not every anime needs a revolutionary premise like rock collecting on a cyberpunk Mars. This anime has all the good settings of an isekai: OP reborn MC, focuses on “subtly showing off.” Quality Harem that’s not obnoxious nor unnecessary. And to top it all off, this dabbles into the idea of exorcism, which is a super cool concept to explore. Even the most generic show with the above settings can score a solid 8, and bringing exorcism to the mix could give the show an easy 9 or even a 10.Unfortunately, the show suffers from quite a few...problems:1. Exorcists are so cool! Thank god there isn’t much of it in the show.The first 11ish episodes of the show is half with the MC Seika using his custom exorcism “magic” spells (so pretty much just regular magic), and only half with exorcism powers. Honestly, whenever exorcism powers are involved on whenever summoning is done, the effect and summoned creature is pretty badass and makes you excited to see more, but it’s always the case that those moments are rare and pretty much boring one shots (not saying that just because it one shots it can’t be made to look cool, just look at overlord).2. The hero really doesn’t want to be noticed, except for saving cannon fodder.The show wants to push this agenda that Seika is reluctant to use his powers, except in the case to save his friends. So tell me, how exactly is mass reviving a castle full of fodder knights a justified cause to use his power? Screw Mabel’s brother I guess, can’t have the powerful people discovering that I can revive someone, but I’m sure they won’t notice a mass revive spell casted on a few hundred people (oh, and the knights themself better have short term memory loss…and brother Gly… and the princess).But seriously, if you want show Seika reluctantly unleash more and more of his power, use it on an actual good cause (for the audience). I really don’t care that because Seika felt bad for the princess, he decides to use it to undo the deaths he has caused. To be honest, I’d rather he double down and unleash his power to straight up burn the castle to the ground.3. What a nice cast you have. Let’s add some “friends”.3.1 First character that comes to mind, the Prince dude in the dragon kingdom. Leaving aside the bongcloud that must have been in Seika and Yifa’s heads when they interacted with this prince, the anime really wants us to be fans of NTR where we look at the prince two steps away from probably raping Yifa on the spot, and we… apologies to him and leaves? I swear Seika cares more about the princess he played literally one game of chess with than his lifelong friend and maid Yifa. Hm, funny I should mention the princess because:3.2 The princess is in her own world brewing up a plan, but the anime wants to guilt trip you into thinking, “ah, she is a friend, but Seika doesn’t trust her, how sad for her”, forgetting the fact that it makes perfect sense for Seika to not trust the princess after she literally tried to kill Amyu (if Seika actually said yes and left the castle in the last episode I’m pretty sure I would have dropped at least 3 more points).Also, I am very interest in how the anime explains that Seika lost a chess game vs only king and pawns. It would literally have to be the case that 1) Seika is astonishingly bad at chess, or 2) The princess has some transcendental hax powers that fabricates rules. Because having future sight does not make you have any chance of winning a chess game with only king and pawn against someone who at least know the rules.Overall, this anime suffers from a lot of problem. “The MC is op but never shows it” is a problem in some isekais. This adds another layer with “The MC is op but literally shows it at the worst opportunities”. There’s nothing remarkably positive or negative about other aspects such as animation, sounds or VA. The story actually felt quite slow with some episodes barely having any meaningful content. The next arc seems interesting but I’m doubtful of a season 2.If you are an enjoying of the op reborn isekai genre, then the problems I’ve mentioned above can really be overlooked since the anime does still tick all the boxes, and the breath of exorcism (when present) is undoubtedly very interesting. problems:1.

Until the last episode, there were several events that you didn\'t see coming and that were unusual. Likewise, the protagonist was given some depth through his background. Positive words aside, the anime remains just plain dull average after all, even though I found it interesting from time...to time. The problem is simply that it does everything you do in a weak isekai, except that the story is a bit more mature.The most interesting aspect of the show for me was not just the protagonist\'s use of alternate magic.

However, since the dub casting choice are so limited I've heard this voice actor play a multitude of female characters so can't really hear anything, but a girl the entire time. The Japanese voice acting is a little more ambiguous, which was much more...fitting(although I only watched one scene). Yafi or whatever her name was had a terrible voice. However it overall was pretty average(slightly below) for a dub. Music was fairly average, the couple of scenes where I did noticed it was pretty good. Characters were fine, not very deep. The only character with real depth was the main character, but it wasn't really explored very much. Story was fairly basic, but the main characters mind set made it at least a little better than average. Pacing was fine, there was some episodes that felt like filler, but overall the pacing kept things feeling fresh. That being said I don't feel like we covered a lot of ground. Overall it was acceptable, not very note worthy just kind of meh. Not a waste of time to watch, but I wouldn't call it an anime worthy of your time. 5.80/10 fitting(although I only watched one scene). Yafi or whatever her name was had a terrible voice.

The characters behave more realistically and have more maturity than a lot of other shows of the same kind, and the MC has some unique and dark powers he uses to achieve his goals (sort of reminiscent of Ainz Ooal Gown). The depth of antagonist characters as well, even while brief, is nice and evokes conflicted feelings when they fail, which is cool.While I would recommend this, I wouldn't say it's super. Some plot threads felt a bit unexplored and...cut short, and the one that stood out to me was in the final episode involving the MC + hero and MC's brother + Fiona. Some light SPOILERS here, the conflict arose when the hero (Amyu) got imprisoned by the nation for actions the MC had done. While both the MC and the nation (who Fiona is a princess of) shared fault, there was potential for some real conflict that the previous episodes had built up (both explicitly and retroactively). With the way the story was heading, I expected a tragic impasse which would've been super refreshing in a genre with little feeling of actual stakes. But the conflict came to a rather abrupt and somewhat confusing resolution with things going back to normal. I'm being pretty vague since I want to keep these spoilers light, so I'll liken the conflict and themes to something alike the dilemma Eren Jaeger has in Shingeki no Kyojin.

Will you let a horny rabid dog be alone with your female childhood friend that you holds in high regards? She\'ll potentially get attack and you knew it deep down but just decided to let it be something like ""Yeah you know what? Fuck it she\'ll be fine regardless"".

After getting in contact with Korean & Chinese literatures such as manhwa, manhua, and their webnovels, it became more apparent on how bad really was Japanese male main characters facing their women counterparts.

If being strong, means having the whole world treat you as their enemy, it seems like a better option to stay back in the crowd and conceal your powers. Never again stepping out of the shadows to help anyone ever again.Seika dreamt of having power. A power that would make him the strongest exorcist in the entire world and a power that could help innocent lives from meeting seamless ends. But with this power came the...responsibility of having everyone look at him like a monster. A monster that was on his own rampage and failing in terms of support from the people, he was soon overthrown by his own government, and killed by his own comrades. Thereafter, meeting an unjustified end in a previous life, Seika promises to live his new birth cunningly. One where he now acts smart and thinks by his mind, not his heart, and one where he blends in with the crowd, just going about his daily life like any other person. But for everything that\'s about to come in his life as the reincarnated hero\'s friend, Seika is in for nothing but adventures.This anime stands out for its classic yet unique story. One where we have an overpowered MC that takes the stage unlike anything we have seen before and a story that\'s cleverly written so that by the end, you cannot do anything but wait for the second season. In terms of animation, it is neither too great nor too bad, so with a little better budget for its 2nd season, we can hope to see an amazing classic, of demon lord and hero if this part was amped as well.This anime is recommended for every ""ISEKAI"" anime lover. responsibility of having everyone look at him like a monster.

Despite being an honest and decent person who had loyally served his feudal lord, he was later betrayed by those he was allied with because they feared his strength/power and it being turned...against them if he didn\'t feel like continuing to tow the faction line. For this isekai, the reincarnation is not the traditional ""from a modern world to a fantasy one"", but one from a more medieval world of ""super natural powers"" into a world of ""classical fantasy magic"". So he has some minor advantage in worldly knowledge, but nothing particular regarding ""technology"".Being born into this new world using his own ability he doesn\'t appear to have inherited this new world\'s power, but it doesn\'t matter because he\'s retained his old abilities and summoned familiar\'s contracts which serve him just as well, if not better. Whilst he wishes to hide his true nature as one of the strongest individuals alive when it comes to beyond human powers, he doesn\'t want to take a back seat entirely as a nobody; he still wants to flex himself, but to hide behind someone else more powerful than him as a kind of decoy or mask so that he doesn\'t attract so much attention that he gets killed off again.His first challenge is to overcome family politics to ensure his position within an academy of advanced learning for which he must compete against his 2 other brothers despite multiple handi-caps due to a lack of magical aptitude. The second is to set the stage to be able to hide behind a key individual. As this is occurring, some of this worlds politics start to make themselves known and this upsets him enough to cause him to start gradually taking action against it. The suspension here is that the MC is once again walking down a route that would result in the same ending he wished to avoid; because he refused to allow injustice and would expose himself trying to expose it.By the final act of the season several twists become apparent. Some genuinely interesting political and ethical dilemma\'s become apparent and the tropes of what an isekai protagonist is and does become truly flipped on their head and i don\'t wish to spoil it any further than beyond the fact the last 3 episodes really deviate from the norm into some partly original anti-hero type writing.The season ends relatively tidily, without a major cliff hanger, but does leave room for a sequel which i hope does come because the story has genuinely become interesting and unique at this point. In summary the sound and art design is neither here nor there, but the writing starts off mediocre and grows exponentially in depth.

Etc.', 'The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World is an anime adaptation of a light novel series by Shuichi Tsukishima. It tells the story of Haruyoshi Kuga, a powerful onmyouji (a practitioner of divination, magic, and exorcism) who was betrayed and killed by his former comrades. He used his last breath to cast a reincarnation spell, hoping to find happiness in another world. He was reborn as Seika Lamprogue, the son of a noble family in a world where magic is common. However, he still retained his memories and abilities from his previous life, which surpassed the magic of this world. He enrolled in...a prestigious academy for mages, where he met various friends and foes, and also discovered that he was the hero prophesied to save the world from the Demon King.The anime is a typical isekai (another world) fantasy with some elements of Japanese folklore and culture. It has a lot of action, comedy, romance, and fanservice scenes. The animation quality is decent, but not outstanding. The voice acting is good, especially for the main character, who is voiced by Yuki Kaji, a popular voice actor who also voiced Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan and Meliodas in The Seven Deadly Sins. The music is catchy and fits the mood of the show.The anime has received mixed reviews from critics and viewers. Some praised it for its fun and entertaining plot, its likable and charismatic protagonist, and its creative use of onmyou art (a form of Japanese occultism) in a fantasy setting. Others criticized it for being too generic, clichéd, predictable, and shallow. Some also complained about the excessive fanservice, the lack of character development, and the poor pacing.If you are looking for a light-hearted and enjoyable isekai anime with some unique twists, you might like The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World.

I did not get the point of going to school if the MC is going to be out and about solving mysteries and problems. The school part makes no sense if they are not actually attending school, then they keep introducing characters left and right, so it makes the story even more convoluted and all over the place!!!! Maybe the writer suffers from ADD and in the middle of writing he saw a ""squirrel"" and lost the train of thoughts in between. These stories need to be more focused...I know it is just anime, but still there...is no reason to put trash out there when the story could have been good since the actual main idea was kinda great.

MC Onmyouji is an interesting differentiator that I really appreciated, but I think it could have been better explored.Both the magical system of the anime is poorly explained and poorly explored, but the isekai world magic is very intuitive so it did not become a problem but could be better. The Onmyouji magic is less explained and explored which seems like a flaw since the story is about an Onmyouji. The MC uses a variety of spells but we don't know much about...how it works other than some having similarities to FMA's alchemy.The big problem with this anime is the bad animation.

Because I swear that this exact anime released last year under the title The Strongest Sage with the Weakest Crest. The strongest guy reincarnates himself into the future where he attends a magical *sigh* light novel academy and surrounds himself with a harem of questionably young looking women who are also strong, but not as strong as him, obviously? That’s the exact the same anime!I’m being hyperbolic, obviously. Although they share scarily similar light novel DNA the way The Reincarnation of...the Strongest Exorcist in Another World executes its premise is actually pretty enjoyable… for a while. The first arc is genuinely interesting because being a protag-kun born into a noble family as a child with no talent for magic, he has to balance being seen as powerful and book smart enough to attend noble families magic school number 1,865 and escape his abusive older brother, and keep his life interesting, whilst also not being seen as too powerful so that jealous people don’t try to murder him like they did in his previous life. Whilst the protagonist is so powerful that magic system doesn’t matter because he just destroys everyone in his way no matter who or what that may be thanks to protag-kun’s special boy plot armor, seeing an anime that highlights the differences between Western-based magic and Chinese magic is really cool.Unfortunately, once protag-kun gets to be the irregular at magic high-school, the anime quickly becomes boring. Same old generic demon problem pops up, there’s a character with the title of “tHe HeRo”, theres a tournament arc the protagonist breezes through with no effort and a harem that surrounds him at all times, one of whom is his slave who has feelings for him and I really, REALLY hope I don’t need to explain why thats fucked up… yeah look, it’s just becomes generic light novel nonsense with bare-bones light novel animation you’ve seen a million times before.What’s disappoints me the most about The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World is how by the fantasy light novel books it is. After a great opening arc and a show case of really cool Chinese magic, plus summons like the creepy-as-fuck monkey-thing Satori, who reads peoples minds before eating them, it’s disappointing to see something so promising become another anime in my “dropped” list.4/10 Disappointment. the Strongest Exorcist in Another World executes its premise is actually pretty enjoyable… for a while.

This anime is the perfect template example of the combination of action-focused power fantasy and a bit of supernatural reincarnation spice thrown in for good measure. Except now, the author used a fictional historical Japanese exorcist to be transported to yet another medieval-based otherworld.The show follows the story of an exorcist named Kuga Haruyoshi, who is reincarnated in another world after he dies in a power conflict. As the title suggests, he is the strongest exorcist in...his previous world and, basically, in this new world too. Reincarnated as Seika Lamprogue, he is now a young noble in a renowned family with a lineage of capable magic users.Seika is accompanied by Yifa, one of the Lamprogue slave girls around his age, from early on in his life. Yifa is trained by Seika to be able to harness her magical aptitude. Their adventure in this season mainly focuses on his story of getting into and when he is enrolled in the magic academy. He has a group of quirky friends to \'help\' him along the way. Together, they embark on action-packed adventures that involve Seika hiding his true power behind his friend\'s back to avoid getting assassinated in another power struggle.One of the things that sets this show apart is its premise. The setting of a Japanese exorcist is enjoyable, and the author\'s usage of the possibility of such a role is spot on. It leaves the viewers wanting to know the extent of Seika\'s power compared with his friends. Although to be fair, the addition of romance progression into the mix (and even the choice of pairing him up with only girls) is questionable at best.The animation is good in some scenes. Asking for smooth CG action sequences might be asking for a bit too much. But that definitely would have made the fight scenes more enjoyable to watch. The sound design is not that amazing, either. It has a faulty soundtrack that doesn\'t capture each scene\'s mood.Overall, ""Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki"" is a potential delight of a unique isekai but falls short of the direction and execution of the premise. The spice of a romcom is not entertaining at all. If you\'re a fan of action-focused power fantasy or good old-fashioned (at this point, isekai is an old thing) supernatural hijinks, this show might warrant a watch, even if only for the premise. his previous world and, basically, in this new world too.

We have the same recycled tropes here. Overpowered protagonist with zero personality who behaves like a child, even with a whole lifetime of experience. Harem. Magic School. Hero. Demon King. Ham-fisted demon or elf racism moralizing. No clear oveararching conflict, plot, or antagonist because it\'s designed for only one season, with a vague cliffhanger at the end in case it gets popular enough for a sequel. The gimmick of this particular isekai anime is right in the name. He\'s an exorcist of Japanese lore, so he can do all the exorcist stuff like...throw paper talismans and summon ayakashi monsters. The battles and spell effects are actually the most impressive part of the anime. Unfortunately, they are wasted on short, one-sided fights with no resistance. The show would have been interesting if they had given the plot breathing room instead of allowing the protagonist to merely blink to solve all problems, nipping it at the bud before even allowing it to even bloom. The MC is especially irritating with his smug smile and know-it-all air. The biggest twists in the show are heavily foreshadowed, and the MC constantly contradicts himself in claiming how he wants to keep a low profile, but ultimately just does something flashy. He mostly speaks drivel as logic or even the semblance of wisdom is cast aside on a whim to keep things ""unpredictable"". They try hard to give him a sense of moral ambiguity and the bad boy, anti-hero charm, but he just ends up being an erratic psycho that the other characters won\'t stop characterizing as ""kindness"". It\'s just as bad as every other edgy, anti-hero protagonist from before. throw paper talismans and summon ayakashi monsters.

It\'s just as bad as every other edgy, anti-hero protagonist from before.', 'Another day, another mediocre Isekai...how many of these must we trough our way through before these average shows are the bane of the AniManga industry as it is today, being oversaturated with shit like these?Novelist Kiichi Kosuzu\'s Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki a.k.a The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World, is exactly what it sounds like: the same dumbass power fantasy Isekai that you\'ve seen a thousand times over, wondering why does Japan love the hell about shit like these that the rest of the world know not of its demise. Unfortunately, being people that don\'t dictate how the AniManga industry works, we...the audience only have one thing to do: watch or drop the shows, that\'s the best to give a teeny fraction of our distaste for generic Isekai.Let\'s cut to the chase: the typical case of strong and noble characters, some being backstabbed and betrayed, which so happens to be the case for the world\'s strongest exorcist Haruyoshi Kuga, wanting to achieve an even higher power, at the cost of his very own life. And play the usual Isekai-laden death and reincarnation phase, with Kuga himself reborn as Seika Lamprogue, the usual oddball kid of unusual proportions and a disproportionate level of spirit magic...because that\'s the only generic way of making him stand out. Despite this, Seika is still armed with the elements of his past life: mainly his talisman and Jutsu...because (once again), the MC has always to be built different as such, that in the same way, makes him stand out too...in the most OP-est of ways impossible to be conceived in the fantasy world, because neither his allies nor his enemies understand his mystical techniques.Combine that with the fact that the supporting cast are all Mary Sues on their own right, it feels like an insult to the viewers, not just on the basis of characters being bland for no good reason. You have Yifa the slave (which thinking now, seems counter-intuitive of defining how good or bad a show can be), Amyu the supposed Hero, and Mabel Crane the 3rd-party disguise of the Hero, especially when in the typical world like this of ""heroes vs. demons"" where having one Hero is trouble enough for the Demon Lord\'s army to act. Though Yuki the weasel demon is the exception of beng Seika\'s familiar in the reincarnated world, recognizing that he is her master, the rest of the girls play up on Seika\'s kind-hearted fancy, though Yifa is the closest that she grew up with him, and has the same typical romantic interest as you\'d expect. Bland and generic is what the characters are, with no personality to them.Studio Blanc is a rather small studio with not a lot of shows to their name, though the last work of Summer 2021\'s Uramichi Oniisan is a nice addition. And this production is seemingly like Studio Comet\'s ""Eiyu-Oh"" Isekai show this season, better than it actually deserves with actual work put into the show. Though at the expense of the show itself being generic as molasses, it felt like a +1 on the studio\'s catalogue of potential shows wasted.Probably the only positive about the show is the OP itself. angela\'s ""Reconnection"" is a fairly good song, albeit with rather average visuals, and likewise with the character VAs of Yifa, Amyu and Mabel\'s ED song that is though influenced with the show, just your traditional ""lover\'s (love)song"" with the aforementioned MC Seika himself.Man, to say that this show overall was forgettable is truly an understatement. There were clearly too many Isekai shows this season, and while this show didn\'t exactly hit the bottom of the barrel, though it\'s watchable, it was borderline bad. So, I\'d say: pick your poison and see if you can tolerate the amount of cliché convenience plots that this show has before you ultimately give up the show for what it is.I personally don\'t know why people find this good, but it\'s just legit ""so bad it\'s bad"" trash Isekai. the audience only have one thing to do: watch or drop the shows, that\'s the best to give a teeny fraction of our distaste for generic Isekai.Let\'s cut to the chase: the typical case of strong and noble characters, some being backstabbed and betrayed, which so happens to be the case for the world\'s strongest exorcist Haruyoshi Kuga, wanting to achieve an even higher power, at the cost of his very own life.

Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (ONA),https://myanimelist.net/anime/19469/Saiki_Kusuo_no_Ψ-nan_ONA,"['Believe it or not, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ Nan had the most polarizing effect on me to date, and considering it is of a mere 16 minutes, that is quite something.Now this one is a pretty odd stand-alone episode. The viewer is greeted with the most basics of animation. At first, I thought out to myself ""What the hell? This has drawings worse than that of the two eternal classics, Mars of Destruction and Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven."" The episode starts off with an angsty looking teen whose name is Shun Kaidou who seems like your average shounen MC. His talks are so cryptic as...well as he calls himself the ""Black Wing"", a special boy with supernatural powers whose identity is hidden in order to keep of the ""Dark Union"", a mysterious organization pursuing to get hold of the powers inside of the boy to create a new order in this world-- blah blah blah and what-not. Sounds pretty dumb, right? Well, yes but not so quick...""Don\'t worry, that\'s only a MSSYS (Middle School Second Year Syndrome)."" says the guy with ACTUAL supernatural powers. Honestly, that one scene cracked me up so much that I caught myself saying ""Wait, this is actually... funny"" *LOL*. It wasn\'t so dramatic that I laughed my pants off or something I would remember for days to come, but the sheer unexpectancy of it made me giggle quite a bit. Saiki Kusuo is a guy who actually has powers such as telepathy and uses it to read the minds of people. The other guy, uh... what was his name again? Shun, yes. No, he\'s just a very insignificant side character who has the MSSYS and thinks himself as someone special, and his classmates make fun of him for this too. Coming back to the actual cool MC again, yes, but there\'s a small catch. He can read anyone\'s minds within 200 metres, but there\'s one guy, his classmate Nendou, that he just cannot seem to know what he\'s thinking of. Now this isn\'t some type of rivalry brewing, but its just because that Nendou who is a punk, is actually a dense idiot.There are constant scenes of humor and jokes thrown in between the 16 minute episode, which might not be groundbreaking in comedy, is actually pretty fun.Saiki Kusuo no Ψ Nan is a heavily voice actor driven show. Since the art is so basic and with a very few characters to play around with for a mere 16 minutes, the voice actors have the task to do the dialogues and mix the humor in properly and it works.I only checked this video which I found on Youtube because of the anime adaptation due this Summer. I am totally oblivious to the manga so I had no idea what this stand-alone ONA video was about.

What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL.

Saiki Kusuo is a guy who actually has powers such as telepathy and uses it to read the minds of people. The other guy, uh... what was his name again? Shun, yes. No, he\'s just a very insignificant side character who has the MSSYS and thinks himself as someone special, and his classmates make fun of him for this too.

Sadly, that anime was not this anime. What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5. I liked some things, could've been better.If you're gonna go through the trouble of watching something in this series, you should probably try the 2016 adaptation.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL.

What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting.

Sadly, that anime was not this anime. What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5. I liked some things, could've been better.If you're gonna go through the trouble of watching something in this series, you should probably try the 2016 adaptation.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL. Yeah I did crap on this OVA a lot, but the random noises the characters make alone warrant a 5/10 from me. yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting.

What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art..

It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL.

Sadly, that anime was not this anime. What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL.

It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5. I liked some things, could've been better.If you're gonna go through the trouble of watching something in this series, you should probably try the 2016 adaptation.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL. Yeah I did crap on this OVA a lot, but the random noises the characters make alone warrant a 5/10 from me. yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting.

While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice.

That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives.

While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character?

Sadly, that anime was not this anime. What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5. I liked some things, could've been better.If you're gonna go through the trouble of watching something in this series, you should probably try the 2016 adaptation.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere. If I were to recommend this OVA it would be for the very odd voice acting segments.Overall id say if you are fan of Saiki K, watch the OVA for the wacky voice acting and a free log to your MAL.

What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting.

Sadly, that anime was not this anime. What I watched was Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (TV), the new series based off of the same manga, but done much, much, much differently than this.Story: I honestly love the story. That's probably the best part of this adaptation. It's about a boy with supernatural abilities who just wants to live a normal life, a boy who wants to save the world from some mysterious organization and thinks he has super powers...(In reality he just reads way too much manga) and their daily lives. Daily life animes aren't always the most popular besides a few who have really climbed high, but this story is refreshing. 8/10Art: Sadly everything goes downhill now. The art, oh the art.. I don't think I've seen anything worse in terms of art. If you're willing to get past it you might actually enjoy it, but art is one of the most important themes in creating mood, and that's just thrown out the window here. I would like to argue that it was several years ago and that art wasn't the best back then. But I can't, because this was made in 2013 and for 2013 this really could've been a lot better.. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't even look, but it was dreadful. 2/10Sound: Hard to hear, thank goodness for subs. Didn't pick up on too many background sounds or music. 3/10Character: How much can you really develop in 16 minutes? This did a pretty decent job of showing some characters, but of course it's not perfect. Their designs get in the way again and the art fails us. 6/10Enjoyment: I don't want to be too harsh, because I definitely like the actual premise of the story. It's just the art that brought the downfall. it the art wasn't this bad, I would've enjoyed this a LOT more. Overall, Id rate this a 5. I liked some things, could've been better.If you're gonna go through the trouble of watching something in this series, you should probably try the 2016 adaptation.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere.

The art is absolutely terrible, I have no idea if it was a team that worked on this or just one person. Unlike some bad art spots in the good anime actually making the anime funnier at points, here it doesn\'t add any value to the show. The pacing feels incredibly odd and makes the jokes feel stale. While the actual good Saiki anime feels perfectly paced which makes its jokes land perfectly, this OVA doesn\'t do that. What\'s odd about it is that you KNOW the jokes are funny, but instead of laughing you tell...yourself in your head, ""This would be so funny in the original anime series"".An interesting thing about this OVA actually is the Voice Acting. Saiki I actually question if he was voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in this OVA or not (probably should have done the research) but if its not him then the VA did a great job at slightly recreating his voice. The voice actor for Nendou is hilarious. There are some scenes where I burst out in laughter because the noises the VA makes are so damn hilarious. Maybe its pretty fitting for that character? The side characters also make some hilariously odd noises that come out of nowhere.

Kiratto Pri☆chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37178/Kiratto_Pri☆chan,"[""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols.

(though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata.

Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great.

Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough.

I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go.

But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully).

There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun.

Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.)

But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10."", ""Just for some backstory, I'm not one for idol animes, so this one was among my first. I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless! CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on.

I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best.

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case.

Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case.

Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising.

Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols.

Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to.

Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols.

But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means.

I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show.

This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows.

My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go.

Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully).

The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at.

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable.

I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series.

It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story.

I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case.

Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case.

Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising.

Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols.

Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols.

Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case.

She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard.

In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion.

In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit.

I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about."", ""Oh Kiratto, how much potential you had... and mostly wasted.STORY: 6/10This is, perhaps, the worst part of all. Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways.

Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at.

But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable.

I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series.

It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story.

I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!"", ""When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan.You could almost...say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome.Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list?Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong)To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show.Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses.Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent.The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not?There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me.All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime?Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog.Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about. say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits.

Unlike similar series, where each episode brings a new challenge or arc, Kiratto insisted on shoving the same generic issues at the audiences' faces, over and over and over again. The show just never evolved, which in turn, seriously held the characters back.Every similar series makes sure to show their characters working hard, working out, training, studying, taking things seriously - but Kiratto seemed utterly determined to keep their characters silly, stupid, and just having fun. There were a few moments of real work, but they were...just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried. Not very hard, but they did.Sara is unique - the queerbaiting with her is frankly insane - while Anna shows depth at surprising and unexpected times. But Mirai, our lead, is painfully naive and shallow, while Emo's catch phase is both incredibly annoying and utterly meaningless, along with almost everything else she tries her hand at. Poor Rinka does her best to hold everyone together, and is frankly the only interesting character of the bunch, having a 'mysterious' background and fun arc, yet ultimately gets the least screen time.Nobody in the cast grows up, learns, or evolves (except for Rinka.) They're rarely challenged by anyone outside of their inner circle, and  when they do, they win with ease. It's boring, and the characters' rivalries quickly feel stale and forced.ART: 8.5If there's one thing the Pretty franchise has over Aikatsu, it's always going to be the art (and as far as Kiratto goes, absolutely nothing else.)The CGI is gorgeous, with good choreography and an impressive variety, complete with great backdrops and smart 'camera' work. Plus, this is the first Pretty series where ALL the dresses are at least decent - there's no ugly clown-frog suits to be seen this time. In 2d, their dresses are just as adorable and well designed, each girl genuinely looks unique from the last, the backgrounds manage to be both detailed and not distracting, and everything is just excessively cute.SOUND: 7Don't get me wrong here - what they do have, they do exceptionally well at. It's all catchy, poppy, and fun. But that's the ONLY thing they ever do. Compared to Aikatsu and LoveLive and basically any other idol show out there, which have rock and ballads and folk music, Pripara's playlist is just, well, boring.OVERALL: 6.25I'll give it a quater point for the amazing art, but between the repetitively bland storylines, flat characters, and generally boring playlists, this series definitely earned a 6/10. just that - moments, nothing more.CHARACTERS: 6.5/10Well, they tried.

I was bored of all the series I was watching at the time so I decided to just pick something random and hope for the best. I ended up watching Kiratto Pri☆chan for a few hours, and whilst I don't regret it, it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.Spoiler-free review.__A TL;DR for those who don't want to read a full review:PROS:- Cute character designs- Easy to watch, doesn't involve a lot of concentration to understand the story- Multiple seasons...CONS:- Story-line is repetitive- Not a lot of character development- No relatable characters- Music gets boring after a whileMIXED:- Generic art style__Story: 6/10Like others have stated, this was probably the least enjoyable aspect of the series. The show had a lot of potential, but the creators seemed more focused on silliness and fanservice. It's obvious that this show isn't meant to be watched seriously, but it was a bit too much and definitely needs to be toned down a considerate amount.However - if you're looking for a light anime to keep on whilst you study or complete other tasks but still be able to focus on every so often, then this is definitely for you.Art: 5/10I didn't find anything particularly special about the art. It was good, but rather generic and not entirely memorable. It doesn't really stand out.Sound: 6/10Once again, it doesn't really stand out.The majority of the music has the same vibe. It's upbeat, catchy and fun to listen to. Which isn't inherently bad, but I would've liked to see some variation perhaps with the other idol groups at least.Characters: 7/10I found the character very enjoyable. Whilst some may argue their designs are basic and don't stick out much from most other high-school based shows, I think they all fit their personalities and places in the show.The main thing that's stopping me from giving it a higher score is the lack of character development, even for the main characters. The development they do get is very predictable and doesn't do much for the story. They're all very flat - apart from maybe Anna and Rinka.Conclusion: 6/10This show is fun and easy to watch, but I would not recommend it for those who are trying to find something deep and entertaining to focus on. Its pretty much your basic high-school idol anime, just more repetitive.This is one of my first reviews on here, so I apologise if it was awkward, repetitive or boring. I'm currently struggling with writers block and I'm trying to break out of that by writing things that differ from my usual style. But I hope it helped nonetheless!
