Anime Himitsu no Hanazono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2810/Anime_Himitsu_no_Hanazono,"[""This anime is my 1st childhood favorite tv series. I don't know if it's just because I'm still young at that time or the story is really great but as what I remembered I always feel magical everytime I remember the garden in the story. Just lately I found myself having the urge to watch the old anime tv series during my childhood years so my first series that wanted to watch is this.As I watched the first 5 episodes in the anime I concluded that the story is great not because I'm still young at that time but because the story and the animation...is great as it is. Too bad I only found 5 episodes with dubbed in my country language and I found the complete list but there's no English subtitles. Maybe if I can't wait for the English subtitles to be done by someone who can translate then I will watch the anime without subtitles. I'll just guess what they are saying and by just watching it will do in satisfying my yearning for this series.Story: 10/10The story is great with moral lesson.Art: 7/10The art may not be that great compared to anime today but it's still quite good to watch. Also Mary Lennox facial expressions is so adorable whether she is angry, mad, sulky or happy.Song/Voice: 8/10I love the way they voiced the anime. It adds to the feels on the characters. The song is well suit to the anime.Characters: 10/10The characters fulfills their role where we can get lessons if we just attentively see and understand them.Overall: 10/10This anime is great.I just hope that someone pick this up and put English subtitles so that someone like me can also understand what they are saying so that all of us can be happy. is great as it is.

Mary Lennox, although she did not realize it, she lived a miserable life, but thanks to a change she managed to have a happy life.Mary Lennox lived in India with her parents. But she was practically forgotten by them. When a cholera epidemic struck India, all the employees all the inhabitants of Mary’s house died. All that time Mary was locked in her room, so she survived (quarantines work, even in fiction). Mary is going to the UK to live with her uncle, Mr. Craven, a widower who keeps several secrets in her...mansion.What I like about this anime is that it made a great job adapting the book. Adding characters, new stories and character development that the book doesn’t have. Mary is very curious about her new environment. She can easily make new friends and also has to learn about tolerance and patience not ignoring some secrets her mother had. The anime can be slow comparing to the book, but this can be an advantage to the anime.The music is quite good, but generic. The opening is really lively and happy. The animation, for that year (1991) is nice. The animation can be also generic, but did a great job in every episode. mansion.What I like about this anime is that it made a great job adapting the book.

Beyblade Burst God,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34901/Beyblade_Burst_God,"['I enjoyed watching this anime.It is not the best because not consistent story and some mistakes and too much ""why"" and ""how"", but I like to watch this type of anime for relaxation and joy. It really keeps me intense and it is very easy to start to like characters. But if you don\'t put your head too much into it it get\'s great.I used to watch Beyblade from childhood so I love it still.Story is about Aoi Walt going on world tournament and Kurenai Shou starting to act wierd and becomest main villain.I really love the art of this anime...and look of the characters, they are simply adorable. Tho, a big minus is that there is just a bit of character development. and look of the characters, they are simply adorable.

I watched this on TV every episode and i thought it wasa just another cartoon but way better and then i found out about anime and i really liked that this was my first exposure to anime. Altough it was seem childish it was fun to watch. It was a great first anime.My Review of the anime (No Spoilers!)The story was great. 10/10The art style was just like any other anime (no offense) 9/10The charecters had nice scenes. Their personality really fits their design.Im not sure how they react...to situations. 9/10Im sure more young audiences will enjoy this anime.

So he joins the team BC Sol from Spain.The premise is Valt and his team battling bladers from around the world and rising to the top once again.I'll be honest, Evolution was a letdown for me. A lot of people liked it but I couldn't get into it....A majority of the show takes place inside BC Sol's HQ and there's just too much teenage drama.I get this is a show aimed at kids but it's just too dramaish. The new characters like Stan aren't likable.A lot of returning characters from BURST appear and you'll see them in matches again.There's just something about Evolution compared to Burst I just don't like.Valt is still a likable character and seeing him on the world stage is cool but it feels too Shonen. It feels too action based and suffers from the problems Metal had.The episodes are fine but sometimes they're flat out silly like a guy using a bey made of stone.The animation feels like a downgrade compared to BURST but that could just be me. Sound is fine.If you want to continue Valt's journey then sure. Go watch EvolutionPersonally? I just couldn't get into it.

Even within world championship, there's never been any competitive female blader spotted around. Each and every female bladers in burst series always play as side role character instead of being equally competitive as male bladers. The non competitive bladers characterized as a bladers that use random bey composition and parts, instead of having its own beyblade that differ from other bladers.In Bakuten series, we are familiar with Emily with her trygator, queen with her gabriel, and many other competitive female bladers with exclusive beyblade to her own. Even during metal...fight series, there is a character like Hikaru with her Wind Aquario, Sophie with her Grand Cetus, and many more female bladers still considered as being competitive and able to stand competitively against unknown bladers.It is sad to see that each and all females bladers in the burst series always include as those unknown bladers in previous era, especially to see the fact that world beyblade series 2018 has female blader as its finalist. It is sad, to see something as such was never existed in its anime version. Therefore, what I see in the current Beyblade series is no more than a lust of selling and promoting its toy and accesories, the scene of battle intensivied to present the perspective while the character, setting and story development greatly cut to serve those purpose.After considering those factors, 5 is the best score that I can give while the other remaining burst series receive 4 at best.

Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040,https://myanimelist.net/anime/568/Bubblegum_Crisis_Tokyo_2040,"[""Bubblegum Crisis 2040 is quite an oddball series, it was something I really enjoyed watching simply for the fact that it's rather unique and there's just not a lot out there quite like it. Simply put it was a nice break from your everyday typical anime, harem, mecha, comedy, fantasy, whatever.2040 is an indirect sequel to the original Bubblegum Crisis (sometimes with the additional &quot;2032&quot; or just &quot;OVA&quot; thrown at the end there). They're alternate versions of each other therefore nothing is really connected, other than the fact that they're different stories with some of the same characters in the same setting and whatnot....Because of this I'll make a few comparisons here and there between the two. The biggest difference between them is that the OVA was mainly episodic based and 2040 is not, containing more of a single overarching plot.STORY: The year is obviously 2040 where Tokyo has been reborn after a devastating earthquake that took out the majority of the city, to rebuild such a complex place once again humans needed something to help them. A powerful company by the name of Genom comes into play here and introduces the &quot;Boomers&quot;, humanoid mech's built with the sole ideal to help rebuild and restore the most technological advanced city in the world, in which they ended up calling Mega Tokyo. These Boomers came in many packages, some would look like giant trackers of sorts that handled construction, while others would look totally identical to human beings, handling jobs such as a receptionist and whatnot. However being built in such haste the Boomers were not without their fault and at times, went berserk causing chaos and destruction throughout the city, but Genom had such a strong hold on Mega Tokyo that nobody could bring about the end of the Boomers construction. In an attempt to stop these outbreaks the Advance Police Forces, or AD Police for short, was born. Genom ends up taking things even further by diving into illegal trade and develops combat Boomers and various other things, eventually becoming quite an issue. Can the AD Police alone stop this crisis?In comes Sylia Stingray, daughter of the infamous Dr. Stingray who helped build the foundation of the Boomers in the first place. However, she wants nothing more than to see the end of their production and very existence for unknown reasons. She is an incredibly wealthy billionaire with a close friend Nigel whom is an incredibly skilled engineer and mechanic. She gives birth to the powerful mobile armor dubbed &quot;Knight Sabers&quot; that can only be worn by a very select few women. Fate eventually brings all these girls together in an effort to fight against the Boomers. Originally it was nothing but a friendly competition between the AD Police and the Knight Sabers, but eventually things start to go deeper. What really caused the earthquake that happened many years ago? Is their a source to all the Boomer outbreaks? Where exactly do the Knight Saber suits come from? What is Sylia's true motive? All these questions eventually come into play as the story becomes more than just straight up action against Boomers.But that's also where the series slightly derails, about a 3rd or 4th of the way in they throw the philosophical card at you and the show ends up trying to be &quot;deep&quot;. Luckily, it doesn't seem to go too over the top with this and doesn't try to shove tons of silly ideas or anything down your neck. The ideals and questions presented are nothing that'll really make you scratch your head over, but at the same time they shouldn't completely bore you out of your mind either. Regardless I clearly believe they could've taken a different route and thrown out the last arc of the story here for something much better. The main thing I got out of these last parts was the emphasis on self discovery.CHARACTER: The character development is definitely a huge improvement compared to the OVA and overall done very nicely. However (I'll blame the last story arc), you are kind of left wanting to see them develop a little more towards the end, like they were just a little unfinished or something. But anyways, each main character here definitely has their own traits: Priss is the rogue whom does as she pleases and doesn't like people holding her back, Lina comes off as the strong willed girl who will do anything to get to the top, Nene is the odd and spunky younger one that should never be underestimated when it comes to the technical stuff, and Sylia is the cheerful yet oh so mysterious leader whom might leave you in the dark at times, but you'll get your answers eventually. Okay, so they all don't sound incredibly interesting on paper here but they certainly do change throughout the series mainly for the better and the odd bunch does manage to eventually cope together very well, they make an excellent team. At first the series focuses entirely on the rookie Lina and I actually liked this direction, however the focus later shifts back to Priss and is handled pretty smoothly, but it's almost annoying that in the end Lina is the one character that you're kind of left wanting to know more about, not to mention she ends up being &quot;alone&quot; unlike the rest of the crew. Also I have to stress the fact that while Priss may seem like the typical ignorant &quot;I don't speak to you because I don't care&quot; kind of character done way too much in anime, she does soften up a bit and let out emotions, she does develop and change. Also, every character got a makeover and in all honesty I prefer them all over the originals, just simply put I guess. Though yeah, Lina's headband was awesome.Aside from this a handful of other characters return like the mysterious villain Mason, Sylia's younger brother with a lost past, and most noticeably the head of AD Police, big shot Leon whom loves to hate the Knight Sabers. Just like the rest of the main chicks here, Leon's character gets fleshed out a lot more here than it did in the OVA and even in the spinoff AD Police Files. There's actually a lot of humor revolved around him and Nene's interactions (with her being a AD Police operator of sorts). Just don't call him &quot;Leon-chan&quot;! And overall, you can expect some great humorous moments throughout the show. Some might be really cheesy at times, but they never feel too tacky or pointlessly thrown in. Along with this you can also expect some romances though the scenes with these elements are a hit or miss, some worked, and some just felt really awkward.ART/ANIMATION: In all honesty I was really impressed with the animation here and the character designs mainly for its time and for being a full length normal series. I really don't think there's a lot of late 90's early 00's releases that faired too well in the art/animation department. This was the time when some companies were trying new things, some were throwing in horrendous CG (at the time especially), a lot of the hand drawn detail was being lost, but none of that is really the case with 2040 here. They did an excellent job with the fight scenes, never throwing in some of those annoying panning images, or repeating scenes relentlessly, and this isn't an older show where you'll get the characters mixed up or anything like that, I'm sure we've all seen some of those?Being a cyberpunk series one should definitely expect a darker, futuristic, more downbeat, gritty setting and they definitely nailed that aspect pretty well. The atmosphere is easily there. Overall though, it's not quite as inspired and incredibly detailed like the original OVA. I'm assuming it could be because of budget differences with this being a longer series or just the fact that, a lot of older cyberpunk shows are superior when it comes to the art and detail even compared to newer releases, a lot more hand drawn stuff when into them. If you're expecting some epic Blade Runner-esque influences here, well you'll see some here and there, but influences are not nearly as prominent as they were in the OVA and other older cyberpunk anime. All in all, the series manages to give off a great darker and even sometimes depressing vibe, which is good enough.Boomers/Mech Design: Unfortunately this is another slight downfall when compared to the original. The Boomer designs in this one were really not that inspiring at all and rather generic, even when they got bigger and more powerful, they weren't that detailed or interesting as the stuff you'd see in the OVA. In the OVA there was typically a single super powerful Boomer per episode and they were always incredibly detailed and really creative, but here you could almost classify all the enemies as just &quot;typical robots&quot; or whatever. After watching the OVA and then this afterwards, this was probably one of my biggest disappointments actually. The same can be said about the Knight Sabers second suits that they end up getting here towards the end of the show... not to mention the way they had to put them on, was just downright weird.MUSIC: Everyone who knows anything about the Bubblegum Crisis OVA series knows that it was pretty infamous for having a rockin' big hair styled metal soundtrack with tons of vocal tracks that, while aged and so &quot;totally 80's&quot;, really gave the series a lot of its charm and character. Sadly, this is where 2040 suffers quite a bit. Fans of the original going in expecting anything to match up to &quot;Hurricane Tonight&quot; or whatnot will probably be very disappointed. Yes, Priss does have a few vocal tracks here and there and while they're certainly fun, they don't stand out very much on their own unlike a lot of the tracks from the original OVA.The actual background OST here is mainly a mixed bag. I thought some of the darker and slower tracks typically played at more dramatic, mysterious, or emotional segments fit the mood pretty well, but there's really nothing offered here in this department that manages to be really memorable when it's all said and done. It's certainly not bad but, after something like Bubblegum Crisis' OVA you'd surely expect to find a top notch OST here and sadly that's not really the case.MAIN ISSUE? At times the show probably could've taken itself a little more seriously and done well, instead I thought there was an issue with a few scenes that just ended up being anticlimatic. This happened a lot during difficult situations or when the Knight Sabers took on incredibly powerful Boomers, when you think all was lost, they sometimes end up doing something that seems so incredibly simple you'll wonder why they didn't do so in the first place. But hey, overall this is really just one of those fun laid back shows that's all about the action, the quirky characters and odd humor, and the cool setting. So I wouldn't say that's a huge deal if you go in with a cool head here.OVERALL: Bubblegum Crisis 2040 was again, a really great break from the norm with some solid production value to back it up. If you're a sci-fi buff that likes a lot of action, especially when it's women kicking some ass, with a fairly straightforward plot that won't make you think too much, then you should definitely be in for a treat here. If you liked the original OVA any bit at all I highly recommend watching this series as well to compare the two. They both have their ups and down when you pit them together but if you liked one at all, chances are you'd get some enjoyment out of the other. Bubblegum Crisis and its sequel are excellent series that surely inspired other cyberpunk anime that followed them, not to mention several spinoffs including stories revolved around the AD Police and Parasite Dolls stemmed from here, while both aren't groundbreaking in anyway, it does go to show how successful the OVA and 2040 were. Good ol' sci-fi anime. Because of this I'll make a few comparisons here and there between the two.

Good ol' sci-fi anime."", ""At a glance, Bubblegum Crisis seems to be just about girls with suits kicking butt, but in reality this is one amazing anime.The story takes place in a post earthquake Tokyo where robots are used in mass amounts to assist with everything from being waiters to construction workers.  Of course these robots dont always do what they're told, and its up to the knight sabers to step in.The characters in this show are all amazingly created and very distinct from each other.  The four main girls are have very different personalities which makes for great character interaction not only in battles but in...everyday life.the story starts off as some &quot;vigilantes&quot; beating up some robots but the story stretches very far beyond that to tell what becomes a very epic sci fi/action tale that for the most part has a serious tone to it, the more the show goes on, the darker things get.The battles are usually pretty cool to watch, especially with all the neat things that the knight sabers can do.  The overall art work is done exceptionall well, it has a very clean look to it, and everything has details.the sound experience is pretty good, everything from the mechanical noises to the rockin soundtrack helps enhance the show.This show will keep you watching until the end, and its a great ride all the way there.And for those wondering wtf the title has to do with anything, a bubblegum crisis is a problem that starts off small but gets bigger and bigger like a bubblegum bubble until it bursts and all hell breaks loose, which is a very fitting title for the show. everyday life.the story starts off as some &quot;vigilantes&quot; beating up some robots but the story stretches very far beyond that to tell what becomes a very epic sci fi/action tale that for the most part has a serious tone to it, the more the show goes on, the darker things get.The battles are usually pretty cool to watch, especially with all the neat things that the knight sabers can do.

It seems logical that remaking something that is so stylish would be going in waaaay over your head. And yet here we are! A good remake! Instead of trying to copy everything that made the original good and surely failing. It found its own strengths by taking the core of the original and doing something different, like a good remake should.The year is 1998. Bubblegum Crisis 2040 was made into a 26 episode show presumably after AIC won the whole legal rights  debacle by slicing the head of their former...co-producers and absorbing their powers.  Priss and the gang are back. Although obviously looking a bit different time around. They\'re still fighting boomers. And they still aren\'t exactly fans of the shady mega corporation Genom. That\'s the familiar core brought back.A lot of the characters have changed though. With 26 episodes to work with there\'s no shortage of time to characterize them all. Unlike the original who only really bothered to characterize Priss and Nene properly. In this adaptation those two are more or less the same as the original. Priss being the cool and somewhat detached ace and Nene being the cutesy hacker working as their inside man in the AD Police. Linna actually gets to have a character this time around! Not only that but the show starts it\'s very first episode from her perspective as the idealistic small town girl going to Tokyo to get the most cyberpunk job of all. A shitty office job. High tech low life indeed. Still she wants to join the Knight Sabers that she heard about on the internet. As the devious Genom makes sure that the news don\'t report to them they\'re just a rumor. Sylia is given a new lease on life as a more mysterious ( with a mystery that\'s actually clearly explained this time around ) and tortured character with a seemingly personal vendetta towards boomers that plays a big part into the story.  Yes! You heard me right. Story! This show actually tells a complete story from beginning to end unlike the original. Now I absolutely don\'t want to spoil any of it because it\'s quite a ride once it\'s set everything up. Although if you\'re at all familiar with the works of Chiaki Konaka who had a hand with the script of this series you can probably guess that it occasionally goes in some weird and dark directions. Not only that but they finally finished reading the ""world building 101"" book that they only briefly looked at in the original by actually showing the boomer working class that was so critical to the rebuilding efforts  this time around ( although Crash did show some worker boomers as well ). Showing the general disdain that regular people seem to have towards boomers. Additionally Genom and Mason\'s motivations are a little more clear this time around too instead of just infinite resources to throw at anything and zero strategy other than being shady and shadowy for the sake of it. The story and characters is the one place where the remake clearly and unequivocally beats the original as it actually bothers to explain itself and expand on things rather than just bringing things up and then forgetting about it such as Priss\' hatred for the AD Police for example.Even though now AIC is way too busy coasting on it\'s former glories and IPs to make new and original shows. A fate that is tragically too common with old school studios. Back then at least it seems the studio had some smarts and probably knew they couldn\'t make this show as ultra stylish as the original, and instead playing to it\'s strength in the writing department. After all the OVA had months in between episodes to perfect its Blade Runner worshiping aesthetic instead of a TV schedule to deal with for one. If they tried I have no doubt it would\'ve failed completely. Instead they settle for the tried and true classic 90\'s realism for their character designs. Although your mileage may vary when it comes to the redesign of the classic characters. I think the Priss redesign with the kind of spiky hair and sharper eyes captures the rebellious spirit of the original fairly well. The boomer designs are also more creative than the bootleg Terminators hidden in Genom secret service types that the original was so fond of. Everything from waitress boomers to Metal Gear style military boomers go mad.  As they go mad they also grow monstrous and even eldritch looking at times. Liquid metal. I guess they updated from Terminator to Terminator 2 now that I think about it. Just because it\'s nowhere near as stylish as the original doesn\'t mean it looks bad.  I prefer the 80\'s aesthetic of the old show and it\'s more detailed and alive looking take on the city.  But it\'s certainly not without it\'s visually striking moments however. Though they mostly save those for around the end. The show is at it\'s most stylish when it\'s visually darker and shadowy in an almost horror-like manner. Perfectly complementing the monstrous boomers and making the Knight Sabers\' opponents much more intimidating. Besides everyone knows sunlight and good lighting are the most un-cyberpunk thing in the world. It\'s animated well enough and fairly consistent. I only noticed one very odd slip up with Genom\'s chairman occasionally not moving his lips while talking for some strange reason. I guess Genom works in mysterious ways. Otherwise it\'s clear that care, polish and talent went into the series.For the soundtrack you\'re getting served up some rock music. Just in case episode titles such as ""Are You Experienced"" ""We Built This City"" and ""Shock Treatment"" didn\'t clue you in. Although more alt rock and even sometimes industrial than the dad rock that the titles would suggest, some of them even being dad rock back in 98\'. But atleast they didn\'t reference REO Speedwagon. I\'m pretty sure it was mandated by international law to downtune your guitar in the 90\'s so you\'re getting a lot of that. For garnish you might get some acid bleeps and bloops that sounds like they came straight from a 303. Since Priss is still in a rock band she gets to play some songs too. But here I have to absolutely stress that you\'re not getting some sort of Konya Wa Hurricane showstoppers or even sequences where she gets to play a whole song while other stuff happens in some sort of montage. And even though I find the soundtrack to this show to have some good songs and it fits the tone of the show quite well ( I really like the OP song Y\'know. The suspiciously sampled drums are delicious ) it comes up painfully and even embarrassingly short when compared to the lavish soundtrack of the original where the hits just kept on coming.  AIC was probably aware of this and made the soundtrack more low key than the 80\'s excess original to avoid comparisons. Although I doubt it helped their case all that much. Priss\' preformances are instead kept very short, presumably just as some sort of lipservice to the original. Or maybe to show that she has a hobby other than riding her officially mandated red cyberpunk motorcycle and being aloof.I did love this show though. I was very fascinated by the mysteries that the series set up very early on. Such as Sylia\'s past and her volatile reaction and emotions towards boomers. And that even almost 10 years later Nene is still best girl. Of all things they even gave an explanations for why the Knight Sabers are all female, y\'know besides the fact that they\'re more marketable that way. It\'s pacing is kind of deliberate in the beginning . And it keeps some of it\'s cards close to it\'s chest until the very end. But it all leads up to something special let\'s just put it that way.As much as I love 80\'s anime aesthetic. And I know there\'s a lot of people out there that does too ( although they\'re not really to be found on great numbers on MAL ) keep in mind that not everything has to be made exactly like they did back then. There\'s joy to be had in exploring the different takes of different eras has on genres. It\'s a beauty that all mediums hold, not just anime. Ignorant nu schoolers that only watch seasonal stuff should definitely go back and watch the classics to actually get some sort of basic understanding of the medium they claim to love and it\'s rich history that might be lost if the community keeps going the way it is right now. And bitter old schoolers obviously needs to stop the Miyazaki style rambling and actually watch some good shows instead of just cherry picking the high school slice of shlock shows as examples. Unless they\'re mech-heads ofcourse then I\'ll pass them a 40\' and bow my head with them in remembrance of when Sunrise used to be good studio. co-producers and absorbing their powers.

While this take on Bubblegum Crisis didn\'t really wow me, there were aspects of it which made me enjoy it more over the OAV series. The series still features Sylia and the Knight Sabers dealing with mad boomers and corrupt activity within the Genom corporation with the girls still a likeable bunch.The characterizations with many of the prominent characters have changed a bit from their 80s counterparts with how you enjoy...them depending on how you liked them ten years earlier. Here are some examples:1. Sylia mostly works in a supporting role with the Knight Sabers for this series and isn\'t so stoic in this spinoff as she has angry mood swings whenever the subject of Genom is brought up.2.  Priss is more aloof in Tokyo 2040 as she keeps distant from the other Knight Sabers throughout much of the series, along side potential love interest and AD Police officer Leon who isn\'t as smooth-talking as he was in the OAV.3. Sylia\'s brother, Mackie, is more polite, plays a bigger role in this series and isn\'t prone to perversion as his 80s counterpart.The series does expand on its back story on Sylia so we come to know what connects her to the boomers, why she opposes Genom and how she formed the Knight Sabers, a major improvement over the OAV. The major characters that represent Genom aren\'t completely evil either as the chairman of the company aspires for humanity and boomers to coexist, Brian Mason having enough depth where he has justification for his actions against the chairman\'s orders and boomers being used for more mundane purposes besides military use. The series starts off at first as a ""monster of the week"" type plot where the Knight Sabers deal with a random mad boomer in each episode. However as Mason\'s goals slowly start to unravel, his plans kick in during the second half of Tokyo 2040 to start off an engaging ongoing plot as said plans jeopardize more than the people of Mega Tokyo. With the original Bubblegum Crisis being notable for its soundtrack, the music for Tokyo 2040 is given as much love here with its mix of rock and techno musical tracks that blend in quite well with the everyday and tense scenes seen throughout the series. And while shortcuts with the animation were apparent for me, character designs and scenery were well drawn with a good amount of detail.The series isn\'t without its flaws however. Like the original series, I still found the other Knight Sabers to be quite underdeveloped compared to what we learn about Sylia. In addition, the quality of the plotting for the final episodes to the series left quite a bit to be desired for me as deus ex machina seemed to take place for the Knight Sabers to overcome a seemingly powerful foe and it becomes a bit too centered on making Priss into the heroine who saves everyone in the end. I was also left with some questions over what happened in the series finale with events and characters.While not the major improvement I was hoping to get out of the Bubblegum Crisis franchise, Tokyo 2040 still offered enough with its plot and characters to give it a better quality feel for me than the more style-driven OAV series. them depending on how you liked them ten years earlier.

Along with the work from Studio AIC and director Hiroki Hayashi, both whom worked on everything Tenchi from before could go in either direction from classic to bust much like Tenchi.Set in a futuristic society compared to the likes of Blade Runner, manual labor is done by organic robots called Boomers. These Boomers are made by a corporation by the name of Genom. One fateful day, office worker Lina sees one of these Boomers rage out of control and morph into some crazy monstrosity. Her...goal from the beginning was employment in the big city and join some Boomer fighting group called the Knight Sabers. Needless to say she ends up joining this group to fight the rogue Boomers as well as escaping the specific police division created to also stop raging Boomers.The series as a whole still mostly holds up animation wise and plenty of action makes Bubblegum Crisis palatable. Music, plot, and characters are mostly forgettable unfortunately. Music and sound just have not aged well or is better stuck in the late 90’s as the techno-rock fits the show but not the test of time. A plot that just seems to be put on the back end, and suffered from many filler-like episodes until the last few to just wrap up the story hastily. Where Bubblegum Crisis should have been strong in its characters is the most disappointing aspect. The series never develops them properly, and much reasoning behind character’s actions are left with simple reasons with fairly dull results. Lina as the main character gets some backstory, but due to the rest of the female team having almost none makes the viewer just not seem invested enough either with the story or the Knight Sabers.Basically, this new Bubblegum Crisis is ok for an action series, ok for some strong female characters, fine for attempting a decent plot, and fine as an anime. It’s different in regards to most other anime, but is just missing something in order for it to make the jump from fine to good. goal from the beginning was employment in the big city and join some Boomer fighting group called the Knight Sabers.

I maybe overhyped it in my mind about the bubblegum reboot, and well after it all i had mixed feeling about it.To begin with is some of the roles of some minor charachters that has been revised  from the original ova, but the four knight sabers wich pretty much stay in the same role though i felt that 2...of the 4 knightsabers got a bit of an ´stereotypical  cuddly japanese highschoolgirl giggley´type that can e annoying over time.The story overall was  a indirect reboot set in the same setting, different beginning  but gave it a more ´extended´storyline and i liked the somewhat dark plotsetting after half of the serie´s.and a more personal inside look a most of the protagonists unlike the ova.But throuhgout the serie´s there are some factors that fails in this show or rely too much on it.The animation for its time looked quite ok,  a 90´s look to the knight sabers and a inproved A.D police look not so much problems there ofc. Musicwise they relyed a bit too much on the action to put the right track into it, as well that it was mostley a repetitive Technolike bouncing music at most of the episode´s. Priss singing here was just not the same to me and the rockmusic was dull to me, nothing compared to the EXPLOSIVE intro of the original Bubblegum crisis and further. Only at episode 25&26 it went to a right direction and i mean during the explanation of how boomers came to be ( for the time beeing) . Mackey´s  role , one of the knight sabers younger brother is revised here from a peeking dirty boy,;)  into some sort of émotionless technofreak with no substance whatsoever ): .The boomers on the other hand had a more intelligent look and feel to it, but in the 1987 ova´s they were more bloodthirsty and vicious.Overall i wished that most of the chara kept the same role, liked the extended storyline but was put off a bit because of the repetitive music over half the serie´sand , well to me it had its moments but thats it! of the 4 knightsabers got a bit of an ´stereotypical  cuddly japanese highschoolgirl giggley´type that can e annoying over time.The story overall was  a indirect reboot set in the same setting, different beginning  but gave it a more ´extended´storyline and i liked the somewhat dark plotsetting after half of the serie´s.and a more personal inside look a most of the protagonists unlike the ova.But throuhgout the serie´s there are some factors that fails in this show or rely too much on it.The animation for its time looked quite ok,  a 90´s look to the knight sabers and a inproved A.D police look not so much problems there ofc.

Thus, I have a soft spot for an anime like Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 that, while flawed in some respects, I still think is a semi-intelligent, entertaining romp through an underdeveloped science fiction world.It’s the year 2040 (duh) and Linna Yamazaki has gone from her comfortable life in the country to a crazy life as...a businesswoman in Tokyo. Almost immediately she drops a hamburger when a rude motorcyclist drives by and rather than let it go, she chases down the motorcycle like a nutcase. Eventually she meets up with the motorcyclist, Priss, who belongs to a Power Ranger-esque group known as the Knight Sabers. Linna ends up joining them in their fight against rampaging boomers (the anime’s name for robots).For me, the anime starts pretty slow and formulaic, introducing a diverse foursome while also opening up the world. Typically this works but I found the world to be pretty generic and only contain a few sci-fi ideas sprinkled throughout to justify the main plot. At one point Linna plugs a magazine into a machine which turns last month’s issue into this month’s. Great idea and all, but it’s a pointless few seconds that could have been replaced with anything. It’s like the anime is reminding you that it’s in the future.The main futuristic tech you’ll see in this show are the hardsuits the girls wear (essentially power armor) and the boomers. Otherwise, it’s a pretty weak, pseudo-cyberpunk world. I use pseudo because it doesn’t have a lot of the trappings of the genre aside from robots and that main idea that permeates nearly every piece of cyberpunk fiction: “What is human?”.Otherwise, the computer technology is archaic and outdated even now (yes, I can forgive a series from the late 90’s from not having a grasp on future tech) and about the only thing that the series brings to the table as far as science goes is the idea of bio-technology. The boomers can attach to other metal surfaces and interface with other technology through bonding. They can also change forms and develop mental links with human beings.All this research came from Dr. Stingray, father of Sylia, one of the main characters. He was a dick and did all kinds of awful research on his own family, creating a sentient boomer that could destroy the entire world after interfacing every boomer into a single hive-mind. And that’s where the plot really starts.Get past the first six or so episodes of getting you integrated into this world and the plot isn’t bad at all. It contains a lot of generic ideas but it comes across as entertaining, especially with the case of girls we spend our time with.Linna is a fish out of water goody-goody and probable lesbian. While the series focuses a lot on her at the beginning, it starts to focus more on the interesting characters later on. Priss is a nineties biker-girl/punk rocker who hates the police and treats everyone like garbage…because punk never dies or something. Then there’s my favorite character, Nene, who works for the AD Police as a communications expert and acts like a child despite being an eighteen year old tech genius.Sylia is the one behind the Knight Sabers and is another pretty thin character. She’s the dominant leader type who hides all kinds of secrets that dictate her entire personality. And that’s about all you need to know about her.Later on in the series there are a few romantic threads, one that is pursued to a somewhat satisfying conclusion and the other just there because the plot needs a reason to throw in existential questions about the meaning of life.Despite all that, I thought the characters were an entertaining group that elicited a chuckle or a grin as well as made me have feelings toward the outcome. They’re not as three dimensional as they could be, but they’re still good company.I especially enjoyed Leon, a police officer who is trying to get with Priss. There’s something about the girl who hates cops making out with a cop that makes me blush. Then again, it shows character development as well which isn’t prevalent in many of the characters, another failing of the show. By the end, Priss is actually the most well developed, if only because I feel the writers wanted you to see Priss as the babe of the show. Nene gets a lot of attention but nowhere is she shown to be a badass, she’s more like a whiny nerd and doesn’t grow beyond that. And Linna is just too generic to be entertaining (same with Sylia). So by the end, I guess Priss is the only well-rounded character.Also by the end you’ll find the series has a problem. It sets up some villains at the beginning, gets rid of them, then replaces them with a plain-jane creature with little personality. While the ending is certainly large-scale and epic, it also has very little emotional impact. The person who should be killing the villain and showing emotion sits it out and leaves the other three to engage in the arbitrary final boss fight that…isn’t that exciting.So after a lackluster finale, you’d expect at least an epilogue that wraps everything up but instead we’re given one of the worst endings I’ve seen in a long time.The next paragraph is nothing but spoilers.Instead of showing everyone get back together, Tokyo getting rebuilt, Nene finding a job, and Leon getting some from Priss, we’re given an ending that I think means Nene, Linna, and Priss are dead. So they return to Earth, Linna and Nene stuck on a tropical island (and naked) and Priss stranded in a desert (and naked) and…that’s it. No rescue? No reunions? I’m given to think they all died naked. Even a single lines of Sylia saying “I wonder if we can find the girls” would have been nice. But instead, I’m assuming she figured them to have died.The animation is pretty good for the time, though there are a lot of lower-quality scenes sprinkled throughout (and some especially fucked up faces as well). As far as music is concerned, the opening and endings are okay while the music in the show is the same three tracks over and over. Not much to talk about here.The terrible ending and poor world development aside, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 is very entertaining, has a few memorable characters, and brings up some classic tropes of the genre (though doesn’t explore them enough to really matter to the whole product). It’s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it’s a simple science fiction/action story with a couple badass female characters and just enough intelligence not to have me leave saying “all girl Power Rangers meets Psycho-Pass/Ghost in the Shell”. Instead, the show can stand on its own as a nice, easy introduction into cyberpunk anime. After watching this, you can move into the heavy stuff. Or, if you aren’t too big into the heavy handed philosophy and science of the aforementioned series (Psycho-Pass and GiTS), then you’ll still find something to enjoy in Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040. a businesswoman in Tokyo. Almost immediately she drops a hamburger when a rude motorcyclist drives by and rather than let it go, she chases down the motorcycle like a nutcase. Eventually she meets up with the motorcyclist, Priss, who belongs to a Power Ranger-esque group known as the Knight Sabers. Linna ends up joining them in their fight against rampaging boomers (the anime’s name for robots).For me, the anime starts pretty slow and formulaic, introducing a diverse foursome while also opening up the world. Typically this works but I found the world to be pretty generic and only contain a few sci-fi ideas sprinkled throughout to justify the main plot. At one point Linna plugs a magazine into a machine which turns last month’s issue into this month’s. Great idea and all, but it’s a pointless few seconds that could have been replaced with anything. It’s like the anime is reminding you that it’s in the future.The main futuristic tech you’ll see in this show are the hardsuits the girls wear (essentially power armor) and the boomers. Otherwise, it’s a pretty weak, pseudo-cyberpunk world. I use pseudo because it doesn’t have a lot of the trappings of the genre aside from robots and that main idea that permeates nearly every piece of cyberpunk fiction: “What is human?”.Otherwise, the computer technology is archaic and outdated even now (yes, I can forgive a series from the late 90’s from not having a grasp on future tech) and about the only thing that the series brings to the table as far as science goes is the idea of bio-technology. The boomers can attach to other metal surfaces and interface with other technology through bonding. They can also change forms and develop mental links with human beings.All this research came from Dr. Stingray, father of Sylia, one of the main characters. He was a dick and did all kinds of awful research on his own family, creating a sentient boomer that could destroy the entire world after interfacing every boomer into a single hive-mind. And that’s where the plot really starts.Get past the first six or so episodes of getting you integrated into this world and the plot isn’t bad at all. It contains a lot of generic ideas but it comes across as entertaining, especially with the case of girls we spend our time with.Linna is a fish out of water goody-goody and probable lesbian. While the series focuses a lot on her at the beginning, it starts to focus more on the interesting characters later on. Priss is a nineties biker-girl/punk rocker who hates the police and treats everyone like garbage…because punk never dies or something. Then there’s my favorite character, Nene, who works for the AD Police as a communications expert and acts like a child despite being an eighteen year old tech genius.Sylia is the one behind the Knight Sabers and is another pretty thin character.

It was great up until the last arc.But there was some issues with the villain Mason. This guy was introduced as a mysterious string-puller but the show rarely explored his character enough. We had no info about him except he was a manager of genom (The company making boomers) and Mason's boss he died too easily and wasn't explained either.When a show starts killing villains easily left and right you know it's going down the drain.In the last episodes for some reason show included humor like...gag faces and other stupid effects. Why would you do that? I cannot fathom the thought process of writers. It was distinctly annoying.Also Sylia's father's character was never developed.And finally the elephant in the room GalateaMy biggest problem with this show. Her phenomenon and her motivations were rarely explained and Project Umbrella was rarely explained too. The show tried to explain these two things in the last two episodes obviously it didn't work.Galatea killed Mason which distinctly pissed me off. How can he die remarkably easily?And last but not least when Galatea killed by Priss. Nuclear irradiation or something like that entered everthing on earth and that was Galatea? I cannot take this seriously anymore.I've never seen something this ridiculous in my life.Honestly I should've stopped watching this when Galatea fused with tower.In the end the series failed to develop the villain which genuinely pissed me off. The climax sucked ass. This anime was waste of my time. Stay away from it. gag faces and other stupid effects. Why would you do that? I cannot fathom the thought process of writers.

This is my first review on MAL and I\'m not necessarily sure this is the best show to start it off with. Regardless, it is the one I have finished most recently so giving it a review while it is fresh in my mind seems to be fair.There are a few aspects of the show that are severely lacking, and a couple strong points that might compel someone to finish all 26 episodes. On the strong side, the characters are well realized and often more engaging than you would find in the original series (never mind the dumpster fire that is Crash); Linna...serving as the vehicle to introduce you to the rest of the main cast by giving her this \'fresh off the boat\' perspective is welcome, and Priss has at least a marginal amount more depth than she did in other versions of the series. Likewise, Sylia and Nene are also interesting and add valued contrast to the rest of the crew, and Sylia specifically has enough clouded history to help drive the plot forward. I miss the fact that Mackie isn\'t trying to bang his sister, however...Though being a musician is core to Priss\' character, I can\'t help but shake the feeling that the showrunners watched the ""Hurricane"" intro of the original OVA over and over again and tried to recapture that same magic. The Japanese VA for Priss in this series isn\'t even as half as good a singer as the original VA, and though that fact doesn\'t detract from her normal dialogue, it can\'t help but feel like a pale imitation of the original every time she sings.The art is also a higher point of the show, the hardsuits are all decent designs and the setting is often well drawn though the animation is frequently \'quality\' (not a good thing) in the way that late 90\'s shows often are. Some of the boomer art is also pretty decent, though many are worse than the original OVA, likewise the vehicles such as the Motoslave look somewhat worse than they did previously, but that is neither here nor there.What is wrong with the show is the story, there is no villain and characters you\'d think would serve a major role in the series turn into absolute non entities and seem to exist solely to bring about the half-baked final villain. It turns the 16 episodes you invested in before the final villain is revealed into a genuine waste where scarce little is related between the two.If you\'re a fan of the series and need another dose after watching the original OVA it\'ll satisfy that desire, though the ambiguous ending still leaves you wanting more.

But if you\'re looking for a worldbeater this isn\'t it.', 'The entire Bubblegum Crisis world (both this and the original) is similar to Serial Experiment Lain. The creators/writers didn\'t really understand technology. IMO both series were written by people who were scared of the way the world was developing or saw that the members of the general populace were. In this world the creator didn\'t really understand the concept of androids or bio technology. They essentially merged a bunch of futuristic idea\'s that were scary to create something called Boomers. Then created a female power rangers group to fight them. I know at the time this series was made it was popular to create these...types of fighting groups (although they were usually male + maybe 1 token female).I still recommend this series mostly because shows with strong female leads, no ""fan service"" (thank god), and the fact the bubblegum crisis world is part of Japanese cyberpunk history.p.s. I think this series is better than the original bubblegum crisis (at least story wise) types of fighting groups (although they were usually male + maybe 1 token female).I still recommend this series mostly because shows with strong female leads, no ""fan service"" (thank god), and the fact the bubblegum crisis world is part of Japanese cyberpunk history.p.s. I think this series is better than the original bubblegum crisis (at least story wise)', ""Maybe this is a bad idea. Writing this review, I mean. I've already made it clear that I think Bubblegum Crisis 2032, the late 80's OVA, is my favorite goddamn media product and has been for the past six years or so, right? Of course I'm going to be disappointed in any reboot that tries to not only do different things than the OVA, but does so on what's clearly a fraction of the budget. Why should you listen to me? Ah, but who am I kidding, when was the last time bias or decorum stopped someone on the internet?Fuck this. It's time for a...reckoning. I was hurt by this anime. It's time to hurt the fuck back.Bubblegum Crisis 2040 is the only anime I have watched tip-to-tail that I didn't just find bad in a way that I could laugh or scratch my head at. This anime made me angry, truly, terribly angry, a rising anger that bubbled up the second the show used a shitty repeating frame cycle for a backflip as early as episode two, then reused it for episode three. It doesn't just shit on the promise of its premise, it heaves out its own innards, every liter of black bilious blood and square inch of rancid green intestines, on what made Crisis good in the first place in exchange for chasing the hype of being an evangelion clone, with all the psychodrama and Deep and Flawed characters that entails. It is the kind of anime where the final building block in the romance between one of its heroines and the cop who's been chasing after her is when he saves her from attacking animated clown dolls, and thinks that this is it, this is how a woman falls for a man, when they're saved from FUCKING CHEAP-ASS CLOWN DOLLS...Whew. Okay. Attempt Number Two. Let's break it down by different parts of the show, as one used to do on this site. Maybe that will stifle my rage a little.Story: Spends one cour on robot-monster-of-the-week stories, with the actual plot seeming to build at something of a slow burn, until the real antagonist pair comes to the fore and this ostensibly cyberpunk-ish story becomes a rote robot-zombie apocalypse. The first cour has almost no bearing on the second cour's plot, you could cut so much cruft from that first half and focus more on the actual villain(s) of the show, but 2040 has no sense of its own narrative priorities. Almost every major story that advances the plot will be streeeeched out over two episodes when it's clear there's no need to do so, leaving us on annoying rug-pull cliffhangers everytime without a sense of satisfaction that anything has been resolved as the plot chugs along.It's also thematically muddled as hell. One gets the sense, multiple times, that the show is trying to Say Something about the Boomer robots and their place alongside humanity, but ultimately none of it makes any sense, especially since Boomers themselves possess bullshit matter-morphing powers that turn them into Resident Evil monsters that are then the zombie-pawns of the Big Bad who wants to destroy humanity for reasons that change on a dime, reasons that even when they're being exposited in the penultimate episode make no goddamn sense. Why is this whole plot happening? What is the point? Why can't the Sabers ever be allowed to stop the robot apocalypse, or at least slow it down, only for plot-convenience to hinder them at crucial moments because the writers can't let anything be resolved, any victory that the Sabers have any agency over occur? No, seriously, the Big Bad fuses with one of the characters, decides She's God Now, and then fucks off into another dimension in the course of five minutes. What was the point, 2040? What was the fucking point? Oh, wait, there was none, you just wanted to sound Deeeeeep without having a cursory understanding of your own ideas. Which... wasn't that the promise of 2040? That it was supposed to have a deeper, more put-together story than its more fragmented predecessor? Oh boy is that not the case.Characters: Infuriating. For all the insistence that 2040 is a more feminist show than 2032, 2040 seems far more willing to snatch away narrative agency from its characters, _especially_ Sylia Stingray. Jesus, I could write an entire essay on the character assassination she undergoes. Suffice to say that the cool-headed leader has been replaced with an alcoholic hysteric damsel with Other M-level daddy issues, who attempts to plan her war against the villains but is pathetically outplayed every goddamn time she tries to do something that might be cool. I felt bad for her in a metanarrative sense, because the writers clearly thought that making her a less competent Misato Katsuragi was somehow creating a Deep Character.The rest of the characters aren't done much better. Linna Yamazaki goes from a money-crazed yuppie in 2032 with a big heart -- which is cliché but at least it's something -- to a total blank slate. She acts as the audience surrogate for the first few arcs -- because apparently we needed this show's premise fucking spoonfed to us over the course of four or five episodes -- before being seemingly forgotten entirely as a character besides one episode where she goes home to the country and then comes back to save the day. Priss Asagiri, the gal who snatches the protagonist spotlight from her, goes from hotheaded and loud and scene-stealing in 2032 to sullen and silent and honestly kind of boring. The only Saber who doesn't get character-destroyed is Nene Romanova, and that's mostly based on the fact that she was the token moe character in 2032 and needed a plot-power glow-up, not staying about the same as her old self. As it is, the only ways they can make her useful in 2040 are points where she... rewires an electrical grid to stop a monster-of-the-week? You would think a hacker would be cooler in this show, but nope, no, nyet, sorry, go fuck yourself viewer.And the antagonists! They were right to kill Mason off in the first few episodes of 2032, his position in any narrative is inherently kind of boring, so 2040 keeping Mason around is... well, it makes sense, but like everything else about this show it doesn't fucking work. Jouji Nakata goes a great job voicing the bad guy, bless him, but Mason seems to never be hindered by anything right up until the last act where the REAL Big Bad shows up and fucks around with him, so there's no sense of him being anything other than a plot device. Oh God, and his motivation! Big Bad Galatea just *explains* it in one exposition dump, and it's a motivation, yes, but it's the most angsty, stupid motivation I've seen in anime! And what're Galatea's ultimate motivations for unleashing robopocalypse? Like I said, even when it was explained to me point-blank I began understanding it as 'Boomers have surpassed humanity', which we've all seen before haven't we, and eventually ended screaming 'THAT'S NOT HOW EVOLUTION WORKS YOU DIPSHITS!' at my computer. We've all been there, haven't we? No? Good, I hope not.Art & Animation: You know, you can say a lot of disparaging things about Bubblegum Crisis's story, say that it's undercooked, throws you in at the deep end and expects you to swim, but at least it looks really fucking cool while doing it, leveraging all the money of the bubble economy to deliver brilliant cityscapes, fast-paced fight scenes, and wonderfully articulated mecha and character designs. It's really 80's, but definitely in a way that's aged well. 2040? Like I said, they resorted to tawdry animation loops in the middle of ostensibly high-budget fight as early as episode 2. Not a good sign, right? Well, yeah. Every part of Megatokyo looks cheapened, plasticized, from the hardsuits to the vehicles to the backgrounds to the Boomers. Oh God, the Boomers are just fucking awful. I don't know what possessed the designers to crib from the weird matter-absorption powers that Boomers had in 2032 for only one goddamn episode -- oh, no, wait, I do, budget concerns. This way Boomers can just attack by shooting tentacles at our heroines, our heroines can fail to adequately damage a Boomer in any fight, they can do some bondage stuff for a bit, and then some x-factor finishes the fight in a way that doesn't feel earned. Like, ever.Again, it's baffling, because 2032's fight scenes are excellent, big and explosive and fast-paced in a way nothing in sluggish 2040 is. Could they just not get the money to make it work? Had BGC's star as a franchise faded so fast that they just couldn't get the money? I wonder. Certainly the turn of the millennium was not a time for big-budget franchises. But all the same, I can't forgive that the primary medium of action and motion in this anime is tentacles.Music: 2032 had some of the most iconic 80's J-rock this side of Macross. I don't say that lightly: Konya Wa Hurricane, Mad Machine, Say Yes... all these sung tracks all hold up to this day. They feel big, loud, and cool, which is the point: Crisis was meant to sell music as much as it was meant to sell itself.Now, I could forgive 2040 for not going for that golden standard, it was always trying to do something different, but the music we actually get in its stead is... yeesh. It's bad. It's droning, pulsing, techno every time, techno that never feels like it syncs well with the action that's going on but instead just exists because they needed an action track. I don't have much to say here, just that losing such a crucial part of the original 2032 experience feels so disappointing.Overall: Goethe once said that criticism of a work should focus on three things: What is a work trying to do, does it succeed, and was it worth doing. Bubblegum Crisis 2040 wants next to nothing to do with the old Crisis, and maybe it knows what it wants to do in its stead, which is try to make a cyberpunk Evangelion with all the Depth and Darkness that implies.Does it succeed? Fuck no. It would need a far more liberal budget to spend on actually interesting action scenes, it would need to give us interesting and competent characters, it would need to know what it wanted to say before it went and said it.Was it worth doing? Maybe. Stand Alone Complex remains iconic for those who've seen it because of its excellent sense of itself and what it's trying to do, but that's not really cyberpunk Evangelion, and it isn't really Bubblegum Crisis either. But the sheer magnitude of Crisis's failure to deliver an exciting or interesting cyberpunk-superhero-action story, its almost willful need to suck, will remain in my mind for a long time, as something I can consider with ease whenever I want to feel rage, and then despair.Don't watch this fucking anime, folks. You won't come out of it happier, or wiser. reckoning. I was hurt by this anime. It's time to hurt the fuck back.Bubblegum Crisis 2040 is the only anime I have watched tip-to-tail that I didn't just find bad in a way that I could laugh or scratch my head at.

You would think a hacker would be cooler in this show, but nope, no, nyet, sorry, go fuck yourself viewer.And the antagonists! They were right to kill Mason off in the first few episodes of 2032, his position in any narrative is inherently kind of boring, so 2040 keeping Mason around is... well, it makes sense, but like everything else about this show it doesn't fucking work. Jouji Nakata goes a great job voicing the bad guy, bless him, but Mason seems to never be hindered by anything right up until the last act where the REAL Big Bad shows up and fucks around with him, so there's no sense of him being anything other than a plot device. Oh God, and his motivation! Big Bad Galatea just *explains* it in one exposition dump, and it's a motivation, yes, but it's the most angsty, stupid motivation I've seen in anime! And what're Galatea's ultimate motivations for unleashing robopocalypse? Like I said, even when it was explained to me point-blank I began understanding it as 'Boomers have surpassed humanity', which we've all seen before haven't we, and eventually ended screaming 'THAT'S NOT HOW EVOLUTION WORKS YOU DIPSHITS!' at my computer. We've all been there, haven't we? No? Good, I hope not.Art & Animation: You know, you can say a lot of disparaging things about Bubblegum Crisis's story, say that it's undercooked, throws you in at the deep end and expects you to swim, but at least it looks really fucking cool while doing it, leveraging all the money of the bubble economy to deliver brilliant cityscapes, fast-paced fight scenes, and wonderfully articulated mecha and character designs. It's really 80's, but definitely in a way that's aged well. 2040? Like I said, they resorted to tawdry animation loops in the middle of ostensibly high-budget fight as early as episode 2. Not a good sign, right? Well, yeah. Every part of Megatokyo looks cheapened, plasticized, from the hardsuits to the vehicles to the backgrounds to the Boomers. Oh God, the Boomers are just fucking awful. I don't know what possessed the designers to crib from the weird matter-absorption powers that Boomers had in 2032 for only one goddamn episode -- oh, no, wait, I do, budget concerns. This way Boomers can just attack by shooting tentacles at our heroines, our heroines can fail to adequately damage a Boomer in any fight, they can do some bondage stuff for a bit, and then some x-factor finishes the fight in a way that doesn't feel earned. Like, ever.Again, it's baffling, because 2032's fight scenes are excellent, big and explosive and fast-paced in a way nothing in sluggish 2040 is. Could they just not get the money to make it work? Had BGC's star as a franchise faded so fast that they just couldn't get the money? I wonder. Certainly the turn of the millennium was not a time for big-budget franchises. But all the same, I can't forgive that the primary medium of action and motion in this anime is tentacles.Music: 2032 had some of the most iconic 80's J-rock this side of Macross. I don't say that lightly: Konya Wa Hurricane, Mad Machine, Say Yes... all these sung tracks all hold up to this day. They feel big, loud, and cool, which is the point: Crisis was meant to sell music as much as it was meant to sell itself.Now, I could forgive 2040 for not going for that golden standard, it was always trying to do something different, but the music we actually get in its stead is... yeesh. It's bad. It's droning, pulsing, techno every time, techno that never feels like it syncs well with the action that's going on but instead just exists because they needed an action track. I don't have much to say here, just that losing such a crucial part of the original 2032 experience feels so disappointing.Overall: Goethe once said that criticism of a work should focus on three things: What is a work trying to do, does it succeed, and was it worth doing. Bubblegum Crisis 2040 wants next to nothing to do with the old Crisis, and maybe it knows what it wants to do in its stead, which is try to make a cyberpunk Evangelion with all the Depth and Darkness that implies.Does it succeed? Fuck no. It would need a far more liberal budget to spend on actually interesting action scenes, it would need to give us interesting and competent characters, it would need to know what it wanted to say before it went and said it.Was it worth doing? Maybe. Stand Alone Complex remains iconic for those who've seen it because of its excellent sense of itself and what it's trying to do, but that's not really cyberpunk Evangelion, and it isn't really Bubblegum Crisis either. But the sheer magnitude of Crisis's failure to deliver an exciting or interesting cyberpunk-superhero-action story, its almost willful need to suck, will remain in my mind for a long time, as something I can consider with ease whenever I want to feel rage, and then despair.Don't watch this fucking anime, folks. You won't come out of it happier, or wiser.""]"
Boku no Chikyuu wo Mamotte,https://myanimelist.net/anime/526/Boku_no_Chikyuu_wo_Mamotte,"[""Please Save My Earth is a very gentle yet tragic exploration of the power of destiny and personal struggle. While there is some outstanding action scenes towards the end of the 6 episode OAV, the series revolves around the development and destruction of the main characters. The plot itself is intermingled with a metaphysical look at the deceptive appearance of innocence and the desperate and destructive poison of love. While some may find the plot slow-moving, to others (more accustomed to shoujo anime) the story is very intense and involves very tragic and touching descriptions of personal dreams and even pride.Throughout the series there is...an environmental sub-theme.  I find myself wishing that the anime creators had included more of this element, as there was lots of content to support a more Arjuna-esc tale. However, the romantic revelations in PSME are enough to carry the series through to Excellence.The music by Hajime Mizoguchi and Yoko Kanno is outstanding, though it may not appeal to all viewers. I think it was a perfect mix of sci-fi and primitive sounds. Akino Arai's Prologue: Time of Gold Flowing is a beautiful track and has a very tragic tone to it.Please Save My Earth has the most hateable and lovable characters. If you cannot get wrapped up in this teenage romantic fantasy then perhaps a closer evaluation of your previous lives is necessary. This touching journey makes my top 10 anime without a doubt as the series took me on a journey of classical and unrivaled romantic fantasy. an environmental sub-theme.

When I took them home, I watched and most of them weren't too good - until I watched Please Save My Earth. It blew me away in a way that I haven't been since I first discovered subtitled anime.  I cannot believe that something that good happened to be in a bargain bin.Story: The basic premise of PSME is the tragedy of seven reincarnated researchers.   Originally members of a scientifically...advanced civilization, they were tasked to observe the earth from a base on the moon.  The specific focus of the plot is how the characters interact once the tragic events which lead to their deaths come to light.  A very compelling plot follows, combining elements of classical tragedy and science fiction.  I would note, however, the OVA doesn't end with a climax so much as with a somewhat vague outro.  This is generally one of two things: a hasty way to wrap thing up, and a contribution to the atmosphere of the show.  Personally, I don't see the story marred much by the lack of a &quot;proper&quot; ending.Art: Detailed, but nothing really special, given the age it was drawn in.  The only notable feature is that the visuals manage to be dark without being intense.  Even when the scene is tragic, it has a mellow yet urgent feel to it.Sound: The ending to this show, &quot;Toki no Kioku&quot;, is, quite literally, my #1 song in all of anime.  (Beating out Forever Young, Yuuzora no Kamihouki, and Love a Riddle)  It's about 3 minutes long, and it could be a lullaby, dirge, or ballad, depending on your mood.  It really encapsulates both the tragic and mellow components of the show.  THe soundtrack itself is the same way, a mix of easy listening and orchestral which really puts the plot away.Character: The seven scientists are well developed, and, the more you see, the deeper the bonds between them draw you in.  Each character has complex emotions which play a clear role in their motives, and their visual designs fit their moods so well it's almost scary.Enjoyment: This show made me cry, and it's one of two anime that has ever actually done that.  It's sad enough to be believable, but not so sad that I can't relate.  I watched it for the full three hours without even taking a bathroom break.Overall: The presentation was artful, the sound fantastical, and it's short enough to fit into an afternoon.

Like many other series from the 1990s, the atmosphere is there, but the series is glued together by some very good scenes, followed by monotonous drama. Despite my criticism, I think Please Save My Earth is worth watching.

There\'s nothing separating this anime style from most of the others in the 90s. The sound was sub-standard. The voice mics seemed regular, but the some sound effects were missing in ""lesser"" scenes and some of the sounds effects were lackluster in more ""epic"" scenes.The story is terribly boring. With a title like ""Please Save My Earth"" and knowing it was about people being reincarnated I originally thought there was a threat that killed the last people, and they were purposefully reincarnated to address the threat. It turns it that...it\'s a very unnecessarily tragic-weird slice of life anime. There\'s no threat outside of the self/ destructiveness of the main characters. And then, for all they went through emotionally they ended up not doing anything.The characters are carbon copies of ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" with  past life retrospectives. Everyone does hardly anything and no one gets what they want, in the end. Really, everyone is worse off than when they started, but it\'s so inconsequentially because most of them didn\'t do anything. What\'s really boring is that there\'s 7 characters and they only went into the life of one of them. One of the characters that did something stop doing it and is suddenly redeemable characters for no connected reason. The other character that did something really didn\'t do much of anything until the very end, and it now regretting his new life for what he did in his previous one.The character that got a lot of camera time at the start is very weak character that fades in and out until the end, and doesn\'t have much value. The person that character was before has more value than the present day character. However, because this person didn\'t engage with past life stuff as much as the others, she\'s the only one that has more screen time that\'s the least tragic. There are the 2 tragic gay guys, because one of the women came back as a man. The other 2 characters are cheerful and normal mooded teenagers, so they\'re not important.It\'s an anime about people that choose to be traumatized by things they didn\'t do. They live on Earth as normal people (more or less) and they don\'t do much of anything that anyone cares about.

Personally, I didn’t expect anything special when I read the summary. Since it had 6 episodes I decided to watch it because I have another anime more that I watched.The story is initially about Alice Sakaguchi who, due to a misunderstanding, accidentally finds out that her classmates Jinpachi and Issei constantly have common dreams that are recurring dreams about a group of lunar-based scientists observing the Earth....When Alice has one of the ""moon dreams"", she will try to find other scientists together with Jinpachi and Issei because they are all reincarnations of those scientists who died of a mysterious disease on the moon. While that idea of theirs sounds great, things will get a little complicated. Namely, a character who is also one of the reincarnated scientists will hide his identity and negatively influence some events in his favor. That character is also a villain and he will manage to fool everyone. Supernatural powers will help him realize his plans. The powers of this character are so strong that even some people who have the same powers cannot defeat him so easily. Towards the end, we will find out the story of his past life, which is so tragic.Another problem that will be created is that the characters can’t cope with what happened in their past. They will begin to mix their present and past lives. There will be jealousy and revenge. Let’s just say it’s their personal struggle.All in all, this anime is about the characters and how they will interact after the events that led to their deaths come to light. The story is very intense and includes very tragic and touching events. This anime also has very interesting characters. What I liked most about this anime was that it was so interesting that I watched it without a break.

Please Save My Earth does not have an ending. The final scene in the 6th episode is a sneak peak of compilation of events that happen in the manga. Basically, Please Save My Earth has a ""go read the manga"" ending.Despite such a lackluster ending, you must be wondering why still a 10/10 review? Because this series is a phenomenal piece of work. It an outstanding performance of animation, music and story, and a true testament to what anime in the 90\'s really was.Any avid watcher of anime should have...experienced the severe redundancy that has plagued anime since the 2000s. Every popular anime has the same tropes, the same melodrama, that same structure, and the same narrative technique. You can talk about how music, story, animation and characters are essential but the truth is there is an abundance of anime that has nailed all those 4 things but are missing a massive element to what makes an anime .. good. Pacing.When anime is an extremely oversaturated medium with thousands of pieces fighting for your attention, what separates a good story from another equally good story? The answer is pacing. And that is what Please Save My Earth excels at most. The pacing is phenomenal. It grabs you, forces you to provide attention, steers your emotions towards something you didn\'t expect to feel. Because of it\'s excellent pacing, it subverts your every assumption of what the show is. The anime is riddled with incredible plot twists, but it isn\'t just the story elements that make the twists grab at you. It\'s the way the chain of events is executed in that makes the twists incredible. Even if you have watched innumerable anime and are immune to any attempt of surprise, the anime doesn\'t care, it will hook you. If not by the story elements, then the technique of presenting the story elements.As for more on the ""go read the manga ending"", that isn\'t a rare phenomenon when it comes to anime. A good chunk of anime, including some of the most titular titles are plagued with this same curse. So while I debated to give this series a 9/10 for the ending alone, in the end I felt the docking a score of 1 undeserved.To respect the nature of this being a spoiler free review, I won\'t go much into characters or plot. The music however, deserves nothing less than mountains of praise. Yoko Kanno\'s most phenomenal work. The music compliments the tone of the story perfectly. Please save my earth has themes of faith, religious turmoil, hopelessness of fate and feelings of misanthropy. Polar opposite themes, but the music highlights those opposites by evoking in you feelings of spirituality and transcendence. Close your eyes, sit in a quiet room, and listen to ""Prologue: Time Of Gold Flowing"" with headphones on. You will feel like a incorporeal ecclesiastic traversing through space and time, your soul stretched between reality and the realm of divinity. Please save my earth aspires to make you feel like a 4th dimensional entity viewing the timelines of humans in the dimension below you. You feel the despair of being unable to give the characters the prescience you have, but also feeling of peace for the characters, because of your knowledge of the transcendental energy making provision for them. For a series to make a viewer feel so omniscient yet so vulnerable, what can you give it besides a 10. experienced the severe redundancy that has plagued anime since the 2000s.

Pacing.When anime is an extremely oversaturated medium with thousands of pieces fighting for your attention, what separates a good story from another equally good story? The answer is pacing. And that is what Please Save My Earth excels at most. The pacing is phenomenal. It grabs you, forces you to provide attention, steers your emotions towards something you didn\'t expect to feel. Because of it\'s excellent pacing, it subverts your every assumption of what the show is. The anime is riddled with incredible plot twists, but it isn\'t just the story elements that make the twists grab at you. It\'s the way the chain of events is executed in that makes the twists incredible. Even if you have watched innumerable anime and are immune to any attempt of surprise, the anime doesn\'t care, it will hook you. If not by the story elements, then the technique of presenting the story elements.As for more on the ""go read the manga ending"", that isn\'t a rare phenomenon when it comes to anime. A good chunk of anime, including some of the most titular titles are plagued with this same curse. So while I debated to give this series a 9/10 for the ending alone, in the end I felt the docking a score of 1 undeserved.To respect the nature of this being a spoiler free review, I won\'t go much into characters or plot. The music however, deserves nothing less than mountains of praise. Yoko Kanno\'s most phenomenal work. The music compliments the tone of the story perfectly. Please save my earth has themes of faith, religious turmoil, hopelessness of fate and feelings of misanthropy. Polar opposite themes, but the music highlights those opposites by evoking in you feelings of spirituality and transcendence. Close your eyes, sit in a quiet room, and listen to ""Prologue: Time Of Gold Flowing"" with headphones on. You will feel like a incorporeal ecclesiastic traversing through space and time, your soul stretched between reality and the realm of divinity. Please save my earth aspires to make you feel like a 4th dimensional entity viewing the timelines of humans in the dimension below you. You feel the despair of being unable to give the characters the prescience you have, but also feeling of peace for the characters, because of your knowledge of the transcendental energy making provision for them. For a series to make a viewer feel so omniscient yet so vulnerable, what can you give it besides a 10.', ""Initially I was looking for reference poses to draw, for some reason I found pictures of 2 characters from this anime, namely Issei and Shusuran. At first I thought this was an ordinary old anime with a story that wasn't good, but it turns out that after episode 2 the story got even more interesting. The characters' personalities are very unique, making me curious about their respective stories in their previous lives. Actually the story is quite predictable, but if we just watch the anime we don't know what ending Shion will achieve in Rin's body at the moment.If only this anime could be...re-adapted with today's animation technology, I would really watch it with my friends hahahaReally a recommendation to watch, even though it's only 6 episodes and I really want to read the comic hahaha re-adapted with today's animation technology, I would really watch it with my friends hahahaReally a recommendation to watch, even though it's only 6 episodes and I really want to read the comic hahaha""]"

This comes off as quite confusing because it tries to tell you what was going on during certain parts of the main story while trying to be separate at the same time.It just kept switching to different parts to explain things, but at that point? I didn't care because the story was so far along in the main series that it shouldn't matter anymore unless you really think it was plotholes.That's what...this anime seems like a plothole anime.

Remember that the anime has 23 official episodes, not 24, so in case you're watching your fair share of 24 episodes of “Black Cat”, you will have to note that the 15th episode would be this one.The change in storytelling they had in this episode, linking parallel events as they progress surprisingly worked really good here....You can tell that the purpose was to justify a number of plot points a clear out many mysterious relationships between several characters, which the spotlights being on Train and Sephiria giving us glimpse of how they both met, and what kind of person each one of them sees the other.In the context of the story, it didn't do any great deeds really, but it was nice seeing more of Train's past, how he completed his first mission and how he transformed to the ice cold killer we all have come to know.

Looking at the art style and quickly finding out it\'s school story about small children, and that it didn\'t heavily feature crudeness or violence, I thought for sure that I would be bored out of my mind.I was wrong.I watched this movie during my breaks at work and was thoroughly engrossed in everything Maruko set out to do. I recalled my own hope and desire to do really well at simple things at school and failing at them miserably. It made me remember the friendships that I had.The ""flatness"" of some...of the characters\' personality was acceptable because, as a kid, I only really made the effort to know a few people really well. It made their portrayal more believable. The flamboyant one, the ugly clown, the suck-up, the orderly teacher wannabe.The movie did a great job of reminding me that childhood may seem easier as an adult, but for the kids living it it\'s just as serious and important to them that their lives go well. The ending isn\'t tragic in the usual sense, and though it is predictable it is very well set up and it was hard to avoid feeling for everyone involved.I\'d recommend this movie to anyone who looks back on childhood with a little bit of longing.

Cobra The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5032/Cobra_The_Animation,"['Cobra is a show that is very much out of place in today\'s world. It is a pulp sci-fi action comedy that is ripped directly from the 1980s, and is a fantastic throwback to the days when anime was fun, over-the-top and testosterone-fueled. Gun arms, impossibly proportioned women, and comedic one-liners.If you sat down to Cobra for the story, you would be sadly disappointed. As with most shows that could be described as pulpy, the plot is more a way to give Cobra things to do to be a badass. It does that well, and that is really all the show asks. There are a...few story arcs, the longest lasting four episodes, and several one-shots. They\'re entertaining enough, but hardly memorable.The animation is fairly good. There\'s no glaring animation errors, and the entire production has a low-budget, old school feel to it that lends a lot of flavor to the show. The CG is (intentionally?) fairly poor, but is perfectly suited to the throwback style that the show is trying to cultivate.All in all, Cobra will a bit of a hard sell to most anime fans, looking for the next androgynous pretty-boy protagonist. However, if you yearn for the days where men were men, women were ""dames,"" and arms were guns, against a backdrop of cool jazz... well, I think I have a show for you. few story arcs, the longest lasting four episodes, and several one-shots.

If you don\'t like cheesy old-school or satire, you\'re really not going to like this series at all, I\'ll give you that as a fair warning.First, you\'ve got the typical daredevil macho hero with...an arm that looks like it belongs on Megaman, then there\'s the scantily clad heroine and the villain I can almost imagine yelling ""I\'ll get you next time, Gadget!"" as she flies away in her ship after having her plans foiled. (I want to say again, but this is only the first episode so far)Second, you\'ve got what looks like a pretty typical plot - keep the key to the Universe from the bad guys while you get it to where it needs to be. Nothing fancy at all here.So, why the (somewhat) high rating?Maybe it\'s just that something feels almost nostalgic about this, or maybe it\'s that this type of ""typical"" is actually pretty uncommon in anime. I\'d say the main character almost feels like He-Man with a gun arm, and certainly seems like he\'d belong more in an American-style cartoon rather than an anime.I also appreciated a couple of satirical bits in the first episode: Normally, when the hero blasts away a vehicle as it races towards him, the flaming debris that should remain seems to conveniently vanish. This wasn\'t the case with Cobra, as the flying vehicle speeding towards the hero simply became a flaming flying vehicle speeding towards the hero instead.Given that we\'re only at the first episode right now, I could be wrong and this could turn out to be a terrible series, but so far I\'m leaning towards believing it\'s satire and am enjoying it thoroughly. an arm that looks like it belongs on Megaman, then there\'s the scantily clad heroine and the villain I can almost imagine yelling ""I\'ll get you next time, Gadget!"" as she flies away in her ship after having her plans foiled.

We see Cobra fight in an illegal underground fist fight, battles a gladiator which briefly turns into a DBZ fight, dives under the sea, climbs a mountain which may not exist, explores a planet filled with the most disturbing plants with faces & ends the series with a King's rescue mission.While...the animation looks at his highest it doesn't have that visual flair compared to its movie & 1982 series. In my opinon, the women somehow look at their sexiest in this series. The stories featured here are more tragic especially episodes 8 & 9 as it goes in a much darker route than Cobra usually goes to. Out of all the episodes I'd say the mountain story arc (6&7) is probably the best one in terms of mystery & suspense. As for action, it never really peaks or stays engaging all the way through, it instead has some action highlights in bits & pieces rather than a full episode.Overall, the same fun is found here although 13 episodes feels way too short. I also felt it wasn't as creative when it came to exploring the universe of Cobra(again comparing it to the first anime). Not a bad addition as the episodes are based on certain manga chapters, but the original series still remains the best of the Cobra franchise. the animation looks at his highest it doesn't have that visual flair compared to its movie & 1982 series.

To put it pretty straight forward, it shows the end results of Final Fantasy VII, but this time we view it from the perspective of an ordinary kid named Denzel, who was caught up in it.Story:8/10The whole premise of the storyline takes place in flashback sequences, as told by Denzel, who not only explains just how he got where he is at present, but he also wants to join the WRO. Now don’t get...turned off by the fact that this OVA ends up being a spin-off, because even though the story does not follow the characters you have grown to know and love, it still manages to capture what really counts in the series...Final Fantasy VII’s heart! Denzel is defiantly not a kid who had it easy, as he continues his tale of love and lose, you will get that deep emotion that the series has been so good at making its audience feel, and thus will truly make you feel like you are viewing the Final Fantasy world through the eyes of this kid. Such emotions like anger, sadness, excitement, and maybe even a little bit of laughs are all present here. Which was nice considering that the whole OVA in its entirety was in fact quite serious. The cast from the original video game is few and far between, but you do get some nice cameo appearances from staple characters towards the end, which was nice at bringing the whole FF feel together. That being said of course, if you are unfamiliar with the Final Fantasy VII universe, then this title can be best described as having lite military themes, and all about showing the reality of war and rebuilding. If you’re not into this style of anime, then I doubt this one will make you change your mind on it, plus some fans of the series may in fact be dissapointed that it doesn’t have familiar faces. All in all though, the heart of the series is indeed in tacked, and contains everything that has made the Final Fantasy games so enjoyable with their story. If you’re a fan that doesn’t mind seeing new faces introduced to the story, then you will enjoy this.Art: 8/10The animation is sharp and well detailed, and many fans will recognize environments from the game and movie. Even though I am not the biggest Final Fantasy fan around, and thus don’t keep up with every sort of version that is made, I still found it quite nice to see some of my favorite places now in animated form. I wouldn’t go on par of saying that it’s the most well animated OVA out there, but they did animate it just like you would have pictured it in your head, and for that reason I really enjoyed it.Sound: 7/10Now it could be the fact that I haven’t played the game in some time, but I honestly remember the series sounding much better than this did. The whole time nothing really jumped out at me, with the exception of the ending theme. Background music was appropriate, but nothing really special that will be remembered after viewing it. Voice acting was good, and I think they got the right actors for each role. But they also sounded pretty ordinary, particularly with many of the adult male characters. I feel like I heard their sort of deep voices in many anime before. Still, the sound isn’t shabby by any means, it just doesn’t really have much charm to it overall.Characters: 7/10A good cast considering that most are new to the franchise. Since the story revolves around Denzel for most of the time, he is the one that is most important when it comes to this category. He did a good job at making you belive he wanted to help others, and his caring nature was impressive. However, there were certain parts where I felt the emotion he was trying to bring, either felt a little forced, or was missing in general. Even though the supporting cast was not the most varied, they still acted very human and quite believable. The personalities of the cameo appearances done by the original cast were also quite good, I felt not a moment had past since I had seen them last, even if it was only for a brief moment.Overall: 8/10Despite the fact that the appearance of the original cast is very brief, it ended up being surprisingly very true to the Final Fantasy universe, and I felt all of the emotion that Denzel felt. That, along with the familiar environments, will really involve the viewer. If you’re not a fan of the series, or don’t care for more serious and/or emotional storylines, then this won’t make you change your mind. Plus some fans may also find this OVA a bit too far fetched.

Throw in the rest of the cast and you got a fairly well rounded series that stayed fresh for over 150 episodes. When I was told that there would be a spin off series involving Inuyasha and Kagome’s children I was ecstatic, a chance to finally see what happened to one of my favorite couples years after the end of their story and watch their kids in action. Sadly, yashahime is a trite...and boring mockery of the original series lacking in every distinctive quality that made the original enjoyable. This review will expand on why this is a horrible spin off and why I regret even bothering to have watched it.First of all, the story is absolutely disjointed and irreconcilably poorly written, this isn’t a situation of “things will be explained just keep watching” or “it gets better”, no after watching the anime through 2 seasons it has actually gotten even more disorienting and confusing with little explanation. Motivations for the villains don’t make sense, antagonists change their mind like 15 min into an episode because they had a change of heart that makes no sense, random villains show up with 0 foreshadowing or explanation on why they are even there. The direction of the storyboarding was clearly done by people who had little to no care about writing anything cohesive, I am not sure if the mangaka themselves lost their touch as I have not actually read the source material for this. All I have to say without any major spoilers is that the story literally makes no sense, its incredibly contrived with no motivations for the characters who take part in the story, no logic in terms of power scaling for major battles or creating a sense of tension and horrible pacing where characters throw in whole motivational speeches mid fight.In terms of art, Yashahime is a powerpoint presentation with repetitive combat choreography that involves throwing a few attacks between fights before one of the half demon girls gives a speech and one-shots their opponent with a surprise power up. The amount of terrible backgrounds, horrible in-betweens, and awful jarring camera work screams low budget and a rushed schedule.The Opening is nice for music, otherwise utterly unremarkable soundtrack.The characters involve a bunch of bratty girls who fall into 3 common tropes, the original series characters getting limited screen time and acting out of character half the time they are on screen, and a bunch of incomprehensible antagonists who never maintain consistent motivations. Truly poor writing, there is nothing redeeming about the characters in this series.Overall, this is one of the worst spin offs I have ever seen, I am thoroughly disappointed this anime failed on so many levels, between bad writing, bad characters, unremarkable sound design and outright lazy art, yashahime is a definite skip and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original series. and boring mockery of the original series lacking in every distinctive quality that made the original enjoyable.

Inuyasha was the very first anime i ever watched growing up and it left a pretty significant mark on me. This one the other hand was nice to see but i could never bring myself to watch it, out of fear it would ruin how i felt about the original. I found myself the most interested when the major characters from Inuyasha appeared. I watch every episode but it felt I was dredging through the whole series solely so I could see the scenes with the original character in it and know the context....I was very confused by the whole rainbow pearls and how they apparently were never heard of during the original adventure despite many demons knowing of them in these 2 shows. I was happy to see the original characters having grown up (even it they all looked pretty much the same) and had children. But I personally would've preferred a story with them just travelling around and doing stuff training the next generation over this twisted net of objectives the all had.Hell what I think pissed me off the most was the whole wolf tribe and Moroka. Koga and Ayame would have never allowed Inuyasha's and Kagome's daughter to be sent off with some random tribe member and then be cool with her pretty much being sold into pseudo-slavery. They probably would have raised her as their own even if that caused conflict within the tribe.

The holy trinity is badass. I didn't agree with the extremely low reviews of season 1 but I did see the show not living upto its full possible potential. Well season 2 flips that dynamics and delivers on all loose threads left hanging in the first act. Characters are more dynamic, lore fully explored, climaxes delivered and story is coherent. In the essence this passed the Inuyasha vibe check while being a coherent interesting story by itself. I think this is a reasonably well done show and should be seen as itself...and not compared to Inuyasha even though it is set up in the same world.

So both Season 1 and Season 2 get 7/10 from me.Review:-In most ways better than Season 1 and did enjoy myself watching season 2 every week but honestly both Season 1 and 2 are unnecessary and after watching the ending of Season 1 the ending of season 2 lacks that impact.On the good side of Season 2:- Finally the girls seem more like ""nakama"".All Moroha wanted was that and she got it and she no longer felt like a  comedy side character, Towa isn\'t...OP in this and though she is clearly the Main Protagonist of the story she doesn\'t completely take over screen time which should have been given to Setsuna or Moroha or all 3 of them. Setsuna was awesome in Season 1 and she is equally awesome in Season 2.Takechiyo is a surprise. I hated his character in Season 1 really hated the way he was written and Season 2 actually made me care for him. He feels like a friend to Moroha and Moroha and Takechiyo definitely get along better than Inuyasha and Shippo did.Sesshomaru as always steals the show! Everytime he\'s on screen love it!Inuyasha and Kagome were handled well too. (spoilerish? Loved the Reunion. Fav ep. Inuyasha and Moroha are so sweet to watch. So awkward at first but Inuyasha quickly gets over that and Inuyasha as a dad is a must see! At least watch that Ep even if you don\'t watch the others.)Season 2 definitely has better story pacing compared to Season 1. The problem with Season 2 is the impactfullness of it. It fell short to Season 1 in that aspect.A good happy ending no doubt but I just felt like \'something was missing\' When Moroha and Towa fought Kirinmaru that sense excitement I got was completely not there in Season 2.If you don\'t mind not having that, then it will like a present neatly gift wrapped with a bow, where in the end everyone is happy which is also nice. Not every story needs an epic showdown.Just remember no one really is a bad guy in this. Everyone are in the grey area you could say....though the only reason we accept that is the way the \'sengoku jidai\' is presented and how it\'s normal to almost die and also die.Frankly if Tenseiga and Akuru weren\'t there we wouldn\'t be this chill about how they handled Kirinmaru and Zero. Rion and Kirinmaru is definitely an interesting plotline and so are Kirinmaru\'s incarnations (Osamu Kirin and Riku) even if Osamu Kirin still doesn\'t make sense to me.....Sound:- Season 1 is way better than Season 2.They are alright.Art:- It\'s fine.

I don't remember the dialogue being so awful corny, and redundant. the story could have been easily four seasons and they did it in 2. The character development was nonexistent and the only ones I liked were the original group from Inuyasha.This was a disappointing end to a rushed story and not one I hope gets a third season.

Some backstory on how things started for Half demon princess was decent and the intro to the big bad were nice but really lacked cohesion.This second season not only plays to fans service by bringing in the right amount and the right placement of the OG cast but gives the new cast enough space to spread their wings and flourish as their own characters.Old tropes are introduced with new twists, supporting cast is really fleshed out and plays to important plot elements in the...story.Some fight sequences can be boring and predictable but adding some consequences to the actions of the characters OPness helps.

However, my feelings about it are mixed. I genuinely enjoyed witnessing how the characters from the original series have evolved over the past ten years. It brought back a strong sense of nostalgia from my younger days when I used to watch the show on TV. I won't delve into the graphics, animation, or the storyline because, for me, they were good enough. My primary criticism pertains to the characters.Concerning the main characters, I appreciate the way they were developed, particularly Setsuna, who appeared...to be the central character. My only critique is that they could have given Moroha more screen time. To the best of my recollection, she only had three episodes that focused on her. It would have been more enjoyable to delve deeper into her character, as the way the show handled it felt somewhat superficial. Nevertheless, I still found it enjoyable in the end.The main issue with the series revolves around Towa. I'm not certain what the author had in mind when creating her character, but it doesn't appear to have been well-executed. Her motivations and development come across as shallow, and what's worse is how she becomes overpowered when the plot demands it, without any genuine character growth. Even in the original series, characters possessed hidden powers, but they had to discover and master them over time, leading to character development. In Towa's case, she seems to effortlessly master her powers as soon as she discovers them and defeats her enemies. For instance, when Towa received her new sword/flute in the second season, there was no prior indication that she knew how to play the flute. It felt too convenient for her to suddenly possess this skill.Towa's character remains stagnant throughout the series, from episode 1 to episode 48 (considering both seasons as one). She shows no significant character growth, unlike Setsuna and Moroha, who do develop over the course of the series. In summary, Towa comes across as an underdeveloped character, and if she were absent from the show, she wouldn't be missed. Of course, this would require some adjustments to ensure the storyline makes sense, but in the end, the show could have been just as enjoyable or even better with only Setsuna and Moroha.In the end, I didn't expect to go into such detail, but I needed to express my thoughts.

As a matter of fact, I was not planning on even watching this show. This show is supposed to be the legacy sequel to the anime InuYasha and here’s the thing: As flawed as I think it is, InuYasha is an anime that holds a very special place in my heart. It was one of the first shounen anime that I had ever really gotten into, and it was also the first anime that I completed over 100 episodes for. Even to this day, whenever I think about or...see a clip of it or hear some of the soundtrack, this strong wave of nostalgia hits me because it reminds me of a simpler time when I was first becoming an anime fan and scared to come out of my college dorm room all day (for personal reasons I won’t get into) so I would stay in my dorm room and one of the anime that I would totally binge on was InuYasha.It’s one of those anime that I can still remember most of the lore and character names off the top of my head. So I guess you could say I’m a fan of it, but again, that’s mostly because of nostalgia. And if you’ve read my review of InuYasha, during the end of it I subtly mentioned this show that I have unfortunately finished, saying that I hope that I wouldn’t have to watch it because I had heard that it’s not that good. And oh boy, do I wish that was still the case.Because I had always kind of known about Yashahime. I had seen its page on Crunchyroll a few times back when I still had a Crunchyroll account and just assumed that it wasn’t very good without even watching it. It just looked like soulless fanfiction that was only made to cash in on an already established IP. (Boruto cough cough). And for a few years, I didn’t give Yashahime a single thought. Until recently when I started seeing a few clips of it on YouTube and unluckily for me, my curiosity peaked and the nostalgia baited me once again as I decided to give it a shot with an open mind even though I was extremely skeptical.Because the InuYasha story ended like a decade ago. That series had already tied up all the loose ends with no hints of a sequel in sight. I myself was pretty satisfied with how it ended, so I moved on with my life as well as other people. So after a finale that’s that conclusive, you really need a good reason to continue the series. So does Yashahime justify its existence?Well…uhh…yeah, no not really.I kinda feel like I’m getting ahead of myself with what makes this series as mediocre as it is, however I don’t really wanna do a play by play of what happens in every single episode. There’s 2 seasons with 24 episodes each, I feel like that would be a waste of everyone’s time.I will say though that this show wasn’t as much of a massive failure as I was expecting it to be, I can’t totally hate on it. There were a few moments and aspects that I thought were kinda neat, kind of intriguing. Like idk I think some of the action scenes were somewhat fun to watch and even pretty epic sometimes. I think the best moments in this series for me though would be whenever the OG characters would appear and do something or interact with one another even if it’s not that often and was kind of unnecessary to see because again, I thought their stories ended just fine and I wasn’t curious on what they were up to afterwards. But I guess as a fan, it was still nice to see the characters that I already knew and liked again and really reminded me of a better show that I wish I was still watching.Literally the series premiere is a perfect example of what I’m talking about. It is just full-on InuYasha fan service which I’ll admit, was making me very happy and nostalgic. But at the same time, I realized that this show’s way of hooking me in was not in introducing the new characters and getting to know them because it’s their story now. Rather, this show relies on the characters you already know thinking they’re going to take center stage again, which they obviously don’t.But that’s the first issue with this sequel, it doesn't really stand on its own two feet. As this sequel is very reliant on its predecessor that it starts to become annoying. It totally expects that you have seen the original because they make SOOO many references to it just so the fanboys and girls can go like: “OMG, I remember that!” Not just from different callbacks to that OG show but even down to the music making reference to the InuYasha theme and other themes from the OG. Which is kinda disappointing because I think the new soundtrack isn’t half bad. Kaoru Wada did the music and he also did the music for the original, and it sounds great. It’s probably the one thing about this series that’s consistently enjoyable and I guess that goes for the animation as well.As far as the characters go, while I think the three main leads are likable enough I suppose, I just find it very predictable that they're the children of some of the OG characters. Now any normal writer for this story would be like: “Yeah why not make a sequel about InuYasha’s daughter and Sesshoumaru’s daughters?” But I can’t understand the mentality of wanting every character to relate to other characters that we already know. It makes the universe way smaller that Moroha is InuYasha’s daughter. It’s also really dumb, like it would just be bad writing.It’s like how some Star Wars fans got upset that Rey wasn’t related to like Palpatine or some other popular character in the SW universe in The Last Jedi, but then people got upset again when she WAS revealed to be the daughter of Palpatine in The Rise of Skywalker. This sequel falls into that particular trap and it suffers for it. Imagine how much more interesting this show would be if it was about characters who weren’t related to the OG characters, and this sequel would be its own separate thing that just happens to take place in the InuYasha universe. I think that would be pretty cool. But no, we don’t really get that.Also the main villain who I forgot the name of is just boring and bland. He’s basically just another Naraku but if he didn’t have a personality or cool demon powers. Oh and this goes for every other villain and side character too, they’re all a lesser version of a character from the OG. Like the character Takechiyo is literally just Shippo 2.0. You know, I think the actual Shippo only showed up in that series premiere and then showed up a little bit in season 2. And holy shit, I almost forgot that Koga was in this show…for about a few seconds, I don’t even think he had any lines lol.Now while I think the story here could’ve been worse than what we got, it still feels uninspired and again, it kinda fails to justify its existence. For one, you know how the main emotional core of InuYasha was romance right? Well, this show doesn’t really have that. Which is fine, except for some reason they do try to shoehorn in a romance of some sorts between Towa and this guy named Riku and it’s just not very convincing. Which is the exact opposite of how InuYasha developed its romance in that story. The reason the romance worked so well there was because it was built up naturally throughout the show’s progression even though I think it could've been kind of drawn out at some points. It was the main aspect that made InuYasha stand out from the other shounen at the time of it’s release. So I find it ironic that Yashahime is literally doing romance the same way every other shounen was doing at the time InuYasha was still airing: appearing out of nowhere and being underdeveloped.But anyway, the basic plot in a nutshell is that Towa, Setsuna and Moroha are searching for the dream butterfly because Setsuna doesn’t have any memories of Towa being her sister because if she did have her memories, the series would just be over. To put it bluntly, Setsuna has amnesia, and can I just say that amnesia is probably the worst plot device in the history of storytelling. She seriously doesn't have any dreams and forgot her entire life with Towa. That is more than ridiculous to me. But this is only in the first season thankfully. I do think season two improves its story and pacing although not by much. I mean it’s like 10% better, which isn’t really saying a lot.But for most of the time, Towa, Setsuna and Moroha are just meandering and doing side quests that really don’t move the story forward all that often. I mean InuYasha did have a similar problem at first, but it slowly started to move away from that as the series went on with the exception of filler episodes. But that problem is so much worse here because that flaw persists through almost the whole show. Like in the OG show it was literally the first freaking episode where Kagome goes to the feudal era, this show on the other hand takes FOREVER to get anywhere. It’s not until the 4th episode where we finally go back to the feudal era. But again, it’s really only season one that has these issues the most.Also one thing about the story that I find kinda odd is that Towa and Setsuna’s father is Sesshoumaru but their mother is Rin. Yeah, that child who followed and admired Sesshomaru in the OG show, grew up to be the mother of Towa and Setsuna. Now idk what their ages are (it’s revealed in season 2 that Rin is 18) but in InuYasha, it looked like Rin was WAY younger than Sesshomaru. So did like Sesshomaru wait until Rin got older so they could have children together? If so, that’s pretty weird and sus and I know there were like some intimate relationships between characters in the OG show who had slightly different ages from one another, but this is like a whole nother level of questionable.But that’s nothing compared to the one thing that I really hate in the story of Yashahime, which is that I absolutely despise how there’s another Shikon Jewel. That’s right, the mcguffin that took InuYasha and his friends over a hundred episodes to collect all the pieces for and then destroy, there’s now just another one. Which is honestly the biggest insult that this show has to offer to the original. All of InuYasha and his friends' accomplishments don’t really mean shit anymore because there’s just another Shikon Jewel out there. Like, talk about shameless. You wanna know how even more shameless this show is? They literally utilize clips ripped straight from the OG series without even altering them or polishing them, maybe to make the clips look more modern during some of the flashback sequences, it’s just lazy.And to be honest, by season 2 I kind of just started watching this show on autopilot as I was really waiting to get it all over with. I was thinking of dropping it but I felt I had come too far to do that. Even though I think the show finished much stronger than it started, it wasn’t really enough to save the whole show for me but it was enough to make it at least a semi-watchable show.But overall, there’s just a lack of soul, a lack of inspiration, and a lack of identity because just like Towa, Setsuna and Moroha, this show is totally living in the shadow of its more successful series. And while I did say that I liked those characters, I think I would’ve liked them more if they were in a better show. So I’m pretty disappointed but that was to be expected. I mean it’s not an awful show but it’s still deeply flawed with the execution missing way more than hitting. There's really no reason to watch it ever again and I think there would be no harm in me wiping this series from my memory and pretending that it’s not canon or doesn’t exist.You know what, let’s just leave the InuYasha franchise alone after this for the love of GOD please. see a clip of it or hear some of the soundtrack, this strong wave of nostalgia hits me because it reminds me of a simpler time when I was first becoming an anime fan and scared to come out of my college dorm room all day (for personal reasons I won’t get into) so I would stay in my dorm room and one of the anime that I would totally binge on was InuYasha.It’s one of those anime that I can still remember most of the lore and character names off the top of my head. So I guess you could say I’m a fan of it, but again, that’s mostly because of nostalgia. And if you’ve read my review of InuYasha, during the end of it I subtly mentioned this show that I have unfortunately finished, saying that I hope that I wouldn’t have to watch it because I had heard that it’s not that good. And oh boy, do I wish that was still the case.Because I had always kind of known about Yashahime. I had seen its page on Crunchyroll a few times back when I still had a Crunchyroll account and just assumed that it wasn’t very good without even watching it. It just looked like soulless fanfiction that was only made to cash in on an already established IP. (Boruto cough cough). And for a few years, I didn’t give Yashahime a single thought. Until recently when I started seeing a few clips of it on YouTube and unluckily for me, my curiosity peaked and the nostalgia baited me once again as I decided to give it a shot with an open mind even though I was extremely skeptical.Because the InuYasha story ended like a decade ago. That series had already tied up all the loose ends with no hints of a sequel in sight. I myself was pretty satisfied with how it ended, so I moved on with my life as well as other people. So after a finale that’s that conclusive, you really need a good reason to continue the series. So does Yashahime justify its existence?Well…uhh…yeah, no not really.I kinda feel like I’m getting ahead of myself with what makes this series as mediocre as it is, however I don’t really wanna do a play by play of what happens in every single episode. There’s 2 seasons with 24 episodes each, I feel like that would be a waste of everyone’s time.I will say though that this show wasn’t as much of a massive failure as I was expecting it to be, I can’t totally hate on it. There were a few moments and aspects that I thought were kinda neat, kind of intriguing. Like idk I think some of the action scenes were somewhat fun to watch and even pretty epic sometimes. I think the best moments in this series for me though would be whenever the OG characters would appear and do something or interact with one another even if it’s not that often and was kind of unnecessary to see because again, I thought their stories ended just fine and I wasn’t curious on what they were up to afterwards. But I guess as a fan, it was still nice to see the characters that I already knew and liked again and really reminded me of a better show that I wish I was still watching.Literally the series premiere is a perfect example of what I’m talking about. It is just full-on InuYasha fan service which I’ll admit, was making me very happy and nostalgic. But at the same time, I realized that this show’s way of hooking me in was not in introducing the new characters and getting to know them because it’s their story now. Rather, this show relies on the characters you already know thinking they’re going to take center stage again, which they obviously don’t.But that’s the first issue with this sequel, it doesn't really stand on its own two feet. As this sequel is very reliant on its predecessor that it starts to become annoying. It totally expects that you have seen the original because they make SOOO many references to it just so the fanboys and girls can go like: “OMG, I remember that!” Not just from different callbacks to that OG show but even down to the music making reference to the InuYasha theme and other themes from the OG. Which is kinda disappointing because I think the new soundtrack isn’t half bad. Kaoru Wada did the music and he also did the music for the original, and it sounds great. It’s probably the one thing about this series that’s consistently enjoyable and I guess that goes for the animation as well.As far as the characters go, while I think the three main leads are likable enough I suppose, I just find it very predictable that they're the children of some of the OG characters. Now any normal writer for this story would be like: “Yeah why not make a sequel about InuYasha’s daughter and Sesshoumaru’s daughters?” But I can’t understand the mentality of wanting every character to relate to other characters that we already know. It makes the universe way smaller that Moroha is InuYasha’s daughter. It’s also really dumb, like it would just be bad writing.It’s like how some Star Wars fans got upset that Rey wasn’t related to like Palpatine or some other popular character in the SW universe in The Last Jedi, but then people got upset again when she WAS revealed to be the daughter of Palpatine in The Rise of Skywalker. This sequel falls into that particular trap and it suffers for it. Imagine how much more interesting this show would be if it was about characters who weren’t related to the OG characters, and this sequel would be its own separate thing that just happens to take place in the InuYasha universe. I think that would be pretty cool. But no, we don’t really get that.Also the main villain who I forgot the name of is just boring and bland. He’s basically just another Naraku but if he didn’t have a personality or cool demon powers. Oh and this goes for every other villain and side character too, they’re all a lesser version of a character from the OG. Like the character Takechiyo is literally just Shippo 2.0.

The way the new characters and old ones worked together was amazing as they didn't over shade the new ones and the reunions were sweet. My favorite characters were Riku who had amazing character development and Towa who I enjoyed seeing getting stronger and getting a better understanding of the new world she's in. The story was wrapped up good and alot of questions I had were answered as the story progressed. The last episode did leave on a sorta open ending tho so...I'm hoping for a new season and story in the future! I'm hoping for a new season and story in the future!"", ""Season two of Yashahime was both better and worse than season 1. Once again I liked the art, and sound designs in this anime a lot and those did not take a dip to the worse in my opinion in this season. If anything it felt like those two at times were even better than in season one. I even feel like characters were working better in this season, and my girl Moroha finally had much more to her than just being a comic relief like I felt like she was for the most part in season 1. But more about that later.I want to...start by saying that despite me finding season two worse in some aspects, I still think it's an enjoyable watch. I was excited tremendously for this season to continue each week and that was due to the story being better. Well, more so that we didn't need a full 24 episode season to set everything in else to start and have no resolution at the end since season 1 was basically that. Many storylines were resolved in this season and I think Zero's storyline was executed beautifully. There is no doubt in me that it was the best part for me personally of this season. However, I cannot bring myself to give this season a better score altogether despite liking it more than the first.Why though? Well, it has to do with the ending of season 2 (not the very last episode, that was very cute, although I would've preferred to not end the season with an episode that is kinda filler-y). All the build-up in season one and the first part of season two were giving me this feeling of a very grandiose event that would take place. Something big and truly show-stopping, almost like the final act of Inuyasha. What we got was disappointing.This might be on the spoilers! side, so skip to the next paragraph just in case if you want to avoid this. In a sense, it felt like the girls, our main heroes, didn't take that big of a part in the resolution of the plot lines. Yes, they were present and they were fighting, but they weren't fighting the characters I felt like they should've. Not to mention, having them separated so often throughout the anime felt awkward when big fights were taking place in different locations and we had to jump in between. The final fights weren't an exception. I liked the ending better because at least we got an actual ending, but it lacked the impact the series had been building up for it.Aside from me not liking the ending that much, I also had a problem with some of the choices. As I said, the girls were separated quite often and we had to jump from girl to girl to see what was happening. Those were weird choices as they made it hard to keep up with the pace at times and focused on what was happening and where.Enough about the story and to the characters. This alone could've bumped up the over all score because the characterisation was aced this time around. For most of the characters, there was an upgrade from being rather one dimensional 99% of the time to being likeable characters with meaning to them. Moroha is one that comes to mind the most since I was really sad originally to see she lacked the depth I was hoping to see in her. In this season, however, she was amazing. We got to see many new sides of her and she was so much more than the comic relief.But not all of the characters were executed well and I think I am not alone in saying that Shippoo wasn't needed. I won't go into details, but basically, every single time I saw him on the screen I almost wanted to quit the episode and anime. His addition wasn't good and I think his presence dampened the whole feeling of scenes just before and after.All in all, I think the second season is still enjoyable for the most part. However, there were things that pushed me to give this a 7 despite all individual scores being 8 and above. It is better than season one until the final few episodes that felt like they were stalling and jumping around like crazy.

Actually no, that's a lie. It felt like I was watching the corpse of a long finished show being dragged through the corporate money pit of recycling old properties for a quick profit. Sorry that's the cynic in me talking. The first season managed to keep me engaged enough even though these characters were new by having their past be shrouded in mystery and keeping the audience guessing as to what happened to the old Inuyasha party from the old days. We got snippets here and there about what they might be...up to but it turns out the explanation for why they were never around was pretty lame. It is a pretty cool moment when they all finally are there together on screen again, though I felt a little bad at how they mistreated poor Shippo. He's a comic relief side-kick, but holy cow they didn't have to make him such a punching bag.Kirinmaru and his various offspring/incarnations were a poor substitute for Naraku. I still think of Naraku as one of the great anime villains of my childhood simply because of the sheer scope of his will that you could feel in nearly every aspect of the original story. Kirinmaru, while technically a more daunting threat and a force that's been around since the days of Towa and gang's grandfather, is just a boring villain. Naraku was the kind of evil that you love to hate, just pure cartoonishly villainous right down to the core. Kirinmaru is just there. Like yeah he's kind of evil, but he's honestly getting shown up by his weird human alter ego or his sister most of the time.The ending felt a little forced or rushed or whatever you want to call it. Suffice to say it wasn't very satisfying. But that was true of the original Inuyasha as well. Maybe they'll bring it back in another 15 years with Towa and Setsuna's quarter-demon babies, or quarter-human if they wanna try and shake things up. I dunno, it's a show that on paper sounded kind of neat but in execution was sadly just like Boruto: constantly inviting comparisons to the original while never quite living up to it.

That is how I describe the second season of Hanyou no Yashahime.As I said in my review from the first season, my final score for this show is not a 10, but I will keep it until the end because even though I think it does not deserve a max score, it still keeps a lot of the original Inuyasha and can still bring a lot of enjoyment from old fans in general. I would say this second season\'s real score...is, again, around an 8.It starts literally right where the first season ends since it ended with A HUGE cliffhanger. The first season\'s writting was all over the place at the start, but at the very end it started to grow and it only gets better through the second season. It was fun to see the anime\'s score growing slowly each episode, which only shows how people were actually getting convinced by its writting and pace.For me, the first arc of this season is amazing and even after the end of said arc (around ep 12) the story keeps a strong pace for a few episodes, before going back to its roots. In other words, to its rushed pace like how it was when season 1 started. Said that, I would still state that the anime is still great up to around episode 18, which is actually a lot if you consider the total of episodes.The problem is everything that happens during those last 5-6 episodes. People change minds like they change clothes (well, not a good comparison since people do not actually change clothes in this anime) and everything scaled up just too fast. Small threat to huge threat, to small threat again to world-ending threat. It is all over the place. At some point you realise that even the characters are tired and just want this mess to end already, antagonists included. The big highlight from these last few episodes is Sesshoumaru, but I will hold myself from giving spoilers and just say that, for me, he carries the show in the mid of all this mess at the ending.Talking about Sesshoumaru, the characters here are mostly good. Not taking into account that most of the characters\' development is sacrified to rush the ending, most of the characters have a good development and you just get really happy for Sesshoumaru at the end. His growth is probably one of the best you will ever see and Yashahime gives it a beautiful end. Other characters that I loved were Zero and Setsuna and their development was great as well. I even found myself liking Towa a bit through the end even though she was far from being one of my favorites.Inuyasha and Kagome are ways more present here than in first season but since the main focus are the three main girls and specially Sesshoumaru\'s family, they are still treated as just side characters and I do not see any problem with that, they were the main focus on the OG anime, so lets give others some spotlight this time. Moroha is not treated like a comedy relief anymore and she has the proper development she deserved back in season one. She is not one of my favorite characters but is still a fun character and I can understand the many reasons why she is a fan favorite. And we finally get to see Shippou again, he worked a lot through the end fo the story.The animation is fine. This anime is more focused on its story that we do not have that many fights we had in the first season. The important fights in the first arc of second season are just ok and the final fights at the end are actually good. Specially when Sesshoumaru is involved.The OST though. If there is something that they nailed (again) is the soundtrack. Some small rearranges from the OG Inuyasha and some new music are simply amazing. Some moments at the end of first arc just made me cry because of how they nailed the story and music to make it emotional. Oh, that Sesshoumaru (always him) theme playing when he fights...Not to mention that I enjoyed a lot both Openings and Endings. Have no complaints about this show when it comes to its overall soundtrack.Even though Takahashi-sensei was only watching over the planning/writting and wasn\'t directly involved in this anime outside from the character design, it still holds up a lot from the Original Inuyasha and I had a lot of ""oh that\'s so Inuysha"" moments while watching it. Yes the story ends almost abruptly, but the reason is probably because they were not planning for a third season, so they had no other option other than rush it, unfortunately, because would they ever keep the quality they had up until a bit over half this season, I would not bother a season 3. But right now, I\'m fine with they way it ended.It might not be the greatest of the sequels, but it was still great to see our loved characters back with a different background, now focused on their kids\' journey. is, again, around an 8.It starts literally right where the first season ends since it ended with A HUGE cliffhanger.

At some point you realise that even the characters are tired and just want this mess to end already, antagonists included. The big highlight from these last few episodes is Sesshoumaru, but I will hold myself from giving spoilers and just say that, for me, he carries the show in the mid of all this mess at the ending.Talking about Sesshoumaru, the characters here are mostly good. Not taking into account that most of the characters\' development is sacrified to rush the ending, most of the characters have a good development and you just get really happy for Sesshoumaru at the end. His growth is probably one of the best you will ever see and Yashahime gives it a beautiful end. Other characters that I loved were Zero and Setsuna and their development was great as well. I even found myself liking Towa a bit through the end even though she was far from being one of my favorites.Inuyasha and Kagome are ways more present here than in first season but since the main focus are the three main girls and specially Sesshoumaru\'s family, they are still treated as just side characters and I do not see any problem with that, they were the main focus on the OG anime, so lets give others some spotlight this time. Moroha is not treated like a comedy relief anymore and she has the proper development she deserved back in season one. She is not one of my favorite characters but is still a fun character and I can understand the many reasons why she is a fan favorite. And we finally get to see Shippou again, he worked a lot through the end fo the story.The animation is fine. This anime is more focused on its story that we do not have that many fights we had in the first season. The important fights in the first arc of second season are just ok and the final fights at the end are actually good. Specially when Sesshoumaru is involved.The OST though. If there is something that they nailed (again) is the soundtrack. Some small rearranges from the OG Inuyasha and some new music are simply amazing. Some moments at the end of first arc just made me cry because of how they nailed the story and music to make it emotional. Oh, that Sesshoumaru (always him) theme playing when he fights...Not to mention that I enjoyed a lot both Openings and Endings. Have no complaints about this show when it comes to its overall soundtrack.Even though Takahashi-sensei was only watching over the planning/writting and wasn\'t directly involved in this anime outside from the character design, it still holds up a lot from the Original Inuyasha and I had a lot of ""oh that\'s so Inuysha"" moments while watching it. Yes the story ends almost abruptly, but the reason is probably because they were not planning for a third season, so they had no other option other than rush it, unfortunately, because would they ever keep the quality they had up until a bit over half this season, I would not bother a season 3. But right now, I\'m fine with they way it ended.It might not be the greatest of the sequels, but it was still great to see our loved characters back with a different background, now focused on their kids\' journey.', ""Real score: 6.5I knew it! I've never been a fan of Inuyasha even though I was a 90s kid. In fact, I like this more than Inuyasha as it's more focused on the girls rather than a general romance comedy isekai. This was dilapidated in the former season as it was the worst thing in the world, and guess what? This was one of the few decent ones that I've watched from Fall and Winter 2021.The best: It's entertaining enough to follow on the story they're trying to tell us. And it's interesting for the simple fact that we're able to see what happened...later to the characters from the original series.The worst: It's more intended for kids, not surprising. There are dark elements, but not too deep or impactful. It's true the script leaves something to be desired.I didn't expect anything more than being entertained. I didn't fall in love with this sequel, but I still feel it's lovable. later to the characters from the original series.The worst: It's more intended for kids, not surprising.

Some scenes don\'t make sense and are explained later without any credible logic, but I guess they had to keep the audience satisfied with what they wanted to watch.

It\'s very entertaining but don\'t try to understand the why to everything or look deeprly...into it because as I said before some things don\'t make sense, which means you\'re not gonna enjoy the show thinking how something like that could happen.(spoiler) I think it\'s nice they ""brought back"" Kikyo, I\'m sure a lot of fans me included liked to see her again.

I\'d guess my review of Season 1 did some harsh numbers for everyone to stop watching Yashahime after the awful blender that was the resurgence of the new-generation Boruto flak that now the Inuyasha franchise has literally and unfortunately carved its name in, but what do I know. And that\'s where Season 2 comes in, and rightaway it solves all the problems of its preceding season...by having an ending and a resolution. That\'s just it.Most of the problems in Season 1 were just the foundation for Season 2 to solve, and even going back a bit to scour the cliffhanger (since this...sequel is a continuation after all), I\'d say that it still suffers the same writing issues as Inuyasha, and for a lack of better words, is the core theme of the series as a whole: seemingly unconnected stories that connect to a large-scale operation to defeat demons. The character dynamics really improved as the series pads on, and going back to my Season 1 review, for example: where Moroha was a sitting duck in the presence of Towa and Setsuna\'s sisterhood and family problems, she is more grounded this time to help them both, aside from standing out (which she does even less this episode, thank goodness).The idea about Season 2 is just one word: reunion, reconciliation. And bringing back the OG cast in and of itself does the servitude well to re-connect the children with their parents, and this is easily one of the highlights of the sequel to both good and evil. It feels more grounded and less like a modern Inuyasha on reboot and repeat, you wouldn\'t want to watch the same thing more than once nowadays.But otherwise, this is Sunrise\'s very last work as the animation studio is transitioning in the Bandai Namco parent company as Bandai Namco Filmworks while the Sunrise name will be withdrawn solely for IP creation. You will be missed, Sunrise, and you did good for close to 50 years of animation since 1972.

Black Bullet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20787/Black_Bullet,"['Black Bullet is one of the many light novel adaptations that aired during Spring 2014. You might know the other ones as The Irregular at Magic High School, No Game No Life, and Chaika - The Coffin Princess. It started out okay, but got progressively weaker as it went on, before turning into an unentertaining show that turned out to be a rushed and half-baked adaptation. Shame, it had potential to be way better.If you\'ve read the synopsis on the show\'s page on this site, it\'ll tell you that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity is practically on the brink of extinction,...having been driven into a corner by powerful monsters. You might think that this concept sounds familiar; kind of like 2013\'s popular Attack on Titan. With a premise like that, it drew in a lot of viewers who, one might say, could have been looking for a sci-fi version of Attack on Titan or something. However, the thing about this show is that it seems to have entirely forgotten that it was a post-apocalyptic show. You see plenty of tons of healthy-looking people on the rather clean streets, the towns look clean and well-tended, and the economy seems to be in such good condition that they\'re able to afford things like prosthetic limbs made of tissue resembling human flesh and whatnot.The art is standard fare, all things considered. The style isn\'t anything special; it\'s generic and nothing about it really seems to stick out. Characters and objects look polished enough, and the actual animation is fairly crisp when there\'s good action going on, though it\'s not enough to make the actual fights that appealing or interesting to watch. In the end though, it gets the job done, but ultimately doesn\'t stick out at all. The designs were fairly neat though, I\'ll give it that. I liked the designs of the Gastrea, all two times they appeared or whatever.I\'m quite fond of Shiro Sagisu\'s work. He did an outstanding job with the music for the Evangelion franchise, along with a great job at the soundtrack for the Berserk: Golden Age Arc films. However, this must be easily his weakest work. Background music is generic and forgettable, except for probably two or so songs that play during battles, which can give a good feel of intensity. The opening, ""black bullet,"" respectively named after the show and light novel, is fairly pleasant to listen to, but it isn\'t anything I\'ll remember in a month or so. Same goes for the main ending theme, ""Tokohana,"" though I do really like when it starts playing near the end of an episode. The voice acting isn\'t anything to write home for either. You have Yuki Kaji as the main character, Rentaro Satomi, but he isn\'t all that interesting to listen to. He always seems depressed, angry, tired, bored, or sounds like he\'s crying. So in short, he practically sounds the same as when he voiced Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan. I suppose I should give an honorable mention to Yui Horie (Minori Kushieda, Toradora!) for trying her best with what she got, and to Rikiya Koyama (Kiritsugu Emiya, Fate/Zero) for still having that charming, nonchalantly badass voice, even if his role was fairly limited.The characters are bland and unmemorable. Rentaro practically has no notable personality traits other than typical ""brave"" and ""determined"" that can be found in literally a hundred other characters who are far better written. He reminds me of Kirito from Sword Art Online in a way, in that not only does he have no notable personality, he has a harem for practically no reason, at least one girl in each harem being a little girl under 13. The main difference though is that while Kirito is overpowered, Rentaro seems underpowered in contrast. Despite being equipped with skills like knowledge of martial arts, a fairly high level of agility, exceptional marksmanship, and practically superhuman strength and speed due to his prosthetic limbs, he never seems to win, and even when he does, it\'s not even memorable or anything. Now, there\'s nothing wrong with making the main character an underdog, but a well-written underdog has to be a well-written character. The main reason why Rocky Balboa is a good underdog is because he\'s a genuine nice person. When he\'s not boxing, he\'s a really sweet guy, like around his lover Adrian and her brother Paulie, and he stands up for those he cares for. There\'s time and dedication given into giving the audience a good idea of what Rocky is like, which ultimately makes us want him to win against all odds against more experienced and stronger boxers like Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago. However, in Black Bullet, since Rentaro is a bland and forgettable character, it makes the audience not care whether he wins or loses, and thus, destroys all tension in a fight. Every time something happens to him, he begins to doubt all he knows, building the foundation of character development, but he never visibly develops, though given that the source material is still ongoing, not all is lost yet, since all these events that happen to him could potentially act as catalysts to a giant, grand development. But I suppose we\'ll only know if there\'s a second season. The other characters aren\'t all that special either. Enju is the token ""energetic loli,"" similar to how Tina is the token ""lethargic loli"" who\'s only active when the situation calls for it, kind of like Shiro from No Game No Life. There\'s also Kisara ""Big Boobs"" Tendo, the president of Civil Security that Rentaro works for, who happens to be a childhood friend of our main character, but ultimately, she lacks depth like the other character and hardly develops her own identity until the last five minutes or so. There are also more generic characters like the aloof old friend, the cocky guy, the girl with cat ears (which is supposed to be explained in plot but we never actually see any more of this), the hikkomori, etc. The character who steals the show is Kagetane Hiruko, who is the main villain of it all, or is supposed to be anyway. He\'s smooth, charismatic, nonchalant, mysterious, and reminds me of V from V for Vendetta in some ways. It\'s a shame he doesn\'t get a lot of screen-time either.The enjoyment levels seemed to fluctuate for me at first, before going down to consistently being a chore to watch. It has an inconsistent tone akin to that of Elfen Lied. By day, happy-go-lucky comedy featuring boob groping, other fanservice, and loli sweetness. By night, it becomes (or tries to be) macabre and dark, though it only comes off as unnecessarily edgy for the sake of being edgy. The humor might get a small chuckle or two out of you, but at the end of the day, boob groping and comical misunderstandings aren\'t anything to write home to in the humor department.In the end, Black Bullet could have been a good show, but ultimately fails miserably. To say that it was rushed would be a big understatement indeed, what with not providing adequate world-building or characterization. I\'m sure the light novels are way better, but since the adaptation is poor, it\'s not exactly doing a good job at advertising the source material to me, and thus, fails as such. having been driven into a corner by powerful monsters.

The comedy is completely unintentional but it\'s what kept me watching week after week. Black Bullet is driven by manufactured drama and the characters are one dimensional cardboard cutouts with some dark backstories thrown in. Several important plot points are brought up and then never mentioned again, leaving the audience to wonder why we were even given this information in the first place.The story follows high school student and ""Promoter"" Satomi Rentaro and his loli partner Enju, who uses her...kept-in-check gastrea powers to kill full blown gastrea. Rentaro starts off being pretty mediocre as far as Promoters go, but he quickly rises through the ranks because of his inherent superiority and a sudden powerup.Although the story tries to be serious and mature, it fails miserably. We start off with the usual generic villain who wants to let the gastrea kill everyone in Tokyo because apparently anyone who can\'t defend defend themselves from giant monsters ought to die and it doesn\'t really get much better. There\'s an evil scientist named Ayn Rand, loli assassins, bad guys who have an irrational hatred of Rentaro, and a guy who built one of the varanium monoliths on the cheap so he could pocket the extra money. Sorry if I\'m making this sound good because really, it\'s not. Even when we get a big gastrea battle at the end the real action takes place off screen. All we get to see is the aftermath.The biggest problem with the show is that it has absolutely no idea how to have any kind of emotional impact on the audience. Minor characters are introduced only to die an episode or two later. Rentaro cries because he cared about them, but the viewer hardly knew them at all. Little girls in particular are subjected to brutal violence because what\'s worse than killing off an ordinary character? Killing off a child! This happens multiple times throughout the show and it serves no purpose other than to be ""shocking"" and briefly make Rentaro pause and wonder why he protects Tokyo. There\'s a death toward the end that annoyed me because of how it happened so nonchalently. When someone dies it should feel like they made a meaningful sacrifice. This felt like the character had such little regard for their own life that it wasn\'t really a sacrifice at all.Black Bullet has very little character growth. It may be that the show\'s rushed pacing gave Rentaro very little time for introspection, or that the story is basically one crisis after another. Either way, every character gets a dark backstory but that\'s pretty much it.Rentaro starts off as a mid-tier Promoter before he suddenly unlocks his potential and becomes ridiculously overpowered - except when he gets physically restrained by two guys right after a fight where he was demolishing concrete walls. He is always morally right and he demonstrates his superiority by triumphing over characters who hate him for very flimsy reasons. When a character unfairly persecuteshim, something conveniently happens that removes the obstacle and increases Rentaro\'s prestige. Everyone in a position of authority acts like a retard just so he can show how clever and perceptive he is.Kisara is Rentaro\'s tsundere friend. Her family is basically the Rothschilds of Japan except instead of banking, they teach their children absurdly overpowered martial arts and weapon techniques. You\'ll know this because the characters announce the name of the attack before they use it.The loli harem is there for comedy relief and pandering. The kind of ""humor"" here entails a gastrea-spider shoots sticky white web on Enju and constant flirting with Rentaro.If you like B-movies then boy, have I got the show for you. It tries to be deep but the pacing is so frenetic that all the characters come across as being extremely shallow. There\'s even a scene where a guy gets cut by a sword but doesn\'t realize it until his head EXPLODES a minute later.

Varanium may be black, but Black Bullet is comedy gold.', '**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Hey there folks! Have you ever wanted to see an anime that has a loli fanservice scene, a comedic tsundere romance scene, and a scene that features the complete and brutal genocide of children all within 2 minutes of each other? No? Good, because anyone who WOULD want to see that wouldn\'t know the first thing about writing a coherent TV show. Unfortunately for Black Bullet, one of this season\'s most unfortunately overrated series, there is plenty of incoherence to be found. This horribly confused action seinen is jam packed with arguably the worst pacing issues I\'ve ever seen, poor character development, and...lolis. Soooo many lolis. Sure, the series has its moments, but the plentiful flaws outnumber the few positives that Black Bullet has to offer.Synopsis: In a near future, where mankind lives in fear of viral parasites called Gastrea, humans have been forced into a small territory and live in constant fear of death. Satomi Rentaro, a member of the ""Civil Security"" (an organization specializing in fighting against the Gastrea), is tasked with defending mankind from this monstrous threat. His partner, Enju, is a 10 year old girl with large amounts of power due to her partially Gastrea-infected DNA; she is one of the many ""cursed children"" who are used to fight the Gastrea as humanity struggles to survive.Black Bullet\'s plot can easily be described as a mess for more then one reason. The first issue I will focus on is the MONUMENTALLY awful pacing, and trust me when I say it is monumental: Episodes 1-4 of Black Bullet are a shock to the system. I mean really, not a single person on planet Earth was prepared for the insanity that they witnessed over the course of those first 4 episodes. I\'m not exaggerating when I say that the ENTIRE anime could have been just these four episodes, because that\'s how much content they truly ""covered"" in so little time. The pace of the show was faster then a coked-up cheetah with rockets strapped to its back, I mean it was truly something to behold. This all culminated in the absolute clusterfuck that was episode 4, in which 5 or 6 different climaxes all happened in the same episode. Ridiculous? Yes. But admittedly, it was so unfathomably stupid that it was actually kind of fun. However, starting at episode 5, that cheetah crashes into a brick wall and stops dead in its tracks. The pacing of the show from then on out is a snail\'s pace, leaving the audience to wonder what the hell happened to the absurdity that this show opened up with. With all the ridiculousness that went on in episode 4, the show had nowhere to go but down in terms of mindless entertainment; it doomed itself. Of course, I don\'t mean to suggest that the ludicris pacing was something that the show should have tried to keep, because it was STUPIDLY fast, but I am saying that this show threw everything it had at us in the first 1/4th and then simply had nothing left. This brings me to my underling point: How in the hell did this happen?! I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never seen a more mystifying anomaly in anime writing EVER! It is the least consistent and most mind-boggling betrayal of story-telling 101 I\'ve ever had the displeasure of gazing upon. So congratulations Black Bullet, you win the ""Worst Pacing Ever"" award.The second reason that Black Bullet\'s plot is a failure would be that fact there is no consistent tone what so ever. I will refer you back to my opening paragraph to give you a taste of how truly bad this problem is…  This anime is trying to tell a mature and emotionally moving story, but then they decide to lace it with super-happy-fun-time with lolis, a cliché comedic tsundere romance, and then even more super-happy-fun-time with lolis. As if that wasn\'t bad enough, they do so without allowing ANY time at all for a gradual shift in mood; devastating shit that should have a huge effect on the characters and comedic relief happen within seconds of each other. News Flash: That doesn\'t work, and any writer worth the paper he prints the script on could tell you that. Did I mention that this show has a lot of lolis?That brings us to the characters, who are a bit hard to explain. Rentaro, the protagonist, receives no real character development at any point despite the fact that the plot could not have been more perfectly set up for him to receive some. For example, there was a scene in episode 10 that should have made him completely reevaluate himself, but he simply doesn\'t; we just get a 30 second scene of him thinking and then it\'s right back to the original plotline. Black Bullet instead tries to characterize Rentaro by making him a total badass, and while he definitely has some badass moments, he also has some moments that are the complete opposite of badass, so there is no consistency to his character at all. He is not a good protagonist. His love interest is a stereotypical tsundere; there is literally not a speck of originality to her, so I\'ll just move on. Rentaro\'s partners, the ""cursed children"", aka the lolis, are unbelievably aggravating to me. Let it be noted that I hate lolis, but I won\'t let that bias get in the way of this review. Enju, one of the lolis, is in love with Rentaro and makes contrived sex joke after contrived sex joke despite the fact that she is 10 years old. Some people find this funny; I don\'t. The rest of the lolis all have stereotypical personalities and no depth what so ever, so there isn\'t much to talk about there. The lolis are aggravating because they are the main source of the tone issues that the show suffers from, which I talked about earlier. They almost single handedly kill any chance this show had of being taken seriously, which it clearly is striving to do.In addition to the fact that the characters are remarkably unspectacular, they also have very poor chemistry with one another. One of the cornerstones of the plot is that Rentaro and Enju are very close to each other, and you want to know how we are supposed to know they are so close? Because we got a 15 second flashback scene that showed us how close they were. ...I mean… Really? They can\'t be serious, can they? Well, they most certainly are. Not a single relationship in Black Bullet is believable or relatable by any stretch of the imagination, and that can be attributed to the awful pacing of the show.While the plot of Black Bullet is awful and the characters leave a lot to be desired, it should be noted that the animation is good and the music is AMAZING. The show\'s OP and ED are both among the best of this season and the OST is very fitting for the show. The voice acting is also above average. Unfortunately, none of this is enough save the show from the slew of other problems that Black Bullet suffers from, and I do mean SUFFERS.In conclusion, Black Bullet is an action seinen that completely lacks direction on all fronts; both in its plot and in its characters. It has some redeeming factors and can be good for some mindless fun at times, but  it comes across as an absolute disaster more often then not. Good music and animation save this anime from being unwatchable, but I certainly do not recommend it. There are many better seinen anime out there. lolis. Soooo many lolis. Sure, the series has its moments, but the plentiful flaws outnumber the few positives that Black Bullet has to offer.Synopsis: In a near future, where mankind lives in fear of viral parasites called Gastrea, humans have been forced into a small territory and live in constant fear of death.

It is the least consistent and most mind-boggling betrayal of story-telling 101 I\'ve ever had the displeasure of gazing upon. So congratulations Black Bullet, you win the ""Worst Pacing Ever"" award.The second reason that Black Bullet\'s plot is a failure would be that fact there is no consistent tone what so ever. I will refer you back to my opening paragraph to give you a taste of how truly bad this problem is…  This anime is trying to tell a mature and emotionally moving story, but then they decide to lace it with super-happy-fun-time with lolis, a cliché comedic tsundere romance, and then even more super-happy-fun-time with lolis. As if that wasn\'t bad enough, they do so without allowing ANY time at all for a gradual shift in mood; devastating shit that should have a huge effect on the characters and comedic relief happen within seconds of each other. News Flash: That doesn\'t work, and any writer worth the paper he prints the script on could tell you that. Did I mention that this show has a lot of lolis?That brings us to the characters, who are a bit hard to explain. Rentaro, the protagonist, receives no real character development at any point despite the fact that the plot could not have been more perfectly set up for him to receive some. For example, there was a scene in episode 10 that should have made him completely reevaluate himself, but he simply doesn\'t; we just get a 30 second scene of him thinking and then it\'s right back to the original plotline. Black Bullet instead tries to characterize Rentaro by making him a total badass, and while he definitely has some badass moments, he also has some moments that are the complete opposite of badass, so there is no consistency to his character at all. He is not a good protagonist. His love interest is a stereotypical tsundere; there is literally not a speck of originality to her, so I\'ll just move on. Rentaro\'s partners, the ""cursed children"", aka the lolis, are unbelievably aggravating to me. Let it be noted that I hate lolis, but I won\'t let that bias get in the way of this review. Enju, one of the lolis, is in love with Rentaro and makes contrived sex joke after contrived sex joke despite the fact that she is 10 years old. Some people find this funny; I don\'t. The rest of the lolis all have stereotypical personalities and no depth what so ever, so there isn\'t much to talk about there. The lolis are aggravating because they are the main source of the tone issues that the show suffers from, which I talked about earlier. They almost single handedly kill any chance this show had of being taken seriously, which it clearly is striving to do.In addition to the fact that the characters are remarkably unspectacular, they also have very poor chemistry with one another. One of the cornerstones of the plot is that Rentaro and Enju are very close to each other, and you want to know how we are supposed to know they are so close? Because we got a 15 second flashback scene that showed us how close they were. ...I mean… Really? They can\'t be serious, can they? Well, they most certainly are. Not a single relationship in Black Bullet is believable or relatable by any stretch of the imagination, and that can be attributed to the awful pacing of the show.While the plot of Black Bullet is awful and the characters leave a lot to be desired, it should be noted that the animation is good and the music is AMAZING. The show\'s OP and ED are both among the best of this season and the OST is very fitting for the show. The voice acting is also above average. Unfortunately, none of this is enough save the show from the slew of other problems that Black Bullet suffers from, and I do mean SUFFERS.In conclusion, Black Bullet is an action seinen that completely lacks direction on all fronts; both in its plot and in its characters. It has some redeeming factors and can be good for some mindless fun at times, but  it comes across as an absolute disaster more often then not. Good music and animation save this anime from being unwatchable, but I certainly do not recommend it. There are many better seinen anime out there.', ""Black bullet is a anime that was adopted from a light novel. This series was being compare to attack on titan, or being called a copycat to attack on titan, but that can't be true since attack on titan isn't the first nor last to have these kind of story and settings. Coming into this series, it had a lot of hype from people who read the light novel or the manga. What most people didn't realize is that it would be adopted into 13 episodes which would mean the pacing would be rushed. So lets begin, I'll be reviewing this series in five category,...story,art,sound,character and enjoyment.Story 6/10: The story is about humans being forced to live in a small territory because of the attack of viral parasites named Gastrea. Now with this series just having 13 episodes, that means a lot of story progression would be lost and rushed. The thing that I find odd in this series is that The theme of the story is about humanity is on the verge of extinction, but I never get the impression that humanity is on the verge of extinction by huge bugs and that there is some sort of survival going on  here. Nobody cares about it. In fact, we don’t even see the population having anything to say about that, since the plot centers on the protagonist. If they had shown a few bugs attacking people even that would be enough. Just to give us viewers that humanity really is under a threat. I don't know if this is the flaw of the story itself or just because the series was rushed and a lot of things were taken out from the light novel.Art 7/10: Art is pretty good, and nice to look at.Sound 7/10: The sound is pretty good, I downloaded a few ost to listen to, I like the ost. I also like the opening is anyone getting a attack on titan feel to that opening or is it just me?Characters 4/10: The characters are pretty bland and two dimmensional. Each character has different personalities but what I find annoying is how easy the characters mood changes, like one moment everyone is sad then a minute later everyone is all happy, I personally think this series would've been way better if  lolis were not in it. also Enju is pretty annoying, when she calls out to Rentarou it makes me *facepalm* and just sometimes put me off and give me a different mood towards this series. Each characters also have a dark/sad past which can make it a little overwhelming.Enjoyment 7/10: I have to say with all the flaw and paced of this series, I did have a lot of fun watching it, the actions were short, but pretty good with the   epic soundtrack.overall: This series would've been so much better if it was adopted into 24 episodes instead of 13 episodes. I'm not a light novel or manga reader but even I can tell the pacing was rushed. Light novel readers has also confirmed my speculation. Well what can I say about this series, if you like lolis and want a series with good action and great soundtrack, then you should give black bullet a shot. story,art,sound,character and enjoyment.Story 6/10: The story is about humans being forced to live in a small territory because of the attack of viral parasites named Gastrea.

I\'m sure many of you would have heard the saying ""Why didn\'t they ride the eagles into Mordor"", well Black Bullet is the epitome of that saying.The story is very bad, it\'s full of cliché after cliché, the main character is yet another super special high school kid and the world revolves solely around his actions. He isn\'t just another gear in the machine of society, he is the one turning them, one Yuki Kaji shounen power up scream at a time.What makes some high school...kid with a loli by his side and a handgun shoved down the back of his pants better than thousands of trained soldiers? Nothing, but the plot wills it and it even fire special bullets capable of killing the monsters of the show, not even the Army seems to have access to that ammunition in Black Bullet. They even build 300 metre tall monoliths made out of the same material as Rentaro\'s ammunition, but yet thousands of trained soldiers are incapable of fighting the Gastrea that a bunch of sword and handgun wielding teens ad lolis are easily able to defeat.The characterisation is horrible and cliché, Tendo Kisara the main love interest (if you could call her that) jumps between being an emotional wreck, a jealous lover and a calm and collected psychopath. The main character, Satomi Rentaro, doesn\'t even have three ranges of emotion, he\'s either a bland self insert or an angry, sometimes bewildered, shounen protagonist and there is nothing in between the two.The art was nothing special, it was average at best and did nothing to try and  stand out in any way. The animation was decent enough, it stayed on model for most of the time and again didn\'t really stand out compared to any other action shounen. The action scenes themselves were pretty average, one shot firing gun, next shot exploding monsters and behind the monster as it gets sliced up, etcetera etcetera. The CG was below average, it looked plasticky and didn\'t fit into the overall visual look of the series. At least the CG wasn\'t as bad as KyoAni\'s dragon from the Chuunibyou movie, so they get points for that.The music was nothing special, standard fast paced actiony stuff, but it failed to make the action scenes any more enthralling (Pro tip: they weren\'t). The sound effects were nothing special, the guns sounded like the regular anime pop guns and so did the swords.In conclusion, I did not enjoy watching this series at all. All I could think about were the inconsistencies in the story, setting, characters and how many ""why didn\'t they ride the eagles into Mordor"" moments happening on my screen. If you want to watch an action shoot \'em up, there are a lot of other anime that are leagues better than Black Bullet ever hoped to be. At least the Yanagi Nagi end credits song was nice, unlike the rest of the series. kid with a loli by his side and a handgun shoved down the back of his pants better than thousands of trained soldiers?

Unlike in the Light Novel which focuses on Rentarou's emotion and the other characters the anime rushed this.-didn;t get to see any dem feels in the anime.I enjoyed it and wll still recommend the anime but personally still feel that the anime had a lot of room for improvements.-O "", 'Black Bullet. I went into this series with a bit of skepticism: Will this series, which seems to focus on human morals and values within the context of a war between the humans and ""them"", in which case, the Gastrea, achieve their message, loud and clear, in its measly 13 episodes of length? Much like previously released anime like Elfen Lied, Higurashi no naku koro ni, and Psycho Pass, that are well known for their darker settings that serve to illustrate a concept of humanity put to the test, Black Bullet incorporates a similar dark setting, with the apocalypse of the human race at stake,...and themes like segregation and the definition of justice, which, in theory, should bring out a creation that goes beyond just ""a tv series"", and becomes a work of literature.My skepticism was well-founded, however, and as I continued to watch the show, it continued to grow, along with my distaste for the show\'s repeated mishaps.Story: 3Black Bullet\'s story, while darker than your usual action-oriented plot, eventually devolves into just another shounen-resembling story that believes that ""any plot twist will make watchers drop their jaws in awe and instantly believe that it\'s an interesting and well-executed plotline."" Unfortunately, that fact isn\'t true, and whereas Black Bullet really tried to incorporate a complicated plot involving a little bit of politics, along with plenty of action and ""character building moments"", the sheer amount of predictable plot developments, along with contrived plot twists made the plot into something that didn\'t even really matter anymore - all that mattered in the end was watching the loli\'s fight the insects.Art: 7The art was one of the only parts of the anime that I enjoyed, and that isn\'t an understatement. It was appealing to watch the action take place - though some fights were a lot shorter than they could have been, the animation during those fights was fluid and sharp, and I could see most of the particles and special effects that really make a science-fiction oriented action scene worth watching. Studio Orange did a pretty good job, and while sometimes, the backgrounds didn\'t look as sharp or clear as they could have been, the majority of the more important features were well done, and I didn\'t really have any trouble differentiating between who was who or what was going on.Sound: 7The majority of the sound effects were fairly well handled - it never sounded too cluttered or too spread apart, and the opening and ending sequences were catchy. The opening really did remind me of Attack on Titan\'s first opening theme, and what with all the similarities between the two shows, I really can\'t say that it\'s just a coincidence, but I\'ll leave it at that...Character: 3One of the biggest issues this show had was the amount of fan-pandering it produced, solely off the characters that they chose utilize. Whereas a main character that can do anything and everything, taking bullet after bullet while pulling a Rambo to eventually take his enemies out is fun to watch, it doesn\'t really serve as a character - a living and breathing human being. In the case of Satomi Rentaro, it takes away his potential of being a main character people can relate to in order to empathically understand any overarching theme present in the series - which serves to make it harder to get it at all. In addition, the existence of superpowered loli half gastrea half human waifus 1. isn\'t explained and 2. isn\'t relevant to the plot except to provide the occasional joke or be the direct trigger for a sad emotional reaction when they die. The only interesting character was the masked man, only because his ideals are twisted, and not what you\'d usually see in a series, making him unique amongst a cast of cardboard cutouts and tropes you can find anywhere else.Enjoyment: 2There were way too many cases of Pilot\'s Love Song, in which they would introduce characters, simply to have them die to invoke emotional response from the audience, as well as Guilty Crown and Mirai Nikki type plot twists, both which I dread. Overall, the series felt very contrived, and upon closer inspection, much of the plot that is in between the spaces of the giant overarching story didn\'t make much sense, and weren\'t exciting or fun to watch. They tried a little too hard catering fanservice to the audience, when the series would have been fine without it, and probably would have been less distracting as well.Overall: 5All in all, I enjoyed this anime MUCH less than I expected to, considering it had all the pieces it needed to create a masterpiece that actually mattered and would influence what I thought about a certain value or moral, or would make me question ""what if I were in that situation, how would I react."" In the end, it turned out to be a lackluster show that simply had too many flaws and distracted too much from the main message for me to give it a higher rating, or even to say that ""wow, I learned something from this show"" or ""wow, this show really showed me something that I\'ve never wondered about before, maybe I should rethink it.""

Heck, the series didn\'t even let me enjoy my lolis, without having them die sporadically.', 'Black Bullet – an anime about lolis saving the world from the big bad monsters out to eat you alive. Or yet by a more literal way of saying it, they are actually young kids known as the Cursed Children with special abilities capable of fighting against Gastrea, the monsters that threatens humanity and its existence. Based off a light novel of the same name, shows like this has an incentive to go a variety of ways with this. The result? A mediocre bag of an adaptation clustered with mind bobbling antics.The premise initially sounds interesting, taking place in a futuristic setting in the year...of 2031 (ten years after humanity were beaten by the Gastrea ). Humanity lives behind walls of monolithic material for survival. To fight off the Gastrea, we get the cursed children playing the roles of “initiator” with a partner known as “promoter” in a sort of mentor/student relationship for combat units. Black Bullet tells the story of a young promoter named Rentaro Satomi and his roles against the Gastrea.Opening the doors to the BB world requires takes some enduring to get through. By all means, the show has a serious premise but saturated with generics. For instance, the story begins quickly enough to illustrate the grim reality of their world. Even the main male protagonist, Rentaro had a tragic past when he lost his parents. As for the cursed children themselves, none of them have a true loving family with a normal mother and father. Here though, we get Enju, a ten year old assigned to Rentaro as an Initiator. Tossing age differences aside, there is hardly anything we can compare about the two in terms of similarities besides their tragic past. Yet, this isn’t something we should entirely feel sympathetic about. After all, it is war and dangers are constant so losses shouldn’t be something to be surprised about. The other point is that the current relationship between Rentaro and Enju can be described as lively and charming. While on missions, they are focused but at home seems to be relaxed more than ever, at least for Enju anyways. And this is where the show drops the ball on its grim atmosphere. For one thing, Enju never ceases to throw herself at Rentaro all the while making suggestive poses, innuendos, and trying to have a relationship with him. It’s outright awkwardly executed and badly performed despite the initially promising premise. In retrospect, it spirals into a path of jokey nonsense like a flippant screwball.That’s just the opening stages though as Black Bullet likes to base its story with other characters all focused into the war against Gasetra. Although not a cursed child, we get the typical childhood friend Kisara who has known Rentaro since he was a kid. This sets forward the basis of a love triangle. But like the way the show goes, it’s hard take it seriously when her competition is a 10 year old. But besides that, Rentaro seems to actually show response to her advances. All while this is happening, Enju’s own plans are left useless. It’s like she really is cursed or something with little or no hope of a loving relationship with Rentaro. And if that would occur, it would be quite an uneasy relationship to deal with as Enju’s lack of common sense becomes a source of compromising exhibitions. The endgame is to not expect any romance development in this show as it neglects this phase. It just wouldn’t work with the show’s circumstances and potential death flags. However, do expect the usual clichés, uncanny jokes, and whirlwind of fan service.Even with all the mind bobbling gags going on, the show does have a solid style of delivering its grimmer side of its premise. The antagonists looks serious with their egos and intimidating personalities. The Gasetra rides off of fear and delivers this effectively with their menacing actions. For the government, it also seems their research and development is trying to do what it needs for the survival of humanity. On an even darker scale, there’s prejudice against Cursed Children in a similar way that gives off Elfen Lied-esque nostalgia. Indeed, society ostracizes cursed children and treats them like experiments and trash. The flashbacks between Rentaro and Enju shows this clearly during their first encounter that shows how fearful humanity is towards the Cursed Children. The logic here is that the Cursed Children has some of its blood pumping in their veins while results in their unfortunate discrimination. At the same time, death is real and the show paints this reality with gruesome exits for some of its characters. The result of this often involves bloodshed, limbs being destroyed, and lives eradicated simply because they are no longer human. The Cursed Children themselves even have malevolent-like features such as their scarlet eyes. It creates a sense of fear but what people don’t know is the true visage of some of its characters. Children, after all often lack common sense and people take advantage of them to implode their nature. Police brutality adapts this concept into play resulting in very ghastly consequences. The point is, the show does keep promise with what it sticks to – the dark story in a world with Gastrea and cursed lolis.While all the antagonists are cunningly designed that are convincing, their purpose and motivations lacks any sort of interest. We get dangerous promoters such as Kagetane that kills others as a way to steam up interest as a villain. But really, his character lacks any sort of insight of development. It’s stereotypical even by his design such as his psychopathic gestures and shadowy mask. And because the Gastrea are literally mindless, don’t expect any sort of characterization from any of them, not even from database standards besides for just what they are. As for other antagonists, they are cliché including corrupt individuals and predictable outcomes just based on what they are from the surface. One dimensional and desperate is how the show tries to increase interests towards viewers but ultimately results in a cheesy set up molded like a lazy piece of work.And while the show deals with many complicated concepts, the characters follows a surprisingly pragmatic and idealistic approach. For instance Rentaro fights like it’s he is doing it for the rights of humanity rather than what he thinks personally. Judgment is left stranded in a fog as characters follows a path of experimental ways of dealing with threats. Their primary motivation is survival and the result. That’s what it really manners in the end. Long story short: the show suffers from development between characters as result of this approach. And even though certain characters does live, developments feels goofy, childish, and occasionally gives off the wrong message leading to compromising positions. Not to mention, Rentaro somehow stirs up multiple interests of the opposite sex throughout the show where it almost enters a harem-like concept. But really though, the how creates a multitude layer of bizarre balance when it comes to its execution. Sometimes, it follows its story strictly while other times goofs off with its badly executed comedy. The story itself also suffers from adaptation as certain arcs have way too many things happening all at once. While this is not entirely surprising as result of LN adaptations, some resolutions are far too abrupt that will leave questions into viewers’ minds. It’s just too damn rushed.Artwork is standard on most parts although visually wise, most of it is impressive based on its setting. The OP and ED songs has a dreamlike atmosphere to its backgrounds while the sequences balances decent amount of imagery. There’s certain parts of the show that can remind people of Attack on Titan despite the contrasting settings. But character designs wise, the Cursed Children can come as a mixed bag. They come as more of the package with adorableness and badass. Do take emphasis on their scarlet eyes though as the show takes a special interest to clearly identify them with their roles. On other hand, Gastera’ mutation sequences are gruesome to the core with their gimmick. They take on various forms but all of them shows the same brutality. Otherwise, most of the other character designs are moderate enough whether it’s Rentaro’s well-trained figure or Kisara’s spaghetti hair. The fan service is there though with it even being openly addressed on many occasions. You can thank the lack of common sense for that. Don’t blame the Cursed Children. Blame common sense.Surprisingly though, the soundtrack is one of the more dynamic strengths of the show. As a technical feature, it is quite impressive during action sequences when it intensely draws out its delivery. Characters such as the Cursed Children also balances their voice tones to demonstrate their loneliness and sorrow. Even Enju, despite her cherry self, shows this side of her when she feels antagonized. And while dialogues feels stale and cheesy, the humor behind them is to the point without any sort of mystery. We also get emotional appeal with its musical scores. Beyond that, the OP and ED songs shows a melancholy that is spiritually gripping.It’s not mindless entertainment when taking Black Bullet’s story for granted. But most times, this show borders on into a field of absentmindedness. It just feels like the show has this engaging premise but not entirely sure what to do with it. With its rushed story also brings a cast of cute girls with scarlet’s eyes doing government’s work. However, I do give some credit to the technical field especially when it comes to soundtrack. The experience of that is enticing with something to write home about. Yet ultimately when it comes down to it, this show is not too much different than junk food. When you eat it, you might just forget how it tastes like afterwards. of 2031 (ten years after humanity were beaten by the Gastrea ). Humanity lives behind walls of monolithic material for survival.

While on missions, they are focused but at home seems to be relaxed more than ever, at least for Enju anyways. And this is where the show drops the ball on its grim atmosphere. For one thing, Enju never ceases to throw herself at Rentaro all the while making suggestive poses, innuendos, and trying to have a relationship with him. It’s outright awkwardly executed and badly performed despite the initially promising premise. In retrospect, it spirals into a path of jokey nonsense like a flippant screwball.That’s just the opening stages though as Black Bullet likes to base its story with other characters all focused into the war against Gasetra. Although not a cursed child, we get the typical childhood friend Kisara who has known Rentaro since he was a kid. This sets forward the basis of a love triangle. But like the way the show goes, it’s hard take it seriously when her competition is a 10 year old. But besides that, Rentaro seems to actually show response to her advances. All while this is happening, Enju’s own plans are left useless. It’s like she really is cursed or something with little or no hope of a loving relationship with Rentaro. And if that would occur, it would be quite an uneasy relationship to deal with as Enju’s lack of common sense becomes a source of compromising exhibitions. The endgame is to not expect any romance development in this show as it neglects this phase. It just wouldn’t work with the show’s circumstances and potential death flags. However, do expect the usual clichés, uncanny jokes, and whirlwind of fan service.Even with all the mind bobbling gags going on, the show does have a solid style of delivering its grimmer side of its premise. The antagonists looks serious with their egos and intimidating personalities. The Gasetra rides off of fear and delivers this effectively with their menacing actions. For the government, it also seems their research and development is trying to do what it needs for the survival of humanity. On an even darker scale, there’s prejudice against Cursed Children in a similar way that gives off Elfen Lied-esque nostalgia. Indeed, society ostracizes cursed children and treats them like experiments and trash. The flashbacks between Rentaro and Enju shows this clearly during their first encounter that shows how fearful humanity is towards the Cursed Children. The logic here is that the Cursed Children has some of its blood pumping in their veins while results in their unfortunate discrimination. At the same time, death is real and the show paints this reality with gruesome exits for some of its characters. The result of this often involves bloodshed, limbs being destroyed, and lives eradicated simply because they are no longer human. The Cursed Children themselves even have malevolent-like features such as their scarlet eyes. It creates a sense of fear but what people don’t know is the true visage of some of its characters. Children, after all often lack common sense and people take advantage of them to implode their nature. Police brutality adapts this concept into play resulting in very ghastly consequences. The point is, the show does keep promise with what it sticks to – the dark story in a world with Gastrea and cursed lolis.While all the antagonists are cunningly designed that are convincing, their purpose and motivations lacks any sort of interest. We get dangerous promoters such as Kagetane that kills others as a way to steam up interest as a villain. But really, his character lacks any sort of insight of development. It’s stereotypical even by his design such as his psychopathic gestures and shadowy mask. And because the Gastrea are literally mindless, don’t expect any sort of characterization from any of them, not even from database standards besides for just what they are. As for other antagonists, they are cliché including corrupt individuals and predictable outcomes just based on what they are from the surface. One dimensional and desperate is how the show tries to increase interests towards viewers but ultimately results in a cheesy set up molded like a lazy piece of work.And while the show deals with many complicated concepts, the characters follows a surprisingly pragmatic and idealistic approach. For instance Rentaro fights like it’s he is doing it for the rights of humanity rather than what he thinks personally. Judgment is left stranded in a fog as characters follows a path of experimental ways of dealing with threats. Their primary motivation is survival and the result. That’s what it really manners in the end. Long story short: the show suffers from development between characters as result of this approach. And even though certain characters does live, developments feels goofy, childish, and occasionally gives off the wrong message leading to compromising positions. Not to mention, Rentaro somehow stirs up multiple interests of the opposite sex throughout the show where it almost enters a harem-like concept. But really though, the how creates a multitude layer of bizarre balance when it comes to its execution. Sometimes, it follows its story strictly while other times goofs off with its badly executed comedy. The story itself also suffers from adaptation as certain arcs have way too many things happening all at once. While this is not entirely surprising as result of LN adaptations, some resolutions are far too abrupt that will leave questions into viewers’ minds. It’s just too damn rushed.Artwork is standard on most parts although visually wise, most of it is impressive based on its setting. The OP and ED songs has a dreamlike atmosphere to its backgrounds while the sequences balances decent amount of imagery. There’s certain parts of the show that can remind people of Attack on Titan despite the contrasting settings. But character designs wise, the Cursed Children can come as a mixed bag. They come as more of the package with adorableness and badass. Do take emphasis on their scarlet eyes though as the show takes a special interest to clearly identify them with their roles. On other hand, Gastera’ mutation sequences are gruesome to the core with their gimmick. They take on various forms but all of them shows the same brutality. Otherwise, most of the other character designs are moderate enough whether it’s Rentaro’s well-trained figure or Kisara’s spaghetti hair. The fan service is there though with it even being openly addressed on many occasions. You can thank the lack of common sense for that. Don’t blame the Cursed Children. Blame common sense.Surprisingly though, the soundtrack is one of the more dynamic strengths of the show. As a technical feature, it is quite impressive during action sequences when it intensely draws out its delivery. Characters such as the Cursed Children also balances their voice tones to demonstrate their loneliness and sorrow. Even Enju, despite her cherry self, shows this side of her when she feels antagonized. And while dialogues feels stale and cheesy, the humor behind them is to the point without any sort of mystery. We also get emotional appeal with its musical scores. Beyond that, the OP and ED songs shows a melancholy that is spiritually gripping.It’s not mindless entertainment when taking Black Bullet’s story for granted. But most times, this show borders on into a field of absentmindedness. It just feels like the show has this engaging premise but not entirely sure what to do with it. With its rushed story also brings a cast of cute girls with scarlet’s eyes doing government’s work. However, I do give some credit to the technical field especially when it comes to soundtrack. The experience of that is enticing with something to write home about. Yet ultimately when it comes down to it, this show is not too much different than junk food. When you eat it, you might just forget how it tastes like afterwards.', ""First: If you're searching for Loli or anything else to feed your fantasies, this is not for you. Contrary to other reviews who claim this to be your typical loli-fest, it is not. What it is, is a group of little girls who act like little girls, not little tramps, they have childish ambitions of MARRYING the main character; not having sex with him.The other reviews already sum up the story in detail so I'll just sum it up.Fighters of all kinds (swords, guns, fists, ect) have a partner called a 'cursed child' these children vary in abilities just as the fighters do. Their duty...is wipe out parasites, doing so grants them a higher ranking.Typical anime stuff> Big parasite attacks a tower keeping them out, leading to an all out war against them.Typical really strong antagonist>Typical OP protagonist>Worth a watch, but nothing to drool over or rant about. is wipe out parasites, doing so grants them a higher ranking.Typical anime stuff> Big parasite attacks a tower keeping them out, leading to an all out war against them.Typical really strong antagonist>Typical OP protagonist>Worth a watch, but nothing to drool over or rant about."", 'Right!This is my first review here so please spare me internet while I add to the huge ocean of random stuff!Black Bullet was a show that I picked up after watching Guilty Crown and its fair to say if you liked that you\'ll like this. I hasten to add I would never claim Guilty Crown is good, but it is fun, and we all like to have fun do we not?So was Black Bullet fun or a disaster? Lets see!Story-3My impression of Black Bullets story was of a director trying too hard. Calling someone a Try-hard should not be taken as an insult however....The plot seemed to be trying to fit in every dramatic plot twist from every other show ever in a 13 episode series. Action! School Drama! Love triangles (or more like a hexagon or dodecagon if you\'re fussy)! Revenge! Apocalypse! Robots! Zombies! Politics! Persecution! Loli! Look how cute the Loli are!Loli!The story was in general quite a mess with supposedly dramatic events being thrown at the screen and never explained. My favorite being the tricycle from episode 4 which was never explained. However it did set up some impressively epic events which I enjoyed the scope of so its not a total loss.In short most of humanity is dead, and trapped within cities surrounded by giant monoliths, built to keep the mysterious monsters created by the Gastrea virus out of the city. The best weapon humanity has are the Cursed Children, children born from mothers infected by the Gastrea and born super strong and intelligent and guided by promoters, similarly talented adults.In shorter, sounds pretty cool.Art-7It looked pretty good.Wait I need to write more?Okay compared to most stuff coming out this year it compared fairly well. There were some very noticeable sudden drops in quality and the CGI for the Gastrea was awful.The colour palate was quite varied and the character design fairly solid with the lolis especially getting a lot of attention. And (I flinch as I say this) they were drawn adorably at times. I swear half their art budget went on making those work.Sound-9Actually somewhere where the show shone. The OP and ED were both pretty solid with the OP being maybe my favorite of the season. The animation for the OP however was pretty poor using mostly frames taken from the show and the first version being much better synched with the music. The ED was done significantly better in that regard. I did feel the OP borrowed slightly from AoT\'s but hey that was a good OP.The background music was also pretty good.I especially enjoyed the jazz theme that played with Tina Sprout and Enju\'s theme also.I don\'t speak Japanese but the voice acting seemed good as well. They had a couple of my favorite VA\'s including Yui Horie (Hanekawa, Kouko and Minori) and Yuki Kaji (Eren from AoT and Shu from Guilty Crown).Characters-3Characters really suffered in this show. most received essentially no development and there were a significant number a times where I was being shown an emotional scene and just thinking ""I don\'t care"". The bare levels of characterization that were set down were at times simply ignored and, even worse, sometimes brought back an instant later like nothing had happened. Again more time to actually show the journey the characters made would\'ve been nice.As I might have alluded to previously a biggest problem I had with the show was the Loli aspect. I object to the idea of Loli in general but that\'s fine. Why else do you watch anime except for something a bit different? Loli can be done well (see bakemonogatari) and it can be funny and adorable. However the sheer number of Loli characters all wanting to get boned by an 20 year old... nope. Not cool.The leads were not entirely terrible. The Lead Lead Rentaro (definitely a phrase) was actually very solid being a step beyond the typical harem -insert your name here- character and actually showed quite a degree of compassion and awareness of the girls around him. He was a typical badass with a bit of filling. Enju, Rentaro\'s partner, was also fairly solid at times balancing the frailty of a young child thrown into a brutal situation quite well with sudden ability to bounce back typical of a child. And unlike the rest she did at least have a reason to love the main character. But as mentioned before important events seem to just disappear in characters minds rather than scaring them for life. I\'m evil I enjoy that stuff.Enjoyment-8Despite all I\'ve said I really quite enjoyed this show. There was a fairly equal balance between ""This is awesome"" and ""This is stupid"" moments but the awesome was fairly awesome and the stupid was so stupid it was kinda fun.However I would not recommend this unless you have pretty good stupidity filters. The change from solemn coolness to forced romance Loli loving can be very jarring.Overall-5Mal says it all. Mediocre.Its not rubbish (well maybe it is) and its certainly not great. However it is fun and I would say if you have a rainy day and nothing else you particularly want to watch then this will fill a gap.

Though instead of titans you have these huge bug like creatures called Gastrea, and its set in the future in Japan rather than an older style civilization. However the biggest difference between the 2 shows is that Attack on Titan is actually very good, where as this is just...eh.Story (6)The story as I mentioned before is, on paper, pretty similar to Attack on Titan. Humanity at the brink of extinction. Huge monsters that killed someone in the protagonist\'s family. A city inside of a barrier. But that\'s...mainly where most of the blatant similarities stop. The main character, Rentaro is apparently half robot as well...also there\'s these lolis that are infected by the Gastrea or something and they like partner up with people like Rentaro and fight because now they have powers?...Also there\'s this villain that kinda fucks around inside the barrier and there\'s also other places other than Japan or something?I don\'t know, the plot of this show I feel jumps around waaay to much and there\'s just too much going on at once, not the mention the pacing is basically terrible. There\'s a climatic episode like halfway through the season and it just really feels out of place and weird. I feel like the story lacked a lot of focus. The Gastrea were interesting but you hardly ever even see them until later on. They come off as barely having to do with the plot. Where as, with Attack on Titan, you\'re always reminded of them, and they are shown quite often. Hell, even the name of the show has barely anything to do with it. Rentaro shot his gun with ""black bullets"" like once in the whole show and that was in the first episode. Same with the whole him being a robot, I even forgot about that later on. I feel like there was a lot of lack of focus and proper pacing here.Not to mention, there\'s a lot of brutal deaths is this show, mainly of little girls which I find very disturbing. I guess its not automatically a bad thing but I feel like every death, especially of little girls just felt very sudden and uncalled for. A lot of them where just forgotten quickly after so it didn\'t even feel like that really mattered.Overall, it got more interesting by the end, but even the last episode had some pacing issues if you ask me.Art (7)The art is good. Not much to say here. Weird CGI that seems somewhat out of place but that\'s how most CGI is.Sound (8)The music and voice acting is over all pretty solid. The voice actor of Eren from Attack on Titan also voices Rentaro, and he does a pretty good job. The opening is very good as well as the ending, (though halfway through they changed the opening while keeping the song and the new opening wasn\'t quite as good). I\'m also a fan of a lot of the background music as well.Characters (6)The characters are fine I guess. My favorite would have to be the villain, though he\'s not shown that often after the first few episodes. Nobody else really stood out to me though.Enjoyment (6)I never really felt like watching this show most of the time and I just kind of forced myself to watch it when it came on just because I wanted to finish it. It had it\'s moments but over all its probably my least favorite show I watched this season.Overall (6)It\'s alright and has it\'s moments, but there\'s really nothing that great here in terms of story in my opinion. If it really sounds like something you\'d like, I\'d say give it a shot, otherwise, I\'d say just skip it. mainly where most of the blatant similarities stop.

Although it may not seem like the most popular anime, it\'s hype back in spring was pretty big, and I\'ve seen reviews rating Black Bullet over an 8, which left me speechless. Black Bullet had a promising start sort of, but quickly it\'s plot just died away with no explanation of what\'s happening, my favorite character in the anime disappeared for half the show and the ending was plain rushed and made absolutely no sense.The plot was ""eh""; it was a mixture of Guilty Crown and Attack on Titans, which...seems amazing, but that was not the case. There are these monsters called Gastrea, that infect humans turning humans into monsters. Humanity is on the brink of extinction until they find Vibranium, the stuff dreams are made of… or nightmares when it comes to the Gastrea. Having found the Gastrea\'s kyptonite, humans have created walls/barriers and have created haven cities where they could live in peace. Outside these barriers were the cursed children, humans that were part Gastrea (monster). In this world of turmoil, Rentaro witnesses all the ugliness in it. Unfortunately for the human race the Gastrea have managed to break into the city somehow, and it\'s up to the main character Rentarou and his teammate Enju to save the day. And... that\'s it, the ending ends in a makes absolutely no sense cliffhanger and blah blah blah blah. The few characters and animation were the only bright spots in this anime. Enju and the other cursed children was a new interesting add, and the main protagonist was pretty badass which was nice, but then in the end he suddenly loses all his ""badassness"". Anyways overall the plot just gets worse and worse as it progresses, that\'s really all I have to say. The anime is kind of enjoyable hence the 5 ""average"" rating, but seriously I wouldn\'t recommend this to people looking for a ""good"" anime. seems amazing, but that was not the case.

A common combination of genres, isn't it?Black Bullet is an adaptation of its still ongoing Light Novel,  was announced last year, 2013. Then became a long-awaited series of 2014.Although, the main idea isn't too impressive or original if we want to put it like that, the plot has much more in store. To be precise, the story is rather fast-paced. It is basically some short stories put together into 13 episodes. And even though it's true that there was some sort of bridge between two 'short stories', it is very obvious that the staff just wanted too many elements in the...same place. Luckily, this doesn't spoil the whole atmosphere as a whole.There were many truly good closing scenes which are suggestive and aditive to its genre. The thing is that many of these 'floating ideas' could as well have been used. But, they weren't. Most of them were left unexploted and to be straightforward, I'm pretty sure that using these ideas instead could have made a 20% better story.With these said, however, there is one thing that I especially liked about the plot. That is the discussion of rarely mentioned and taught issues like discrimination, human inhospitality and cruelty. This little addition just made the everything twice as dramatic as it would otherwise be.The art of Black Bullet was at times breath-taking but in other cases it was rather mehish. But, whichever is the case, the art, without a doubt, matches the story and contributes well to the mood of it. The best example for this would be the openings; as they indeed served as a good 'programme guide'. They showed what you should expect of the series and determined the attribute of the characters, too.The characters sometimes tended to prove themselves amazingly unnecessary. To me some of them seemed to be introduced because the other person who, simply put, had exactly the same traits won't turn up again.Also, everybody's lives revolve around the protagonist's. The main of all characters, Rentaro Satomi in this universe is a god. And this actually is true from the first to the last word. Not only is he incredibly strong but he's also drop-dead gorgeos, has his harem of little girls and has two teen girls with respectable size of chest love him. But he's lacking one thing; common sense. This is what, in fact, refers to all of the charcters. By this, I mean that when an unforeseen event occurs nobody seems to pose questions like 'why?', 'how?' or just the most obvios one 'what?!'.Another problem is character development. As a matter of fact, there isn't any. Well, there is but it is so short-term. People go through very sad and tear jerking event, these scenes were done brilliant, to be honest, and they are emotionally shaken.. For an episode. Then in the next episode they are as happy as ever. Unfortunatelly, this is also applicable to peronalities and behaviour displayed towards other characters. Just change overnight.This is so exposed to the viewers that this just ruins the characters.The very best reason I would recommend this anime for is the soundtracks. They are unbelievably catchy and something that remains on your mind for like a week. They match the particular scenes they are in.While there are many components that resemble things from real-life, many just really go in the face of nature.There are tons of hilarious moments which are worth re-watched. It's rather sad to say; that is all that increases the value of re-watching.I believe that many good words could be said about Black Bullet but liking (or not liking) it comes down to the viewers only.

If you\'ve seen Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin), you\'ll notice that the opening music, art (and world-concept in general) are kind of really similar. I won\'t say it\'s a copy, you decide that for yourself. The opening was in my opinion not really fitting, that\'s all.Anyway, to get to the story line. I gave it a 6/10, because the story wasn\'t boring or tiring, it just wasn\'t really original. I realize that, in some dose, the creators gave thought into it, but everything was rushed to the limit where the timing became ridiculous. To cut it short, too...much content was packed into a small number of episodes.Characters were... well, okay. (6/10) They were too specific though, with clear behavioral patterns and only slight character development. No one actually surprised me. In the end there\'s, I suppose, some sort of cliffhanger, which was shortly after ruined, because the main character had to say something irrelevant about it. Let\'s say that everything is too obvious, and that\'s why the characters are just ""okay"".Moving on to enjoyment... it was good. I can\'t say that I didn\'t enjoy it. It didn\'t amaze me, but it\'s one of those random anime which bring up some feelings, even though you don\'t really bind with the characters. It\'s too bad that everything is rushed. I suppose I would have enjoyed it more if it was a 24-episode anime with slowed down plot and more (also better) character development.I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend it, but if you like little cute girls with superpowers... watch it. much content was packed into a small number of episodes.Characters were... well, okay.

Soon, they\'ll have finished the greatest novel known to man."" A quote from The Simpsons has never been so accurate, except that the monkeys didn´t end up writing a novel, they ended up writing the script for an anime adaptation. Oh, you don´t believe me do you?Well, that´s what reviews are for, to convince people that the series you are reviewing is either good or bad.So with no further ado, this is The Neko and I welcome you to my review of the show, Black Bullet.The premise of the show is quite simple, is the...usual ""humanity´s last stand"" kind of plot, but I´don´t really care for originality as long as the story is well done. Is it well done? Well, look at the number on the side of this review, does it seem like I think it´s well done? If the answer is yes then you need to check your eyesight, ´cause if you can´t see the number then I´m really worried about you.The thing about Black Bullet´s plot is that it tries to be ""dark"" and ""serious"" but also tries several times to have comedy and fanservice with lolis, because someone thought that having a lot of lolis in a ""dark"" and ""serious"" show was a great idea, and it has been proven before that trying to mix these two opposites just like that, doesn´t work, I cannot take something seriously like that. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. This series also has, like I said before a little problem with the script, and by little I mean a BIG problem with the script. You see, when you actually listen to the kind of things the characters say, sometimes you might think ""Boy, that line was really stupid"", because sometimes the things they say doesn´t have any logic on then, like there´s is no way that the kind of things these characters say, would be said by an actual and sane person. For example, all you need for a villain in this series to spit up all his plans, is just a simple question from our main protagonist, Rentaro. I can´t really put the stupidity in the script into words, it´s something that you have to experiment to understand, but for doing that, you have to watch the show, which I do not recommend. But this is not all, oh no no no no no. The other thing that this series has is plot holes, yep, as if it weren´t enough with the shitty script. For example in the first episode we see everyone in some kind of refugee camp being attack by the Gastrea, the monsters that are attacking Tokio this time, the scene afterwards everyone is safe and happy behind the Varanium walls, the Gastrea´s elemental weakness, but we don´t know how did that happened, how did they pass from ""total destruction"" to discovering that Varanium is super effective against Gastreas and having the time to build the Varanium structures?. And this is just ONE plot hole, because you can pretty much take a random episode and find them by dozens. The show also likes to make use of Deus ex-Machinas, I counted four in total, if someone has counted more, let me know and you will win an imaginary hug. How cool is that? It also has a terrible pacing, too rushed at the begging, too slow by the end. So this series pretty much makes every mistake it can do. You could say that I should turn my brain of and enjoy the series, but is my belief that if a show wants me to take it seriously, and believe me this series is desperate to prove that I should, I should have my brain in the on-mode. Also from episode 8 and forward the show losses any sense of action, and has also this thing for increasing it´s problems from episode to episode.The artwork was pretty much above average for me. I really like the colour palette that they used in this show, it makes it look nice, but the animation itself has some drops here and there, where the framerate really goes down, it is pretty noticeable. But the worst part, is that later on the series they start to use CGI to animate the Gastreas, and it looks so bad, It´s like I could get eye cancer just from looking at them, it´s awful. Some character designs are  kinda good, except for Rentaro who is just a normal guy with a suit, Kisara who is the chick that uses a school uniform 24/7, and some of the lolis because in this show lolis have to belong to some kid of archetype and they dress as such, for example the Samurai Stereotype Loli will dress with, you guessed it, samurai clothes. About the designs that I like, they belong to either a secondary character that we don´t see too often anyway, or to Kagetane Hiruko the ""main"" villain, who actually seems creepy but elegant, just like a villain should look. The backgrounds are nothing out of this world but they are ok, nothing really AMAZING, but ok.The soundtrack though, that´s the best part of the series, which is actually kinda sad if you think about it. It mostly uses the techno music that anime likes to use so much this days, but it´s pretty kickass when there´s a Gastrea on the scene, but when there´s is not any Gastrea or any threat of any kind to our protagonists and the series flips to it´s more light-hearted side it becomes pretty forgettable, but when is good, IS GOOOD. On the voice acting side of the things, voices ranged from character to character, for example, Rentaro´s voice is done by Yuki Kaji the same guy who did the voice for Eren Jaeger fron Attack on Ti... damn it I really wanted to finish the review without mentioning Attack on Titan, there goes my record. Anyway his voice acting is pretty solid, too bad that he doesn´t have any actual good lines to say. The voice from the main villain Hiruko Kagetane is also masterfully done by Rikiya Koyama who also did the voices for Takamura from Hajime no Ippo and Emiya from Fate/Zero, need I say more?On the other hand we also have a secondary character, Shouma, whose voice actor, Shinichiro Miki, didn´t do the best of the job for this character in particular.This show has only one OP and ED, the only noteworthy being the opening. It´s a fripSide theme, so if you are a fan of their style of music you will probably like this one, and no, I will not talk about the ""similar to AoT"" chorus at the beginning of the song. The thing about the OP though, is that someone had the bright idea to change the animation of the OP for a more spoilerific version, and not only it doesn´t look as good as the original, it spoils LOTS of stuff, not that is really important since this is a kinda predictable show anyway.As I said the soundtrack was actually the best part of the series, so that kind of gives you an idea of what I think of the characters, doesn´t it?I will focus mainly in the main four, Rentaro, Kisara, Enju and the ""main"" villain Kagetane.Rentaro is pretty much your typical shounen protagonist, which wouldn´t be that much of a problem is this show wasn´t a SEINEN. What is a cliché battle shonen protagonist doing in a Seinen? Fuck if I know. But he is pretty much a walking cliché, he yells the name of every attack he throws, and he has some longass names in his sleeves, he practices some kind of martial art, he is the ""good"" guy, he can do no wrong, that´s Rentaro, and the only sense of development that this series has for him, is having him suddenly become a Gary Stu from episode 4, and that will be all the development for the rest of the series, you won´t find anymore of that here, plus Rentaro can be pretty stupid, and as such he is annoying and unlikeable.Kisara is mainly the romantic subplot, because this show needed that too, and is not exactly the best romantic subplot . Kisara is a Tsundere, and the only development she gets is, hear this, becoming a yandere in the last episode ¡Yay!Apart from that, and because of the fact that this show has a Gary Stu, they don´t really focus on her, and she doesn´t have that much screentime either, plus she is useless most of the time, so she is only there for the romantic subplot, great.Enju is the ""main"" loli of the series and she pretty much embodies the archetype of the pervert loli, and is also the other romantic subplot, but this time for the lolicons. The thing that bothers me most about Enju is that even when her friends die RIGHT in front of her, no matter how many people discriminate her for being a ""Cursed Children"", no matter what problems may faze her, she just cries some minutes and then by the next episode she is the same exact pervert loli that she has always been. Really doesn´t she have some kind of trauma from all of that? ¡She is a freaking 10 year old! She should have some kind of trauma, or at least be depressed for days after that.And then we have Kagetane, the ""main"" villain. If you were sharp enough you probably notice how I always write the word ""main"" between quotes, this is because in the case of Enju, the show just focus on her at the beginning, and then focus more on Rentaro since he is the Stu, but in the case of Kagetane I call him ""main"" villain because he is actually absent for most of the series, he has great presence at the beginning, then he disappears in episode 4, and reappears in episode 11, except that when he reappears he is not the villain anymore, he becomes another supporting character, and the show, again, chooses to focus more on Rentaro, which is sad because Kagetane was the only decent character, the only one with the decent dialogues, and he was a pretty decent villain, but that couldn´t last, not in this series. Something decent here? You might as well go look for a hentai that doesn´t show any boobs, it would be easier than finding something decent whether it´s in the story or the characters. In the meantime when Kagetane is not around they replace him with what I like to call ""Discount Villains"", which are by the way the worst characters in this series, which is actually quite a feat.The secondary characters in this series serve only one real purpose, TO DIE. If a secondary character doesn´t die then he is around doing nothing, and they don´t have any screen time, and as such I can´t really get to like them. Many of the secondary characters are lolis actually, and this show often kills them just for shock value, because in terms of personality each and every one of them fits into one specific archetype, whether it is the Samurai Loli, the Nekomimi Loli, the Shy loli, the Imouto Loli, you name it.So this shows follows something called the Theory of Moe Loli Replacement® (I am not the owner of this theory, all the rights belong to it´s respectful owner), in regards of the secondary loli characters. The Theory states that every time a loli dies in the series, she gets replaced by another one even more Moe in the next episode. This shows that this series only kills characters for shock value and as such, every character death, as everything in this series, is poorly executed.Reading all this things must have made you think that I didn´t enjoy this show at all, doesn´t it?As a matter of fact I did enjoy this show, but not for the reasons that it´s creators intended. The thing is that is show is in the category of ""so bad that it is actually good"", is just fun to see all the poor death executions, all the shitty dialogue, all the cliché characters, pointing them out and then laugh, A LOT. But as a show that tries to entertain for it´s story and characters it fails, horribly.Final Judgement:Black Bullet is a show that failed at everything it tried, becoming rather funny at how someone actually thought about making all of this. It´s story tries to be ""dark"" and ""serious"", but is just dumb and full of plot holes, Deus Ex-Machinas, comedy and even loli fanservice, ´cause why the fuck not? So it cannot be taken seriously, it´s characters have no real development and, except for Kagetane, they were all either unlikeable or the show didn´t have any focus on them, and Kagetane, the only decent character, is absent for most of the series.Anything that this series has that is actually decent, in regards of story and characters, just gets screwed sooner or later, a show that is only recommended for those looking for a show that´s in the ""so bad that it´s good"" level.This has been The Neko and I hope you have a pleasant day. usual ""humanity´s last stand"" kind of plot, but I´don´t really care for originality as long as the story is well done. Is it well done? Well, look at the number on the side of this review, does it seem like I think it´s well done? If the answer is yes then you need to check your eyesight, ´cause if you can´t see the number then I´m really worried about you.The thing about Black Bullet´s plot is that it tries to be ""dark"" and ""serious"" but also tries several times to have comedy and fanservice with lolis, because someone thought that having a lot of lolis in a ""dark"" and ""serious"" show was a great idea, and it has been proven before that trying to mix these two opposites just like that, doesn´t work, I cannot take something seriously like that.

As the shingeki have finished airing, the emergence of black bullet is surely gives a lot of viewer have a great expectation on this anime. Some sites says this anime is a successor of shingeki. But does it really true? I would say not.Black bullet is an anime that been package with thriller action and dark themes. The story is about when humanity was in the near extinct and living in...small territory because monsters or parasites called Gastrea. Gastrea is not only killed people but also infected people, the people who have been attacked by gastrea have a high probability become one of them and so, humanity must struggle with that monster.As the summary tells, it sounded awesome. Beforehand, Black bullet itself is an adaptation from light novel which people usually tends to have a great expectation since light novel is usually have more details in telling the story. But it wasnt happen, the story has  plotholes and moreover feel rushed. 13 Episodes is doesnt enough to cover the story. As the story with thriller feeling, how the story progress is one of the key to make viewers feel the atmosphere. But in the end,  it felt like the story drags the viewers to follow their fast paced story without telling what happen on that scene in detail and leaves a big question.Well, the story is not always serious, they have some cute and funny things to lighten up this story. Well, its not weird since Shiden Kanzaki previous work is romance comedy. The jokes that happen is pretty funny but since the anime themes is struggling and despair, the joke feels like out of the place.  For your info, the MC aka Rentarou have a pair named Enju which is loli. Some lovey-dovey things that happen is a little bit annoying. Why do we need to see a lovey dovey when we know that we’re struggling with monsters. There isnt any coherence when this anime talks about humanity in the edge but they put some lovey-dovey jokes.Aside from the story, the art in this anime is quite “normal” for some action anime. When there is a battle, the effect is quite good, not so sparkly and they keep it as not too excessive. The background is quite detailed for an action anime and one thing to notice is how the art is suitable with the themes with the anime, the coloring in this anime is quite dark and blur which makes the despair and fear feels intensively being felt.Other things to notice in this art is how the design of each characters.  Sometimes the characters design isnt consistent. When watching this, i cant help to notice that in every scenes they draw the characters so badly like how Kisara’s boobs shape, its quite weird and really bothering. Its  something that doesn’t bode too well for an action/fantasy series such as this. In the end, there isnt something to being prominent except how the coloring that really brings the feel of this anime.Our main protagonist in this anime is Kentaro and Enju, they’re always being considered as a couple though its just a claim from Enju not from the both sides. Kentaro as the main character in this anime is like the other main character which is have a justice feeling and would help anyone, He also has a kind heart, calm demeanor, and comes across as brother type as what he does to Enju. Enju, in the other hand is like young sister type, differ from Kentaro, Enju see Kentaro as her couple and do what she can to get an attention. Actually this is quite interesting too see the relationship between them throughout the series. They way how they interact with each others is quite enjoyable.If there are things that awesome from this anime, it was their sound. From, the opening song this anime have Fripside with their song “Black Bullet”. This song is tremendous, the gospel in this song is really enchanting and gives me a goosebumps, its quite epic song and one of the best opening song in spring 2014. Aside from the opening song, the soundtrack is great too. Its no wonder since its been arranged by Sagisu Shirou who is responsible for Evangelion, Berserk, and Magi. This time, he also made it with his music in this anime.  Its increasing the intensity feeling and quite catchy. But sadly, sometimes this soundtrack song is overly used and repetitive. It makes the song losing its taste and being plain.Beside the soundtrack, the seiyuu also what makes this anime more better with their voice. We got Kaji Yuki known for his voice as Eren Jaeger and also Yui Horie who known as singer and seiyuu for Hanekawa Tsubasa in Monogatari seriesIn the end, this anime is not what are people expected, if we’re talking about quality its just so far from Shingeki which people tends to relate this anime and of course, not all people would dislike it, some people would find this anime is interesting. This anime is good in some way and people who likes tragedy, dark themes and loli, this anime would be a great show for you. small territory because monsters or parasites called Gastrea. Gastrea is not only killed people but also infected people, the people who have been attacked by gastrea have a high probability become one of them and so, humanity must struggle with that monster.As the summary tells, it sounded awesome.

This song is tremendous, the gospel in this song is really enchanting and gives me a goosebumps, its quite epic song and one of the best opening song in spring 2014. Aside from the opening song, the soundtrack is great too. Its no wonder since its been arranged by Sagisu Shirou who is responsible for Evangelion, Berserk, and Magi. This time, he also made it with his music in this anime.  Its increasing the intensity feeling and quite catchy. But sadly, sometimes this soundtrack song is overly used and repetitive. It makes the song losing its taste and being plain.Beside the soundtrack, the seiyuu also what makes this anime more better with their voice. We got Kaji Yuki known for his voice as Eren Jaeger and also Yui Horie who known as singer and seiyuu for Hanekawa Tsubasa in Monogatari seriesIn the end, this anime is not what are people expected, if we’re talking about quality its just so far from Shingeki which people tends to relate this anime and of course, not all people would dislike it, some people would find this anime is interesting. This anime is good in some way and people who likes tragedy, dark themes and loli, this anime would be a great show for you.', ""Black Bullet is amazing, an amazing failure of a series with decent potential at its start.Black Bullet is an anime, an anime with great potential that ultimately transformed into shambles of disappointment. Many have been comparing Black Bullet to Attack on Titan but of course, Black Bullet is intrinsically different and distinct in its own right.The story revolves around humanity and their suppression due to the dominance and superior existence of viral parasites named Gastrea.  As humanity is left with no alternatives but to be exiled into small territory and to coexist with terror and despair, the world should evidently be indeed...a dark and tragic place to live in. To survive, the loli army, I mean the cursed children are prime and vital to combat the Gastrea and are humanity’s ultimate weapon born from women who have been infected by the Gastrea.The characters are merely bland and tedious to be the main focus of the show. Satomi Rentarou is the archetype of an indomitable, well preserved and determined male character which has been utilised throughout anime history in countless of shows. Having the best plot-armor possible, he’s pretty strong in combat too. Another character in the harem, I mean cast, Enju, the notable orange hair little loli girl is energetic to the max and does not know when to keep her mouth shut at times. Enju constantly mentions her wish to marry Rentarou, that being said, it is only normal for her to have a few rivals. One of them is Kisara Tendo, the president of the agency Satomi works for and also apparently is Satomi’s childhood friend, a good use of the childhood friend cliché to add a woman with a big chest to the crew. Another main character is Tina Sprout, another loli in the group of friends who fight against the Gastrea, with sniping skills of a God and the body of a 5 year old girl, she also takes a hinted liking to Satomi Rentarou. And for the rest of the loli cursed children army characters, let’s just say, never mind.Despite each character containing different personalities and traits, one factor largely affects the seriousness of the show, and that is the constant implementation of forced humour. The show is just ineffective in setting its own atmosphere, coming into the series; a person looking at the synopsis would come into Black Bullet believing that the show is serious and dark heavily. Scenes can be tragic and upsetting at times, leaving the audience to feel and express sympathy to the characters; however these sentimental moments are easily hindered and obstructed a few seconds later with unnecessary comedy. Being on the brink of extinction, the vibrant and lively atmosphere the cast give off does not blend in well with the plot.It’s like mixing sugar with salt. It just doesn't work well.Being a one-cour show, the show evidently suffers from lack of character growth and development and is bound to leave out some scenes from the original source material. The pacing transcends too quickly after the first episode and near the final few episodes of the show, it is amazingly obvious how rushed and butchered Black Bullet has become. No justice served for the source material.The art is vibrant and bright most of the time despite the supposed dark tone the plot gives off. Despite the contradiction, it is enjoying and nice to look at. However, honestly it makes the viewers hard to take the show seriously because of the liveliness when humanity is on the verge of extinction. The animation and visuals during action scenes do not make the show stand out amongst other shows with decent action scenes. The CGI utilised alongside the Gastrea are used awkwardly and are not pleasant to look at which I believe sometimes fits their design well as they are not meant to look aesthetically attractive and appealing being viral parasites.The music in the show is probably the single best aspect of the show. Having the OP sung by fripside and the ED songs sung by Yanagi Nagi, personally one of my favourite Japanese female singers, they added a new substance to the show and made it more enjoyable. Sadly, the background music being catchy is used too many times and not always at the most appropriate moment, losing its uniqueness, style and substance.Overall, if you want a serious and tragic show with a dark atmosphere, I do not recommend touching Black Bullet. However, if you love little girls, sure, dive in. Or if you just have lots of time, sure, dive in. Besides some decently executed moments, don’t go in with expectations as high as the Eifel Tower as you will only come out as the world’s shortest skyscraper. a dark and tragic place to live in.

But humanity has a secret weapon, an amazing weapon that will help humanity triumph against the evil Gastrea( which sounds like a stomach illness lol), and that only weapon they have is ........ lolis, yes lolis with some kind of power I didn\'t even care enough to get. So lets get down to business.Story: oh my.... yes ..ammm the story is as I already said about those alien...things attacking mankind for some reason, and there you have mankind fighting them. The best ""weapon"" humanity has is some lolis. This story had a little potential to be a good action show, but the most we got was the main character building his loli harem and flirting with other girls too. The story does not focus on the important things, most things are just ""shock factor"" scenes that made me cringe, the pacing was off, most things made no sense and you stop caring about the show about 10 min in the first episode(maybe even less).The lolis were oppressed or some shit cause they had this power and they were different and even if they were humanity\'s only hope humans still hated them? cause they could something .... ehhhh who cared for this anyway.2/10Animation and Sound : good soundtrack and good opening. The animation was quite good but nothing special. The opening was done by fripSide and it had the start of the song sound similar to the Attack On Titan opening(figures). But yeah it was a nice song nothing to complain about in this section.6/10Characters: Alpha male, his female friend who likes him (who would have thought) and a bunch of lolis.... yes........ The characters are just copied out of a textbook, nothing original to them, no one was likable except for maybe the first villain who was ofc. human. Near the end the main character starts to acting out of character for the sake of being ""badass"" but it makes him look like an annoying asshole and even those who might have liked him (not disliked him) started hating him. The lolis were quite explosive characters  tho ;) . Characters die and you couldn\'t care less, that shows how good the characters were.1/10Enjoyment : Bored to death, I wish I never watched this piece of crap. This show would have been the worst of the season if it was not for Brynhildr in the Darkness, (lucky aren\'t you)0/10Overall: A pice of poo, not worth watching, a waste of time.2/10 things attacking mankind for some reason, and there you have mankind fighting them.

Please note that this is purely my opinion on the series, you can agree with me or disagree with me, I\'m fine either ways.Black Bullet sets in an apocalyptic type of environment starting in the year 2021. The human race is being overwhelmed by the widespread of a deadly virus called the ""Gastrea"". Two protagonists: a Civil Security ""Promoter"" - Rentaro Satomi and his ""Initiator"" - Enju Aihara sets off to protect Japan from the evil that lies within the epidemic.Story...- 3/10To be blunt, I got to say I enjoyed the first 3 episodes of the anime but after that I had my bewildered face on the entire time for the remaining episodes. Not knowing where the series was going, I persist to keep on watching it, hoping for the plot to get better, however, it just did NOT happen.There are various plot holes that are yet to be filled and quite a few of things are left unexplained (e.g the origin of Gastrea, vague explanation of the surrounding environment as a whole).What irks me the most is that the population itself doesn\'t give me the vibe and the fear of being endangered. Everyone seems to have no problem dealing with their daily life issues even with Gastreas\' presence. In addition to this problem, multiple melodramas are shown in the series but they aren\'t necessary since they are there to stall for time, it merely demonstrates that the story is very unorganized and the scenes were done half-assed.Animation - 7/10The animation was good. Though I would prefer more movements for the characters that are standing far away in the background instead of a still- image. Overall, not choppy but at the same time not extremely flawless as well.Art - 8/10One of the things that I liked about Black Bullet is the art, the color palettes were used wisely and the shading is neat but I would like to see this definition applied to the characters as well.Sound - 8/10I enjoyed Black Bullet OSTs and have personally downloaded some of them. Sound effects were also properly utilized and seiyuus did well when they were casting their characters.Characters - 3/10One of the major problems that I find with the characters in Black Bullet is that most of them are not memorable and have little to zero character development. The chemistry is too low and I have trouble connecting with most of the characters in the series. Thus, do not share the same emotional responsesOne character that stands out to me is the self proclaimed antagonist Kagetane Hiruko. His random appearances and the way how he presents himself made me like him. Unfortunately, he was defeated by Rentaro in Episode 3 and did not made an appearance until episode 10, which is sad because this character could make things a lot more interesting. Other characters are not really worth mentioning since most of them take minor roles and do not appear later on making them forgettable.Black Bullet did a poor job of introducing new characters. It seems like they are being thrown in to the story for the heck of it. I get no information and I always have this puzzled look on every single new characters that somehow slips through the cracks and play a role in the series. Put Kisara\'s older brother as an example, he appeared in episode 13, came out of nowhere and apparently is the one that is responsible for not investing enough money to purchase stronger ""Varanium"" into the Monolith - a magical barrier that is supposed to protect Tokya Area from the Gastreas. Why wasn\'t I informed about this? Where did the information come from? What is his history as one of the protectors of Tokya Area? The series did not notify its audiences and most of the new characters appear unexpectedly.Final Verdict - (Enjoyment: 5/10, Overall 4/10)You know... Black Bullet could have been a MUCH BETTER anime series only if it enables us to know more about the characters and did not constantly rushes its scenes. I just couldn\'t get myself to enjoy the series as much as I expected to. Using merely 13 episodes to accomplish this just would not cut it. I think the producers of this series need to step back, take a breather and have a thorough think-through to how to better plan the events of Black Bullet, it doesn\'t matter if it takes more than 13 episodes as long as if things were explained better then I will be more than happy to give it a higher rating. - 3/10To be blunt, I got to say I enjoyed the first 3 episodes of the anime but after that I had my bewildered face on the entire time for the remaining episodes.

Unfortunately enough, a lot of what I heard held true, but not everything and those little girls weren\'t apart of that problem.Black Bullet essentially is an anime that tries hard to breach the conventional post-apocalyptic human-survival setting, but is unable to do so. The show gets stuck at a crosswalk confused if it wants to do something different or stick with the same formula. Perhaps Black Bullet\'s greatest vice is the pacing, which is abnormally quick. Even...for those whom have not read the light novel(such as myself) can painfully see when the chain of events are simply moving too quick for us to follow and understand. Although, while it had several cons and rough edges, it did have a few positives as well.Story (6/10):We\'re pretty much given the standard \'humanity struggling for survival against a mysterious alien race\'(The mysterious alien race here is the Gastrea), in Black Bullet, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing if executed correctly, but BB does not deliver exceptionally well when it came down to execution. As any story, Black Bullet attempted taking a concept that is well-known, adding their own flair to it by making Humanity\'s last hope the little girls. Oddly enough, this is where a lot of the negative stigma has come from and I don\'t think those accusations are rightly justified. When uncovering the reasoning and digging deeper into the plot, it actually seems interesting on how and why the world\'s fate is in the hands of little girls. It tries to question morals and how society may see those whom are different than the rest, but it just doesn\'t dabble much into that when it should have. The real big problem though becomes the pacing of the show. The anime for the most part was terribly paced, it went through many events and climatic moments in a heartbeat, giving an unsettle feeling of, ""What? It\'s over already?"" and leaving several questions unanswered. Although the pacing slightly does get better towards the end, it becomes far too late for it to save the show and unfortunately, the characters are severely affected by this too. We\'ll pick at the characters more later though.Art (8/10):Looking beyond the mountain of problems with Black Bullet, it does have its positives and the art is one aspect of that. The scenery, characters and Gastrea are all well-done and can actually be impressive when it came down to the action. I also think that many people whom are more interested in the characters will be pleasantly surprised as each character does have their distinct look and they\'re all for the most part appealing. It seems more obvious than not that they paid far more attention to how Black Bullet looked than other important details.Sound (8/10):Once again, it felt as though the studio focused on making sure the anime sounded good as well and it did. Whether it was making sure the Gastrea sounded as disgusting and beastly as possible, giving some \'beef\' to the sound of guns, music to set the mood and so-forth it was all rather pleasing and well-done, but it just feels unfortunate that while Black Bullet sounds good and looks good it lacks in other departments.Characters (6/10):As any anime, it\'s important to present a worthy cast to the viewer otherwise the plot would fall apart and the audience would lose interest. You could have the strangest and most terrible plot, but if you give a show great characters it would thrive. In the case of Black Bullet, which provides a wide array of characters in a meager 13 episodes, it\'s a lot of misses with a few done right fortunately enough. During the story segment of my review I talked about how the pacing affects the characters drastically and that\'s what their downfall is. Black Bullet is able to deliver to us plenty of characters that seem very interesting when we\'re introduced to, but because of how quickly events are moved none of these characters get a big chance to become something more. The main focus is always on our MCs, Rentaro and Enju, so for the majority of the time we\'ll be watching them. This wouldn\'t really be a problem if the anime was solely focused on them, but it\'s not. Black Bullet shows off plenty of unique characters which would seem to be worthy of our attention, but they just get thrown on the back burner once introduced. The anime tries hard to make the characters \'evolve\' by hitting us with short back-stories and shocking/thrilling events, but they\'re over in a blink of an eye and get tossed to make room for the next characters\' turn. A lot of these events and interactions between characters would have actually been quite good, but they required more time to expand, which evidently, they didn\'t have and ended in a mess for a lot of characters. Luckily, a few characters do manage to stay afloat in the mess and become more important in the show and interesting to us. Thanks to some of the characters\' involvement and personalities it isn\'t all bad. Unfortunately, for a lot of the other characters, you just cannot get attached to them at all no matter how hard you try.Enjoyment (7/10):Looking beyond the irrelevant characters and absurd pacing, Black Bullet was somewhat enjoyable. Black Bullet piggybacked on its, \'Looks good, feels good\' attitude and did so by presenting smooth high-tension action, great music and sometimes pulling sucker punches on the audience with some messed-up events that judge our sense of morals and compares it to those of the show. The story wasn\'t completely terrible as I was able to follow and have a general understanding of what was going on and while I didn\'t like many characters there were a few whom I did appreciate. Although there are plenty positives, there are far more negatives which I nor many can ignore.Overall (6/10):Black Bullet is an anime that had plenty of potential, but didn\'t use much of it. At the start it had an interesting set-up, intriguing characters and the looks, but in the end all it had was its looks and that just doesn\'t cut it. If the pacing was slowed down and they expanded more on the characters, we could have seen something great, but we just didn\'t. A very small number of characters in the cast and the \'looks good, feels good\' attitude was really Black Bullet\'s saving grace. It was entertaining, but non-memorable and it aches me to see an anime that could have been so much more, just be nothing more than another more-or-less mediocre show. While it\'s not terrible as many people have claimed it to be, it\'s not that great either. It\'s unfortunate to see while Rentaro, Enju and Co. are out saving the world, they couldn\'t save Black Bullet from being mediocre. for those whom have not read the light novel(such as myself) can painfully see when the chain of events are simply moving too quick for us to follow and understand.

It creates monstrous bug like creatures known as Gastrea  and is also responsible for giving superhuman powers to some of the female population (young girls) who are despised by others and are called the ""cursed children"". The story centers around  Rentarou and his partner Enju (cursed child) who fight to push back the Gastrea threat.Art(10/10):The art was wonderful, action was fast and pretty. Character designs...were everything one would hope for.Sound(9/10):The opening and outro music were both something you would freely listen to in your free time. The ost which recently came out is the perfect music when the action starts. As for voice acting it was as expected - good.Characters(10/10):Black bullets true strength lies with it’s characters! One wouldn’t expect a 13 ep anime to have such dept and character development right? Wrong!The two main characters Rentarou and Enju partnership is well developed with the short time  given it doesn’t feel rushed at all like most manga promotional animes, what to me is amazing.As the story continues Rentarou and Enju’s bond deepens and they rally up a few friend along the way. Even most side characters have their little story and reasons for fighting.The main villain is mysteries masked badass who is strong and a bit out of it but looks cool and is a good match for the two mains.In the character development view point it feels like every second of the anime goes as it should nothing is slow or rushed it just feels natural.Overall(10/10):The story itself isn’t unique or astonishing BUT it’s the well developed characters what makes it one of the best animes i have watched. It also doesn’t hurt to have awesome art and glorious music along the way as you see the story unfold. were everything one would hope for.Sound(9/10):The opening and outro music were both something you would freely listen to in your free time.

Do you like seeing naked little girls who are only about ten years old fawning and craving for sexual activity from a much older guy while also having said little girls being covered with slime coupled with an Attack on Titan clone narrative that is rushed beyond belief? Well, then you\'ll love the hell out of this train wreck of a series.This anime is like your first sexual experience; it may seem great at first, much like the show\'s killer opening but much like the amine\'s fast pacing, it will be over in about ten seconds. Well, with that horrible...analogy out of the way let\'s talk about all the problems with this show, and oh boy, there sure is a LOT.Let\'s start with the basics: the narrative. The story of Black Bullet is essentially another god damn plot in which humans are pushed to the brink of extinction by some kind of calamity or monster; and in this case, we have spider-like creatures called the Gastrea. Aside from these creatures being a rip off of the monsters from the anime Blue Gender, a show from sixteen years ago,  the creatures hardly pose any threat whatsoever. They\'re not as creepy as the Titans from Attack on Titan nor as threatening as the Blue from Blue gender; they\'re forgetful and boring. Not only that, we\'re told by our main protagonist that the world is near destruction but everything seems to be as fine as an episode of My Little Pony. It\'s the same problem with the anime The Asterix war from last year. Both shows tell the audience that the characters are living in some kind of morally grey world that is nearing its destruction via an opening narration by the main character but never actually show what they\'re describing in the visuals.The world of Black Bullet doesn\'t feel like humanity struggling to stay alive like the narrator would suggest; instead it feels like a day out with Yogi Bear since no one in the show sees these monsters as any kind of threat, even more so as we see the main character quickly running to buy eggs which are on sale after easily defeating one of these beasts. As a result, there is no lingering sense of tension or uneasiness, which was one of the few things Attack on Titan got right at the very least. Here it feels weak and pathetic.The story is nothing to write home about and does a terrible job at immersing you into the world. Light novel guy (aka Rentarou - the main protagonist; I\'m just going to be referring to every crappy light novel character as this now) is a guy who goes around stopping various incidents and attacks made by the Gastrea with his loli sidekick, Pedophile-chan, a girl who has the power of these creatures. There are many other little girls with these sort of powers which are referred to as the ""cursed children"" and are hated by all of society, frequently being beaten by the populace and shunned for who they are. This could have been an interesting theme if they had spent more time with it and got a component writer. But nope, it\'s awful. They use one of the cheapest tricks: shock factor, to try and make you feel bad for these girls in the tritest way possible. Not only are all of these girls about the age of ten and are made to appear as young as possible in order to pull at your heartstrings, but many of them also die in such terrible ways to manipulate you into feeling something. Some of them are killed in a bomb attack, another gauged out her own eyes; it\'s pathetic how hard they want you to sympathise with these girls without even trying to develop these characters in the slightest. Shock factor is the laziest way to try and make the audience feel for these little girls as it requires no actual effort; just make it as extreme as possible and the otakus will eat it up.The narrative tries way too hard to be dark and edgy but this is immediately ruined as it believes that it\'s fine to be dark and serious one moment and then silly and full of fan service in the immediate next moment.  This whiplash is awful and it undercuts all of the dramatic moments of the show. When we end one scene with a little girl dying and we follow it up with a stupid joke featuring a naked loli in the next scene it breaks immersion and feels stupid. Do people have the attention span of a goldfish or something? Can we just stick with one tone and keep it consistent throughout? If you want to be dark and edgy then stick to just that, or at the very least, make the transitions between these two moods more natural otherwise it becomes a joke.Anyway, light novel guy is as generic and boring as you could imagine when it comes to a main male protagonist of a light novel adaptation. Most of the female cast fall in love with him by the end, he has no personality to speak of, never develops in the slightest and stays as equally generic as everything else in this production. He is full of stupid ass pulls and is also the strongest character in the show, making him nothing more than a bland self-insert for all of the thirteen-year-olds watching this crap. They try and present his character as being full of fear and anxieties, with the underlying idea that he believes he is useless but not nearly enough time is invested in this theme and it comes across as forced drama instead. His loli sidekick, Pedophile-chan is not much better either. She too barely changes and instead remains a loli who wants to have sex with the main protagonist just to show her appreciation. She does have a tragic back-story which could have been developed into an interesting subplot concerning her anxieties and discrimination for who she is but it\'s resolved in only a few minutes so any interest derived from this character is quickly shunted to the side.There is a villain who was a walking deus ex machina for a few episodes before being beaten by our god Light novel guy four times. FOUR FUCKING TIMES! The villain was pretty enjoyable the first time he was introduced, as he was more fun than anything but as the show went along, his motives became even more of a jumbled mess and his character arc went literally nowhere. There are other characters but they\'re so uninteresting and dull there is no point in even mentioning them since they hardly impact the story in the slightest. The only thing that develops in this show is light novel guy\'s loli collection.If everything I\'ve listed thus far wasn\'t bad enough, the pacing for this anime is by far the worst I have ever seen before. We run through this show at breakneck speed, never allowing the audience a moment to drink in all of the visual stimuli that are being thrown at us every five god damn seconds and there is hardly any downtime between any of the major events in the story to allow for some character development and growth. This problem is made worse as we reach the finale, and here the writer threw every single stupid idea he had into a blender and just hoped for the best. Characters are randomly introduced, new power-ups are pulled out of thin air, characters die abruptly everywhere. It\'s a mess! The final scene in which Boobs Mcjiggy (light novel guy\'s boss, or whatever) killed a man in cold blood came out of goddamn nowhere and felt like such a cheap way to end the story on an edgy cliff-hanger that it was laughably pathetic.On top of all this bullshit, we have some of the worst cases of badly implemented exposition I have ever seen. No one in this horse vomit speaks like a normal person, explaining every single little detail to the audience as if we\'re idiots and we can\'t figure out anything for ourselves. It\'s boring to sit through and an insult to our intelligence levels.The animation and fight choreography was okay and it does a decent job but it\'s nothing special in the slightest and is definitely nothing substantial enough to raise the bar of this animation production. While I would say the animation is average at best, they had to mess it up by the usage of CG, and this is some of the worst cases of CG integration intermixed with traditional 2D animation I\'ve seen. The Gastrea look god damn awful and make me want to gouge out my eyes with a kitchen utensil. The opening song is pretty kick ass and gets you excited for the proceeding content only to be met with the crushing realisation that you\'re watching the pile of trash known as Black Bullet...In conclusion, this show was atrocious. There was no effort, no talent, no passion; nothing. It\'s an empty husk with no ideas and no originality. The characters were boring, the plot made no logical sense half the time, it tries way too hard to be edgy, it\'s full of dull shock factor and you should stay far away from it. There is not a single thing I can say about this show which leads to the positive side of the spectrum, it\'s that bad, so, therefore, more than qualifies for a rank \'1\'. Again, stay away from this one. Unless you\'re one of those sick twat who get a kick out of watching terrible light novel adaptations...like me. analogy out of the way let\'s talk about all the problems with this show, and oh boy, there sure is a LOT.Let\'s start with the basics: the narrative.

Unless you\'re one of those sick twat who get a kick out of watching terrible light novel adaptations...like me.', 'Since the day i have watched shingeki no kyojin, i started to become a slighty attached to animes with some apocalyptic themes, where humans are faced with something that would end their existence, and in the same time, we could see the despair and the feeling of less hope in their eyes. This Spring\'s year have launched a lot of good animes as No game no life, DBZ Kai 2014, Fairy tail 2014 and others animes aswell. Most of them have catch my attention like NGNL and this interesting anime called Black Bullet. After reading the sinopse, i had some high expectations, even if the...idea is not so original, somehow, catches me because have a different setting and also a different enviroment and atmosphere. I Won\'t say that the series is a disappointment, unlikely, is a very good series, the problem is...the adaptation. Lets not waste time and start to the point uh?Story: 6/10Let\'s go to the part that makes me a little disappointed and yet amazed, the story. The story focus near the future where humans are being exterminated by a parasital virus called Gastrea, while they live this hystorical terror moment, they are obligated to live in small territories living with the despair, horror and fear of the monsters. For at least increases a little the hope in the heart of the humanity, is created the ""civil security"", members of organization that fights against gastreas. The story starts with Satomi Rentaro, one member of the civil security aside his partner Enju Aihara, where they both have to take dangerous missions involving gastreas for fight for survive and save the humanity from the destruction. The story may be not so original yet...is extremelly amazing duo the events that happens on it principally with the cursed childrens(childrens like Enju that born with some gastrea blood for fight equal to equal with them) that constantly suffer racism and prejudice and more other factors in the anime, increasing the dark atmosphere and gripping events. I\'m pretty sure you will ask ""LoneNinja123, if the story is that much amazing and good, why you give it a 6?"" - is simple, the adaptation. Black Bullet have a mediocre adaptation, by watching it, you can easy see that the animators skipped a lot of important things that caused some less impact in some scenes of the anime. Is very rushed and left a lot..and i mean A LOT of things unexplained. Duo this fact, a other problem appears, the anime itself have different arcs at 4 and 4 episodes. Duo the bad adaptation, it feels like in the first 4 episodes you are watching a arc, then in the others 4 episodes(4-8) you are watching a other arc, that don\'t have any ligation with the first one. Is very weird, i believe that because of the bad adapation and a lot of skipped inforation, every arc don\'t have a ligation one by one. I\'m pretty sure if they adapt the anime just like the novel and manga, somehow would be something that would link every arc to make sense of why the events are going like that. Thats why i rate 6 in the story and also why i\'m disappointed, the bad adaptation makes some parts very confused and they could have done better than it, explained everything but they end making this  and left many things without explanation and also confused to understand.Art: 8/10I really liked the art of Black bullet for most simple it is. It doesn\'t have full of details but yet the colors and designs are pretty good, i really enjoyed Hiruko, Satomi and Enju\'s designs, also i really loved every effects in the fights scenes on the anime. They did a very good job, but for a anime where humans are facing the fear and despair for being destroyed, more details in the facial expression would be pretty good aswell, incluing the eyes that could be better, they come out too simple.Sound: 9/10One of the best things in the anime are the soundtracks. I really like OP and i really loved the ED(i prefer the ED more) also every track and OSTs fits the scene that the anime want to show. Its simple beautiful the beats on the fight themes, the orchestra, guitarl and piano themes are very well done. It helped a lot build the gripping dark atmosphere of the anime and also are memorable for many people that will hear.Characters: 5/10This part will be mixed between positive and negative. I loved Most of Black bullet characters as Satomi, Enju, Tina, Hiruko, Kisara and etc. They all have different personalities: calm, insane, cute, violent, determinated and etc. For most stereotypical they be, they have something that differ from the characters of other animes, thats is how they react depending of a event they are in. It express a lot of reality, and somehow you can feel how they are feeling in a determinated scene, where most of the times you beg for them and other times you feel very sorry for what happens, it\'s really good. Now that we have heard the positive side, lets go to the negative, i really wanted to rate 9 in the characters, but i have already told you guys the problem of Black bullet having a bad adaptation, and duo the a lot of missing informations, most of the characters don\'t have a very well constructed backgroud story, in other words, in a scene where you could be sad for them....you will be like...for example...neutral. The lack of information creates some characters that could have been memorable somehow...but ends being left without causing any impact, of course there are exceptions but cmon, this really disappoints. All characters should have their respective attention, so we could have enjoyed them more. Other problem is...how i can put...the characters fast change of mood during some scenes....from sad...goes to determinated...happy to angry, etc. Is very unreal in this part but they are stil enjoyable somehow.Enjoyment: 7/10I personally enjoyed Black Bullet very much but duo the lack of information and a great amount of a unexplained things, the anime come out with some confusing things, decreasing the excitement but yet, is still a very good anime to watch and you will personally enjoy.Overall: 7/10Black Bullet had eveything for become a very good anime, with amazing sounds; characters and stories. but for a mediocre adaptation, it turned to be something inferior than what could have become, a memorable anime. Is still good to watch and enjoy. The Novel is still ongoing, so i hope if they make a second season, make a better adaptation than what the season one be, with a lot more of suprises and twists.Pros:+Great Atmosphere+Great Character Variety+Beautiful Memorable Soundtracks and OSTs+Gorgeous Animation and Stunning Visuals/Effects.Cons:-Its very rushed. Lack of Information and Many unexplained things that affected in many areas of the anime. idea is not so original, somehow, catches me because have a different setting and also a different enviroment and atmosphere.

Black Bullet has a lot of tragedy and an idea that could lead to a very good long term plot.Despite being only 13 episodes, the plot that we were presented with was still very well done and you are clearly presented with the problems that the characters attempt to fix.

Soon he was chosen to be in Uber tiers and now we start of with an action oriented...story badly unfolding itself.REVIEW:Immediately, I can't take a show seriously once I see flipping lolicons being uber bad asses killing insane monsters and trying to make it look all gritty and dramatic and jazz, sure, slap my majestic face if You said that “Its because of the virus that infected their genes!” But do I remember an Anime when the Lolita topic has ever been taken in a mature and serious manner? Like an NHK with Lolicons? EXCACTLY.The story does feel predictable because action, edginess, future dystopia and lolis doing most of the dirty work because the instant You notice the protagonist and he's loli waifu with the whole “Destopian and monsters” thing, I am reminded of how Eren Yeager is so well plot armoured, and because the show tried to portray itself as a dark and edgy show, it collapses in delivering that type of content since one scene shows how this Loli so lonely and other scenes showing the two having a sexual bath together!This shows the anime that it glorifies Lolita as a context to be fantasised yet trying to squeeze in those dark and predictable moments to make everyone sad.OK, ignoring the Loli aspect, the “Non-Loli” of the show are just lame. I can't remember a single persona change from those people right at the end of the series except for a few kewl power ups. The protagonist is absolutely generic as generic can get Eren Yeager style, the potential Waifus look more like sex objects than actual characters because “Archetpyes” sell and I stopped taking the show seriously when I saw the cover art in Crunchy Roll. The rest of the cast are the same thing like the tomboy, the quiet one, the feisty one, the stoner one and of course the c*nty one.The lolis can also fit in the same space with the rest of the absolutely generic cast.The only purpose for what may be a redeeming, would be the whole “Loli-Action” aspect if You're ever that curious to see how little girls fight to the death and to see some brain-dead action material, but, it is contradictory to how I review a show as a “Whole” by giving it a higher score through certain highlights, and we all know how bad Train Wrecks can be at times....I quote Aristotle: “The whole is bigger than the sum of its parts”.Gastrea might as well be a weaker version of the Titans from AoT, but of course, for such monsters to be effective the audience must be more sucked into the situations of the characters, interactions, complexity, emotions etc. Though because the show flopped on that department because of reasons I don't need to re-explain, also, the Gastrea are meant to be an excused backdrop to make via characters be what they are, though this can be used for other creative stuff like symbolism, tension, deaths etc. This it show does not take a better advantage of it. Consequently it does have resemblance on what it could actually do, however it doesn’t help but to make all of that tension, drama, plot etc. to feel corny rather than genuine since You don't even care if any of these people were being tentacled!The story overall having this whole mystery is aspect feels more stupid than anything else like how they never explain this weaker Loli to be one of the most b*tches ever, and yes it does have its “Good Moments” of basic fundamentals on how to make a dystopia look dystopia, like how everyone has the courstousy to take apocalyptic situations seriously but because the protagonist is so much like an Eren Yeager clone with a horridly directed side cast and the ability to survive certain death situations with BS reason, or how he's the only guy who uses two loli's in battle, or how You can predict that Enju will most unlikly die in a year or two at the second season because of plot armour.The villain sucks, he's like this really cheesy guy who You never see he's identity and apparently smiling behind the mask or just trying to have unique vocal chords being full of SO much mystery and jazz is just stupid because there is no dimensionality within that!The mysteriy aspect is mediocrity at finest but if I try to weigh in everything else, it overall feels as if the writers forgotten all of that potential foreshadowing in later episodes and just throw in a bunch of arse pulls that is supposed to make us think, but I'm not bothered cuz the show is so bad!Overall, this show is just “Dum” sure, You can make a nice kick for Yourself to see a beta version of Loli-Death simulator You must cry at face value 2050, with a Kirito surrounded by little girls readying themselves to be he's whore, but it constantly contradicts itself from what’s fantasy and edginess...Animated by Orange being there first full time production instead of working in the shady background assisting the other companies,  though CGI used at the end feels very cheap budgeted, but it overall keeps itself consistent and retains its quality. Though it is not something crazy like an Ufotable production, it is suffice to say that the backgrounds look well detailed, a larger portion of character designs don't feel completely cheap and the fight scenes involving lolis or someone using a metallic fist to kill some monsters can look great at times. The lighting also feels nice, though it doesn’t use a more creative colour scheme, it still feels crisp and clean. The Gastrea design is completely forgettable and it doesn't put emphasis on any level of scare factor at all.Anime doesn't do a huge deal of dubstep, but when its there its really damn good. The OP feels like generic J-Pop but its action themed so I suppose it will get you kind of hyped for future episodes, and the dubstep-like OST fits really well with the mood of the series for when it get serious, wanna see an epic battle? Are You crying from the dying lolis? Do You want bland comedic fun? It fits all that but the dubstep orchestral mix were always the selling point for me. Consequently it does feel rather repetitive repeating that same tune over and over again can feel rather boring, overall its good, but I'm not a person who would tolerate repetitive tunes.LEGACY:Just get a kick with Loli-Death simulator if You really want brain-dead action, since the show is most memorable for lolis fighting to the death. Its not epic, its not deep, its not dark but overall has pretentious writing on its throat like so many other train wrecks. I watch this show, and forget it. And everyone forgets it.SCORES:3/10 – Utterly forgetful character cast. I didn’t hated them, their just boring!4/10 – Tries to be cute yet edgy at the same time, so the show fails with an identity crisis, though it does manage to get there at the latter, the story is still stupid.6.5/10 – Above average production I must say, and characterdesigns are most valued on the Lolicons and to see how cool it is for them to death battle each other.6./10 – OST has a bunch of techno music with orchestra and jazz, does the job in an above average manner.

Basically what this means is that despite a series having some sort of massive flaw, depending on how you look at it you might (or might not) still be able to ignore that side for the most part and just have a good time watching it anyway.And at least in my opinion, Black Bullet is one of those shows.Let's start with the bad part then. As you'll find out by reading the comments for this anime essentially anywhere, what this show doesn't...seem to understand is a little something called pacing. Like so many other series before it, Black Bullet is an anime that quite simply should have had a 2-cour airing instead of 1, without extending the amount of content it covers from the original light novels. The story moves on with an absolutely blistering speed, making every episode feel like it was actually two or three episodes compressed together into one. This results in the seemingly simplistic plot becoming somewhat incomprehensible at times, simply because the anime doesn't spare the time to take a breather and explain just what the hell is currently going on or why.The premise itself isn't that bad though, it's a classical setup of a post-apocalyptic world where the last remnants of humanity are trying to survive and eventually push back the invaders called Gastraea; a species of ginormous parasitic bugs that can look like anything spanning from insects to dinosaurs. Mindless, but it works, it's just that the plot moves along too fast for its own good most of the time.Well then, with all that out of the way, let's move on to the slightly less negative aspects shall we?The character cast of this show doesn't really have too much depth behind it, which again is an indirect consequence of the absurd pacing the anime has. However fear not, because as it happens, Black Bullet's choice of character tropes is aimed at an audience which doesn't care about such plebian details. I am of course talking about badass supernatural lolis with guns and swords!This is a total make or break factor varying from viewer to viewer I should say. If you are part of the loli hate train then I would say that this fact combined with the pacing should be enough for me to say that this anime is probably not for you. However if you're as much of a lolicon as I am, then it will instead be part of what saves the show, as the anime has countless of them and they deliver pretty much what you'd want them too. Especially the lead heroine Enju is incredibly moe and adorable, and just livens up the anime whenever she gets screen time. Love her character design.Other than that there really isn't too much to say about Black Bullet. It is a bit dark albeit nothing massive, and the plot kind of stumbles upon itself, however at the same time it also resulted in the anime constantly switching from exciting scenes to exciting scenes, as the hyperactive pacing at least assured that there was always something happening in the story. Ironically this might have actually increased the enjoyment value for me in a way, as it became an extremely marathonable show due to its constant action, however looking at the big picture then obviously the overarching story is suffering from it.As a final shoutout I also have to mention that out of all the anime I've seen this season (note, I have not seen all of them mind you), Black Bullet has by far and wide the best OP *and* ED songs at the same time, especially the opening reminded me a lot of the first OP from Shingeki no Kyojin. Of course that’s hardly enough to carry the show on its own, but it deserves an honorable mention at least.Final rundown:Story – 4/10: However I think this could have been like 7 or 8 had it been properly adaptedCharacters – 3/10: If you're not a lolicon, 8/10: If you are a loliconArt – 6/10: Didn't even feel the need to comment on this, but it was pretty average/standardSound – 10/10: Best of the seasonEnjoyment – 9/10: Despite its flaws, I had a ton of fun watching this show. This number would probably be lowered quite drastically if you, again, don't like lolis, or try to take the plot too seriously, as doing so would only make you focus on its shortcomings. You're better off just turning your brain off a bit and tagging along for the ride, because if you do so then it's actually a pretty fun ride. seem to understand is a little something called pacing.

Because i love the mix of these elements but in truth they are just good, no more and no less: it\'s like when you try something good to eat but not exceptional, you\'ll remember only ""it was good"" without remember every single detail. But let me explain better.Story - It\'s not really an original one but more like an original mix of...many things: a duo team, contagious virus and a discriminated superpowered race (surprise! they are loli). The story has ""small arcs"" and a very fast pace, often too fast (almost nothing of their past) and many scenes are ""condensed"" in few minutes (that\'s probably because it\'s an adapation and 13 episode were not enough) but it\'s easy to understand with small ""surprises"" occasionally.Character - I don\'t like loli, really i don\'t, but you can\'t possibly don\'t like good natured people fighting to protect even people who despise them. So, returning to the topic, even if i really don\'t like loli and these little girls don\'t have a ""deep personality"" (except Tina) i think they are more then fine; i want to remember to many of you that are thinking ""they are just bland"" that they are kids, so don\'t expect ""death note""-like reasoning from them ! About MC (main character) i think it\'s a bit classic but he faces some interesting ""moral choices"" making him somewhat interesting.Action - This is the ""weak point"" for me. There is a lot of action but is often rushed and for most of the show not really ""spectacular"": fights here are usually done with bullet, blades and punches; nothing flashy.Feelings - Here the best point. I don\'t really think it\'s an ""harem"" because unless you are really a pedo you can\'t really want to marry a little girl so in this anime we are talking about the ""true meaning of love"". Hey what? Are you serious? I am. I am not kidding. Love is care about others, even enemies: sometimes you got hurt for your misplaced trust and sometimes your love make people better, letting them love other people and the circle continues.So if:-you are good guy (i don\'t think you can understand many things here if you are a selfish one)-you like action-you like the seinenyou should watch it! many things: a duo team, contagious virus and a discriminated superpowered race (surprise! they are loli).

The main characters don't have anything that makes them special or sets them apart from other anime's.but that isn't a big problem. There are more anime's that don't have...very fleshed out characters. But the difference is that those stories focus on something different like the story or the animation. Black Bullet sort of tries to focus on a good story, and the fighting that is presented in the show. The problem is that the story isn't that good and that the fight scenes aren't that good.The reason the story isn't so good, is because of the contradictions with the story itself.

An interesting story, excellent writing, fluid pacing, an appealing art style, a good soundtrack, and character development just to name a few. This, as you can imagine, is really difficult to do; that\'s why there\'s not that many ""great"" anime titles out there. But even if a show isn\'t ""great"" by critical standards, that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be incredibly fun and satisfying to watch. Black Bullet is one of these shows - I\'ll be the first to admit that the writing isn\'t the best. Many...of the plot points are hopelessly contrived and at times while watching you\'ll just kind of throw your hands up in the air while mouthing, ""Really?""But… that doesn\'t mean I didn\'t enjoy the hell out of this series. Which I did. I laughed and I cried (the feels - oh did I cry), cheered, yelled, frowned and ultimately smiled. In that way I feel like Black Bullet is on the same level of (if not slightly higher than) shows like Strike the Blood, Tokyo Ravens and Guilty Crown: if you enjoyed those you\'ll probably enjoy this one. Black Bullet has a lot of things going for it - the music is amazing and the art is beautiful, especially the character designs.Just a word of warning though - you WILL shed some tears during the course of this series.

Thanks for your patience.Two words sum up Black Bullet very well: Paradise LostI began watching this series out of curiosity, since it had finished airing last week. The first episode blew me away in terms of art, sound, and story. I was deeply interested in the Black Bullet's world, and I wanted to find out more. I prematurely gave this anime a 9/10 rating after the first four episodes, but that rating slowly decreased into a 6/10. At the end of...the series I was left with an opinion on what the show was and what it could have been.Black Bullet is a prime example of how a potentially great series can be ruined with sub-par pacing. It was imprudent to abridge such an enormous universe and story into a mere 13 episode show.The story of the anime is quite intriguing, and you will see many other viewers refer to Attack on Titan or other dystopian anime series for Black Bullet’s dark world of humans’ fight against alien parasite. The premise of the story is certainly strong, but it is dragged down to terrible rating due to the quick pacing of the series. The first four episodes is a very interesting arc, and has a mini climatic moment in itself. Quickly after this, the series slowly deteriorates and diverges from its main selling point: badass action and emotional feels.The story is very complex and deserves a bit more than what most critiques are willing to give. The internal conflict of the city and the cursed, the fight against an alien race, and the personal struggles of the characters are very intriguing and interesting. Yet the main problem results from inadequate screen time spent on those important conflicts and emotional triggers, and this restricts the series from becoming more than average.The art and sound of the show are very sharp and sleek. They really make the show shine and sparkle despite the many inherent flaws. The character designs are very well done, and the music (original soundtrack, not the OP and ED) sets the mood for both the serious and happy moments.The characters, while inherently interesting and strong, suffer from a lack of screen time and important development. The anime focuses strongly on a handful of characters, while ignoring the other very important side characters who play a pivotal role in the story. Many times, you are overwhelmed with random characters that explain the political aspect of the series, and you’re left scratching your head on who that character even is.Overall, I enjoyed the series. I don’t believe it was a waste of my time in anyway, and I’m sure that the light novels are really interesting (I have not read any of them prior to this review). If only this anime took its time and expanded the episodes from 13 to 26, then many of the problems could have been fixed. I’m sad to see it end on such a sour note, and I hope a second season can perhaps make amends.*Personal advice to those who do not want to watch the entire series due to overall negative reviews: Watch the first four episodes of the series, and leave it at that. This series is similar to the TV show Dexter – it becomes progressively worse, but the beginning is really amazing. First four episodes = 9/10 rating. the series I was left with an opinion on what the show was and what it could have been.Black Bullet is a prime example of how a potentially great series can be ruined with sub-par pacing.

The characters feel empty and the story isn't there to amaze you either. The last episode really sums this show up: one predictable plot twist after another and setting things up for the plausible season two.Not worth the time if you want a good story with good characters. "", ""Black Bullet was a series I actually genuinely enjoyed watching. I'm not big on loli or any other such type of thing, but this series was actually really enjoyable almost the entire way through, but I'll go further into details with that later on.Animation: 7The art direction and the overall animation for the series is very well done. It's fluid and the action sequences are fast-paced and get you pumped. However in comparison to other titles that have aired around the time this did it falls short.Music: 6This section would have been higher if not for one reason. Instead of paying attention to the...music during the sequences the art and animation took far more attention from me as did the events in the storyline. The music I did manage to hear though fit the situations quite nicely. Because of it not feeling all that important in comparison to the story and art it only gets a six though.Characters: 8All the characters in the main cast were pretty enjoyable to be honest. The antagonists save for one specific character were just... frustrating. They got my blood boiling, soooo... well done! The one I enjoyed though was that guy who seemed to always find a way into the main character's head and mess with him which made him all the more likeable as an antagonist.Story: 5Oh boy... This would have been a lot higher of a score if not for the season ended... The storyline up until episode thirteen was enjoyable. It didn't seem to have any plot holes and a lot of the time I was freaking out over Rentaro's actions and loving the series. However the story decides to try and pull a plot twist that while not feeling forced, felt like it lacked any form of logic the series had up until that point and making one character seem completely different from how she was the entire series only to leave us with a terrible cliffhanger and no season two in sight. The ending alone lowered the score for the story which could have easily been a seven or an eight possibly.Overall: 6It was fine, but without a season two this series just seems to lack anything truly worthwhile. It's a fun ride, but don't watch this if you like conclusive endings. If a season two gets made then I'd definitely recommend watching it. However if you can't stand the type of cliffhanger ending I have previously mentioned then this is definitely not for you...less music during the sequences the art and animation took far more attention from me as did the events in the storyline.

However, despite the monoliths, there are rare instances when Gastrea are able to surpass the barriers and invade the towns within.Enter the Civil Security Corporation, the organisation formed for the control and regulation of Gastrea attacks.  The Corporation forms teams consisting...of one Promoter and one Initiator, who are sent to subjugate the invading Gastrea. The Promoter is responsible for battle strategy, whereas the Initiator, a Cursed Child, is in charge of combat. A Cursed Child refers a young female, infected with the Gastrea virus, which possesses heightened or even superhuman abilities, ranging from close combat to marksmanship.Starring the calm and level-headed Promoter Satomi Rentarou and his Initiator, the bubbly and agile ten-year old Aihara Enju, Black Bullet revolves around the pair whose job is to counter the threat of Gastrea.[REVIEW]On the surface, Black Bullet is essentially a series targeted towards shounen to seinen, given that its content depends heavily on cute, young girls fighting monstrous creatures also known as Gastrea. As with many other series targeted towards said audience, light-hearted comedy ensues in spite of the story’s evidently dark and post-war setting; the characters do benefit from the occasional change of pace, from fast-paced combat to a more relaxed and casual daily school life setting. Inevitably, this seems to be where majority of Black Bullet’s relief from fighting takes place, with moments of comedy and fan-service condensed so as to satisfy the young male demographic.That said, Black Bullet does still do what it says on the box. Action and combat scenes are depicted cleanly and consistently, offering high-adrenaline fighting sequences to give the viewer a sense of being on the battlefield itself. For the most part, fights take place between the series’ protagonists and various enemies aiming to conquer the post-apocalyptic Earth, and not solely Gastrea. This helps to ensure Black Bullet does not turn stale as quickly and gives the reader something to look forward to.Nevertheless, some might feel that Black Bullet does regrettably struggle to set itself apart from other titles in a widely-explored, albeit repetitive, genre such as action. Fans of the genre can tell you that “a world where the human race is devastated by a new superior species”, be it aliens or parasites such as Gastrea, is a commonly used backbone of many action novels (see Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, Noragami etc). Predictably then, Black Bullet does therefore rely heavily on its “young girls fighting our battles for us” theme to distinguish itself from an array of other dystopian combat series.Story: 7/10As stated above, Black Bullet does seem rather reminiscent of other apocalyptic action series. It does thankfully stand out due to its use of adorable lolis though.Art: 9/10Clean and crisp art, with fight scenes being quite well-paced and exciting. Animation quality is also very consistent and is generally eye-candy. Especially if you're someone who likes adorable lolis, which is like, everyone. :shot:Sound: 7/10Voice acting and music are well done and consistent, although the music does get a little repetitive at times. Plus Hidaka Rina is your female lead. Instant win.Character: 7/10Not as much character development as compared to the light novel, which could have been expected, honestly. You still get a sense of each character being an individual and not just a copy off some other shounen manga though. And pretty much everyone but Rentarou is very likeable. Not that having another protagonist who always wins is a bad thing.Enjoyment: 8/10Very enjoyment, er, enjoyable. Black Bullet fulfils its job as an action series while boasting fantastic art and great voice acting. Plus lolis. Did I mention lolis?Overall: 8/10All in all, while I feel that Black Bullet might not be the most unique output of the “action” genre, it does hold its own niche as a child-combat anime/ novel. It does also deliver on the action as promised. Comedic relief used here and there during downtime from fighting prevents the story from crumbling into a dark, overly-negative mess, which is greatly appreciated due the fact that Black Bullet is, after all, a series targetted towards seinen, and to an extent shounen. Black Bullet's tried-and-tested story allows it to be a very enjoyable series.

In my opinion it was rally good and the story is a lot different than the other animes so i really liked it. Its true that there are a lot of lolis but still its just the joke  overall it was really good.People really hatre it but if its really bad then it woudnt haverating over 5 but itdoes and its fax. There were  a lot of deaths in it  but taht just make it more realistic since they cant all survive...like in otheer animes ""TENSURA\' uh yeah. Anyways the mc  was really kind hearted and idk why people call him lolicon when he is a really nice guy.  I would really liked to see another season but sadly they dropped the ln series. like in otheer animes ""TENSURA\' uh yeah.

It is an anime that you have to watch concentrated, else it will throw you of and you probably will tend not to like.Reasoning for that is the fast pacing, everything happens in a fast manner that it may throw you of if you werent watching carefully. Go in with an open mind at it will pay of.Black Bullet may be an overdone scenario, but it is yet more unique than you might think it to be....At the beginning you are greeted wiith a rather horrible scenario. Humanity in colonies, the sky is red and clouded while their surroundings are partly burning. They think they might be save but a giant monster crashes through the sky, inflicting panic and many death before it finally came to death as the scene stops on our main protagonist, Rentaro.It is unfortunately only later explained what actually was happening to them. Humanity was attacked by a terrible menace, an alien virus called ,,Gastrea''. The virus was sent in by monsters with animal-like behaviour and the most terryfing part is the one hit -certain death, penalty. The reason for the eradication is that we had no anti-bodies to fight the virus - once bitten or just a tiny bit entering our body and the virus would assimilate aggressively. When it has 50 % of the cells under control, the virus will destroy the human shell of a host and thus a new gastrea is born.Next in the plot we see Rentaro in New Tokyo or better the Tokyo District - as those who survived have hidden together in the rest what was left of their cities, these are protected by huge walls made of varanium - a metall that Gastrea despise and thus avoid.Rentaro had found the signs of an infection in the city, but is yet greeted by a misterious masked man - calling upon that he would bring destruction to the world. Rentaro was unfortunately defeated as his partner Enju arrives but likely they found the infested citizen. Here comes the tricky part then, which makes me kind of angry and confused everytime i come over it. Humanitys' last Hope are the cursed children. You hear that the gastrea virus was passed down over the mouth into pregnant women and instead of taking over the body it deeply hardened in the cells of the child. Those childs gain red eyes and superhuman abilitys to destroy the other gastrea.The fucked up thing i had with that is that those children are treated like trash. They live in slums and only the least citizen treat them like actual humans - except the promoter and even those have some a**holes in them. You get a really hard example, where a young girl had blinded herself by bleaching her eyes, just to be excepted by the other humans. What you deal with is no light anime, but one that deals with heavy questions like:- How can you survive?- How do you treat your friends?- What ideals will you stand for?- Can you accept one of them, or can you stand being one of them?As you see, the story can be really astonishing and confusing- if you want to watch it then you have to keep on. The art is quite fascinating, the gastrea are well made and terrifying to see, though i may have wished for some drawn versions instead of CGI ones here and there. Sound instead is very spot on, you will feel pumped and sometimes also scared. The op , sung by fripside is very fitting to the anime universe. It shows a dedication to a well thought out plot and invites you to let you immerse yourself.Unfortunately due to the fast paced plot, much of the information had to be squished in a thus much other characters have been left as cameos and are not even nearly explained, which is disappointing. Though it having a lot of flaws, i had great fun with it and kept on watching.Given the respective points, i have calculated the score based on story- sound , art and characters and my personal enjoyment which is why im am issuing the series a 7.6 which rounds up to 8.It is unfortunately opinionated, you can not definetly say ,,Watch it, you definetly are gonna like it.''I personally advice you to at least give it a try.

Anime club was supposed to be more than watching stuff, but because the original leaders graduated, things went downhill from there, but I don't have any regrets watching Black Bullet. I was obsessing over it for months afterwards because I forgot the title of it until I saw it on Crunchyroll (Heaven bless you). It may be true that the dystopian society obsessed with killing mysterious monsters who can turn human beings into monsters isn't so original, but if my friends know anything else about me, it's that...I love anything dystopian (Except the Hunger Games, and they call it art?). Normally, the monster thing would creep me out, but the whole concept glued my eyes to the TV screen. Despite being grossed out sometimes, the whole concept gets a full score from me.Art: It's clear that Black Bullet has more of a male audience focus because of how techy and dark the anime can get. In fact, everything in atmosphere is just gigantic and bold. The characters may not have as bold of features, but you can tell at every moment exactly how each character is feeling just by looking at them. Plus, just how mechanical Rentaro's metal limbs are just amazes me and makes me remember how cool anime is. Plus, the fact people can tell who the Cursed Children are by their red eyes just reminds you that this is a sci-fi dystopian story. It does get bloody, and you can just know when it's going to happen, too, because the art actually foreshadows everything. But still, I'm in love with it, and I'm a female. I know girls who are obsessed with the show and want a season two of it already. This section gets a full voting score.Sound: This is the first anime that I've watched in which I love both opening and ending theme songs. The opening is catchy, but it's catchy to the point where it doesn't get so annoying compared to the Ouran opening theme. As the opening explains what goes on in the series, the ending just reminds you that the story is all about Enju in all honesty because the whole war with the monsters vs the humans affects her the most. Putting Enju clips at the end just makes people's hearts sink into their stomaches. I know my heart did that. Overall, this portion also deserves a 10.Character: There are four characters in the series who stand out to me most of all, two of them being the main characters of the show. When the monsters first attacked Rentaro's country, he was fatally injured and his mentor's doctoral skills saved his life. For those fifteen years, he was only focused on killing those who killed his family. His partner, Enju, is an orphaned Cursed Child and Rentaro was her only friend (and for some strange reason, not really lover. The crush thing? What the fuck is that? I mean I know little girls have crushes on older guys as a more fan base thing, but Enju wants to marry Rentaro and have his children, which is fucking scary to me). After learning of Enju's backstory, you tend to feel very sorry for her since she didn't do anything wrong. Cursed Children in Rentaro's society are the equivalent to the blacks before and during the civil rights movement, the majority just want them gone. Kisara was so badass. She knows what she wants, and no one is going to stand in her way, not even when Rentaro is so appealing. Ever since I saw those two together, I wanted them to get together. Then, realizing that this is a dystopia we are talking about, I found it very unlikely. The end proved me right (You will have to find that out for yourselves because I'm not telling you want happens). The end of the season just made me hate her, and with good reason, too. Though Tina Sprout is not considered a main character, I just felt guilty and hatred for her all at the same time. When I first met her, I thought she just wanted to destroy Rentaro and Kisara all together. No. The more she hung out with Rentaro and Enju, the more she wanted to do good in society, the more she wanted to keep Rentaro and Enju safe. Inside, Tina has a good heart. That's why I love her so much. Just because I don't like some characters, doesn't mean that this portion gets a lower score. To be fair, I drew a 9 out of 10.Enjoyment: I didn't want to stop watching this show when it was close to midnight. The gut-wrenching events and epic battle scenes just have you glued onto your computer screen. Do I want a second season? Yes, and I hope they make it because I want to see more of Rentaro so bad. Great characters, epic story, and brilliant effects just give this whole thing another perfect 10.Overall: This anime didn't get a perfect 10, but after doing the math, I had to round it up, so overall, it did by default. This is based off of my opinion. If you don't like it by the end of the day, fine. However, if you're tired of watching shojo or robots fighting each other, Black Bullet is a must see. You will get just as addicted as I did. I love anything dystopian (Except the Hunger Games, and they call it art?). Normally, the monster thing would creep me out, but the whole concept glued my eyes to the TV screen. Despite being grossed out sometimes, the whole concept gets a full score from me.Art: It's clear that Black Bullet has more of a male audience focus because of how techy and dark the anime can get. In fact, everything in atmosphere is just gigantic and bold. The characters may not have as bold of features, but you can tell at every moment exactly how each character is feeling just by looking at them. Plus, just how mechanical Rentaro's metal limbs are just amazes me and makes me remember how cool anime is. Plus, the fact people can tell who the Cursed Children are by their red eyes just reminds you that this is a sci-fi dystopian story. It does get bloody, and you can just know when it's going to happen, too, because the art actually foreshadows everything. But still, I'm in love with it, and I'm a female. I know girls who are obsessed with the show and want a season two of it already. This section gets a full voting score.Sound: This is the first anime that I've watched in which I love both opening and ending theme songs. The opening is catchy, but it's catchy to the point where it doesn't get so annoying compared to the Ouran opening theme. As the opening explains what goes on in the series, the ending just reminds you that the story is all about Enju in all honesty because the whole war with the monsters vs the humans affects her the most. Putting Enju clips at the end just makes people's hearts sink into their stomaches. I know my heart did that. Overall, this portion also deserves a 10.Character: There are four characters in the series who stand out to me most of all, two of them being the main characters of the show. When the monsters first attacked Rentaro's country, he was fatally injured and his mentor's doctoral skills saved his life. For those fifteen years, he was only focused on killing those who killed his family. His partner, Enju, is an orphaned Cursed Child and Rentaro was her only friend (and for some strange reason, not really lover. The crush thing? What the fuck is that? I mean I know little girls have crushes on older guys as a more fan base thing, but Enju wants to marry Rentaro and have his children, which is fucking scary to me). After learning of Enju's backstory, you tend to feel very sorry for her since she didn't do anything wrong. Cursed Children in Rentaro's society are the equivalent to the blacks before and during the civil rights movement, the majority just want them gone. Kisara was so badass. She knows what she wants, and no one is going to stand in her way, not even when Rentaro is so appealing. Ever since I saw those two together, I wanted them to get together. Then, realizing that this is a dystopia we are talking about, I found it very unlikely. The end proved me right (You will have to find that out for yourselves because I'm not telling you want happens). The end of the season just made me hate her, and with good reason, too. Though Tina Sprout is not considered a main character, I just felt guilty and hatred for her all at the same time. When I first met her, I thought she just wanted to destroy Rentaro and Kisara all together. No. The more she hung out with Rentaro and Enju, the more she wanted to do good in society, the more she wanted to keep Rentaro and Enju safe. Inside, Tina has a good heart. That's why I love her so much. Just because I don't like some characters, doesn't mean that this portion gets a lower score. To be fair, I drew a 9 out of 10.Enjoyment: I didn't want to stop watching this show when it was close to midnight.

This drastically lowered my expectations and I almost never watched it, but i just couldn\'t get passed the idea of the whole promoter/initiator partners concept. So I gave it a shot. Looking back now I actually wonder if I saw the same show as everyone else. Not to say anyone\'s opinion was wrong, I was just so impressed with Black Bullet that I didn\'t see the drastic negatives many others did.The story takes place about 16 years or so...in the future, in a world where humanity has been exiled into small safe territories by evil creatures called the Gastrea. The story focuses on Rentaro, a young civil officer who\'s job it is to fight and kill gastrea that manage to make their way into the Tokyo Area. His partner is a young girl named Enju, who is known as a ""Cursed Child"", which is a child born of a woman who was injected/impregnated with the venom of a gastrea. A new powerful Gastrea threat appears and both Rentaro and Enju, along with many others, must work together to prevent human extinction.Just to get it out of the way,Animation quality: I thought it was great. so yeah. the dark colors emphasized the dark intense atmosphere of the anime.Music: good (mostly in terms of its intense OP and beautiful ED)The plot as a whole, although some could argue it bears a resemblance to Attack on Titan, is actually very unique and interesting. I don\'t think this story can\'t be categorized as simply as ""humans vs Gastrea"" because one major conflict throughout the show is the relationship between normal people and the Cursed Children. Now even though along side human partners it\'s the cursed children who are risking their lives to kill gastrea, they aren\'t accepted by society because they have gastrea blood in them. The general public treat them cruelly, and don\'t allow them to be a part of normal society. This bodes the question for the viewer ""who really are our main protagonists fighting for? Is this even worth it?""  it provides emotional and mental conflict for both the characters and us viewers, and that makes the story that much better. Although the anime is very serious and... sad, it has it\'s light air of relief comedy in the relationship between Rentaro and Enju and other cursed children, who all want to marry him, which is adorable (because it\'s not meant to be taken seriously by the viewer, if you do, then you\'re watching the show wrong... it\'s not a loli harem). It\'s very enjoyable.One unfortunate negative thing to point out is the plot did feel a little rushed, which I wish wasn\'t the case. I think some things could have been more properly elaborated on and explained. What would have made this show better to me is if it had been say 22-24 episodes spanning this exact same plot line. Then the pacing at times wouldn\'t have felt so rushed and information you need to know wouldn\'t have felt sort of thrown in your face at times. Do I think that messed up the anime as a whole? nah. It just prevented us from being able to further appreciate the story.As a whole I genuinely thoroughly enjoyed this anime specifically due to it\'s interesting and heartbreaking action packed plot and it\'s plethora of unique and like-able characters (even the main antagonist is awesome.)Even if it was too short to have 100% accurately adapted itself from it\'s light novel, I still believe Black Bullet is worth a watch. It\'s highly entertaining, emotionally gripping, and full of good quality action. However if you read the LN and are an absolute stickler for adaptation accuracy, then steer clear because you\'ll just end up all upset. in the future, in a world where humanity has been exiled into small safe territories by evil creatures called the Gastrea.

Despite its idea to follow the safe route in storyline which left it comparable to a lot of other anime, it still allows you to enjoy the show with each character unique traits and designs.The anime is filled with side characters and villains which give the show a lot of fight scenes where each fighting style is different, this provides a good interest point. I recommend you try the first few...episodes for yourself to decide ^_^ episodes for yourself to decide ^_^', 'I want to love this anime so much. It has a lot of potential but I feel it could had been handled better. Despite that I really enjoyed it.STORY: People have compared this with Attack on Titan and its not hard to see why. Civilization has closed itself off from an outside threat which threatens to consume every person. That\'s the overall plot, each individual arc was interesting. My one problem is that it feels like it could had been so much more. I never read the LN so I don\'t know exactly how much story there was available to adapt from. Just by...extending it to a 24 episode season could had helped so much. To gradually see the relationships and bonds grow would had made all the struggles and difficult choices each character had to make have more of an impact. It is still very enjoyable, I simply found myself thinking ""I would had liked to have seen how they first met"" oftenART: Art style plays a major role for me. For the most part I really liked it in this series. The characters look great, fights are carried out well enough. I also like the imaginative enemies they come up with. Its nothing spectacular, but very few are. I\'m normally not a fan of cg animation, but it was rarely used and well done when it was.CHARACTERS: This is where to me, the anime excelled at. The main protagonist is interesting, entertaining. His loli partner is cute and funny plus also quite the fighter. Every character plays a role. Towards they end they seemed to throw a couple characters into the mix. Not much of a backstory for them. That isnt really a bad thing since you\'ll mostly be caring about the main characters anyway.OVERALL: I enjoyed it a lot, though the end did feel a bit rushed. The small twist a certain character had in the end felt really forced and out of nowhere. Don\'t go in expecting a deep and detailed story. Just watch it for what it is, a interesting, funny when it can be, heartbreaking when it has to story. If you haven\'t read the LN definitely watch it. If you have read the ln.....maybe just stick with the story you have in your mind extending it to a 24 episode season could had helped so much.

Basically is about these two partners Enju and Rentarou who are part of ""Civil Service"". the ""Civil Service"" are partners who are called when there is a Gastrea. Why do they focus on these specific partners? Well lets just say Rentarou is not your ordinary HS student. There is also the problem with the...Cursed Children (which if you watch the anime you will find out what I mean). The story has many different mini stories within it (like with Tina, Midori, etc). The twist at the end is definitely something to look forward to as well. The story also consist of very dramatic sad scenes as well as action packed scenes and the usual comedy in between. the only flaw was that the story may have been a little rushed at times.Art- 9Personally, I liked the art. However, it sometimes really depends on which type of animation you like. But they were really adorable at times. A character that\'s really known for cuteness is Tina Sprout.Sound- 9I absolutely loved the ending and the opening was nice as well. The OST when fighting was amazing really suited the mood. The sad scenes I wouldn\'t say the OST was the best of all time but it was nice and it did go with the mood. The OST was well suited for the scenes chosen.Character-7There were many different type of characters. Rentarou the badass, Enju always going after Rentarou, Tina the cute type, Hiruko and her ""Papa"" the crazy type, and many more. Each character was different from the other and it was enjoyable to see new characters with different personas each time. Never got tire of meeting them.Enjoyment-10The anime was very enjoyable it had action as well as many surprises and sometimes comedy. It totally left a mark on me especially the ending.

Overall I do really enjoy the story that it gives. From just the first ep. it really draw me into watching it was just like BOOM BOOM THIS...AND THAT, if you know what I mean.Art 10any anime with good quilaty art i give it an easy 10Sound 9I love the opening, but some music sounds really dark o_o. Voice actress seems to fit every character too.Character 10I love how every Character is quite different from another. The cursed child are all different from another too. What I always love to see is character development and where the story would take them. All the character has a good bond with each other. I found myself really feeling bad for the cursed child for what they went through and I pretty much just LOVE THEM. I did wish we get to learn a lot more about the characters, we only get to learn a certain amount about them.

I went into Black Bullet with no prior expectations (since I had no idea of it's origins - manga/light novel etc.) and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't really addicted to it either. I rated it an 8/10 but in actuality it would...probably be closer to a 7.5/10.Story (9/10):The story, in my opinion, was quite intriguing. The anime is set in a time where the humans have just been invaded by Gaustrea and is set showing the aftermath of the war. The story revolves around a civil officer named Rentaro and his partner Enju and their experiences as they live out their daily lives as survivors of the war.The background on the Gaustrea is that only objects (swords, bullets etc) made out of Vanadium can do any decent amount of damage to them. The only other 'weapon' humans can utilize are 'cursed' children who are born with Gaustrea-type powers (like insane strength).Art (9/10):I quite enjoyed the art-style in this anime, it was easy on the eyes to watch.Sound (7/10):The voice acting throughout the anime was rather average, there were only a few characters who really had their personalities emphasized through the voice acting were the masked man (Hiruko Kagetane) and Tina Sprout. The music used helped enhance the experience but there were no outstanding sound-tracks.Characters (8/10):While non of the main characters really struck me as 'interesting', some of the side ones had quite the impression. Most notably, the masked man caught my attention and had an mysterious personality. Also, some of the 'cursed' children you could sympathize with as they portrayed their emotions pretty well.Enjoyment (7/10):Like I said already in my conclusion, the story was cool but the execution wasn't as great. I felt as if I should've enjoyed it more then I had done.Overall (8/10):Neither unenjoyable nor 'The Void' worthy (see my explanation on my profile about how I rate my anime if you don't know what 'The Void' is), an equilibrium found somewhere between the 2. probably be closer to a 7.5/10.Story (9/10):The story, in my opinion, was quite intriguing.

Well I'm not here to talk about the other crappy adaptions but here to talk about Black Bullet the anime so here we go.Story: Here we have the story of Satomi Rentarou a young promoter in a civil security agency headed by his childhood friend. A world over run by monsters called gastreas who threaten the world as they know it and want to just kill all the humans cause otherwise there wouldn't be a story. Also we have a bunch of bad...ass lolis with super powers that help out our young hero and the other promoters that you sometimes see. Don't forget though that everyone but the civil security people despise the lolis because fuck them I don't care that they are constantly saving our world but they have some gastrea blood in them thats slowly melting them away so they are bad guys too so fuck them.The story all though very rushed in the anime is good but often gets held back and never really gets as dark as it does in the manga and LN possibly because the budget was low so only had 13 episodes which defiently wasn't enough for this story to shine and also is constantly over shadowed by the said lolis and all the other women that flock towards Satomi.Art: The art in the anime is to say the least is very bright and colorful and really displays the choas and depravity of humanties last stand and is also very moe-y. HAHA but in all seriousness it seems like the artists for this anime didn't even look at the art from the LN or manga and just decided to go with what they saw would make all the cute girls and lolis look good.Sound: I can say that the OP and ED were good but the sounds of the guns and everything else seemed like they just copied and pasted the same sounds and were like yes no one will notice how low this budget was and that we spent it all on the OP and ED.Character: I'm only going to talk about Satomi Rentarou here because he seems to be the only character that the staff really cared about in this anime and the only one who got in character put into them. So we have Satomi Rentarou who at the very beginning of this story as any typical shonen protag would have it had his parent killed by the gastrea and then shouts out that hes going to kill them all (not really was just poking fun because of same VA as SnK's Eren) then he sets of to become a promoter for this company that his childhood friend and sweet heart set up and teams up with very own loli who he tries not to touch throughout the series. He learns that the world isn't all that great as it used to be and that everyone seems to be an asshole and wants to kill his loli sidekick and all her friends and that the world his is protecting might not even be worth protecting and all that typical shonen stuff that protags seem to go through. All that said I find him to be interesting to say the least but just typical and but better than all the other characters in this anime.Also to say it here he and everyone else gets better development in the LN and manga so go read them.Enjoyment: I got some enjoyment out of watching this slaying of a favorite series of mine just cause I kind of forced myself not to hate it in case one day by the grace of the anime lords they decide to re boot it and do it correctly I would say that I stuck by it and enjoyed it.Overall I know it seems like I bashed it throughout this review but in all honesty I feel like as a fan of this series I was betrayed that the animators and staff just threw this half assed work at me and were like enjoy it and cut out a bunch of interesting characters and cut out major fight scenes and just expected everyone to roll with it. I'm giving it an 8 only because I feel like even though it was a pretty bad adaption it wasn't the worst and certainly wasn't terrible but could have been 20 times better if done correctly.In saying the least I would say watch this but don't expect anything ground breaking and if you read the LN and or manga then be prepared to be disapointed.Peace out and enjoy all the anime there is to watch. ass lolis with super powers that help out our young hero and the other promoters that you sometimes see.

I'm giving it an 8 only because I feel like even though it was a pretty bad adaption it wasn't the worst and certainly wasn't terrible but could have been 20 times better if done correctly.In saying the least I would say watch this but don't expect anything ground breaking and if you read the LN and or manga then be prepared to be disapointed.Peace out and enjoy all the anime there is to watch."", 'Oh, another monster of the week show ... oh, sorry, Loli of the week. My bad.The very first true sentence in the show goes ""If you don\'t want to die Rintarou, survive."" Now, here already, I knew this was going to be one hell of a ride.Black Bullet bears a whole lot resemblance to ""Shingeki no Kyojin"", a whole lot more popular counterpart. First and foremost, the main characters are practically identical, both having suffered a terrible tragedy of losing parents, and having one female sidekick by their side, all the time. The reason why this doesn\'t work as well in Black Bullet...is because we literally get 5 seconds montage of how they met, and ... well, that\'s about it. Secondly, their relationship might be disturbing. Remember - Enju is ten years old and she oftentimes says incredibly obvious sexual remarks as well as constantly hit on our main character. But let\'s stick to the story for now.You have the main plot in the synopsis, so I\'ll dwell a bit deeper. The story is composed of short arcs, each having a new enemy our main duo (trio, quadro ---?) must face. One thing you must know about the story is that it\'s EXTREMELY predictable. It quite literally goes by textbook when it comes to ""twists"" and the story itself. There\'s this one episode early on where our main character witnesses injustice in his world, where Cursed Children (little girls who embody the wide-spread virus but contain it under 50% ...) are thrown aside as thrash, despite their importance in securing peace within contained area. Then after that there\'s short, unnecessary scene after which comes the meeting of our Bad Guy 1 and our MC, where the Bad Guy 1 asks him: ""Did you ever witness things you would change in this world?"" (paraphrasing). And this isn\'t just one time. This keeps on happening over and over and over again until eventually you literally know what\'s going to happen next. And not next episode, next scene. Also, the story as odd shifts in the tone. It\'s as if the creators weren\'t quite sure whether they\'d go ""true dark"" or ""true light"" so they kind of met it in the middle and ... well, it didn\'t work out well. These shifts feel weird, unnatural, even forced (which they are). The story itself is far from being spectacular: you\'ve probably seen it in dozens of other anime. Main guy and his sidekick are world\'s only hope of salvation. Even though the ""power-ups"", or rather ranking increases, our MC gets are completely unjustified seeing as he\'s exactly the same as he was in the first episode. Oh well, I guess everyone else suddenly just got weaker.Two redeeming parts of this show though are Art and Sound. Art is quite crisp and can be extremely detailed from time to time (CGI is unappreciated though) and I especially liked the ED\'s first 10-15 seconds. First OP is quite good while the second one is just far too generic to care. The soundtrack can be badass in the badass moments but it\'s oftentimes too generic for you to even notice. Voice actors wage from the most annoying pieces of voice on Earth to okayish. Props to the production team.Characters are ... all over the place. Our main character, Satomi Rentarou, is probably the most generic loud-mouth of shounen genre. He\'s like every other. He\'s the embodiment of them all. You\'ll often hear lines such as: ""I WILL SAVE THE WORLD BY MYSELF!"" (caps lock intended) or ""ENJU IS AS MUCH OF A HUMAN AS YOU AND I ARE! WE ARE ALL HUMANS!"" or ""STOP SCREWING WITH ME!"" or ""DON\'T WORRY, I\'LL PROTECT YOU.""Yeah, our MC yells a lot. And I mean A LOT. So, if you\'re into that, good for you but I, personally, find it extremely annoying that every second line character spits out is a scream of sorts.Our other MC, Enju, is ten year old girl with constant thoughts about male-female relationships, weird ideas about how to interact with far older dude and, quite frankly, disturbing remarks about sex. For heaven\'s sake, she\'s TEN YEARS OLD. I\'d understand if you made her look ten, but she looks ten and IS ten. She\'s your classic hyperactive loli who\'s in service of the main dude because he cooks well (no, I swear. According to flashbacks, that\'s the reason). Then we have a lot of other characters (majority of which appeared only in the like last 4 episodes or so). We have Tina, blonde, erm ... clumsy? loli who\'s lost in all sense of that word. Then we have Kisara, our MC\'s love interest. And of course all the cockblockers (gotta have those).All in all, even though cast seems varied and huge and interesting ... it\'s too generic. There\'s no unique spin to the characters, and while you may like some of them due to their quirkiness or humor, they won\'t stick to you so much that you\'d cry if they die. (I crid evri tajm)Black Bullet is a mixed bag. In one hand, you\'ve got pretty decent visuals, fights and animation overall, and the other hand you\'ve got ... well ... mess. It\'s like ""Guilty Crown"" but with far less production value. A lot of characters are annoying, for other you don\'t really care. and even if you find one or two that are likable, chances are they\'ll die or be destroyed.So my final verdict: Flashy flashy, BUT NO MUSTASHY!

The sound is HORRIBLE and absolutely laughable at points but its also really good at others, the weakest point in the series by far.

""loli"" is an abbreviation for ""lolicon"" and lolicon generally means that the character is attracted to underage girls. Rentaro (main) is by no means attracted to underage girls, he thinks of them as little sisters more than anything. I just wanted to say that because if you are anything like me, any anime that is a lolicon you just prefer to stay away from so I just wanted to clear that up.Black Bullet has great characters, plot developement, animation, and it isn\'t sugarcoated or happy go lucky, all around this anime has...impressed me more and more with each preceding episode.

Black Bullet has a good story line, the fight against the monsters, etc., though it's not very much used.The graphics are very good, and really help to show this anime's atmosphere. The sound...Well, also fit the atmosphere, but isn't really that good.The characters, though higly stereotyped, are my favourite part of Black Bullet.First, the main character, Satomi Rentaro, is a classic anime hero, who believes in his friends and who will do everything too win, who will even sacrifice himself, etc. But I still like...him pretty much, cause he's strong and doesn't just sit and watch his Initiator do the job.Enju, his friend and Initiator, is always excited and full of energy, and it is one thing I like the most, because it changes of the sad and pessimistic personnality of many other characters such as Rentaro or Kisara.Tina Sprout, who is at the beginning presented as an ennemy, and then join Rentaro, is my favourite character in Black Bullet. First of all, she's a sniper. She has an excellent eyesight, and tends to live at night. In fact, she's a Cursed Child from an Owl Gastrea. Also, she's - well, strong, obviously - but also very cute, in the way that she doesn't know much of the life and is pretty serious, which makes a good contrast with the over-excited Enju.Conclusion : Black Bullet is a good action anime, but it also makes think a lot about great questions, such as racism or segregation, and having a reason to live, etc. him pretty much, cause he's strong and doesn't just sit and watch his Initiator do the job.Enju, his friend and Initiator, is always excited and full of energy, and it is one thing I like the most, because it changes of the sad and pessimistic personnality of many other characters such as Rentaro or Kisara.Tina Sprout, who is at the beginning presented as an ennemy, and then join Rentaro, is my favourite character in Black Bullet.

Do watch this if you enjoy wish fulfillment where everything just kind of lands in your lap; women swoon for you, you power up without even working 1 second literally for it and no explanation is really given.Some admin told me to watch more of this before writing a review and killed...whatever I had written. The reason why that review was dumped was because I had only watched one episode. Yep thats right. It only takes 1 episode to see how flimsy of a cash in light novel conversion anime this is. What was worse is that the more I watched, the worse it became plot/character/story wise.The story is bad. It jumps around more than Game of Throne does and that jumps around chapter by chapter. The story isn\'t even about the humanity or apocalypse, its about some really egotistical cliche villain who is only there for a few episodes. And about the ""plight of the lolis"" who are considered second class citizens for unexplained reasons other than they have the blood of the virus which enables them to fight back against what almost erased humanity. It isn\'t worth going into the numerous plot holes that these two themes have in this anime. The anime just jumps between the two and adds some crappy twist or intrigue to try and keep it fresh. Just too many logical fallacies, plot holes, and poorly explained plots arcs.The characters are bad and can be described as a whole as ""one size fits all"". MC is a great example of how a large segment of anime watchers love wish fulfillment and enjoy pretending they can be this character who literally has girls falling in love with him with almost zero interaction, as well as suddenly getting super powerful without even trying to train for it (sword art online anyone?). At least Naruto and Luffy do something before getting new moves (MC literally doesn\'t do anything and becomes ultra powerful). The MC is so into fulfilling every different aspect of the ideal character that he even won\'t lay a hand on a guy who clearly was trying to destroy the lolis around him because he was saved. And at the same time he rolls around yelling at people trying to convince them loli\'s are people too. On the female side the first episode introduced 3 women: loli with flatchest, same aged girl with big boobs, mature woman with big boobs to cover all the major bases of the male population. This wouldn\'t be an issue if they had a bigger role besides a few lines a episode if the are lucky. Later on more and more girls are introduced to fill in any missed gaps and in the end they\'re just there to appeal to the male crowd as they all fall in love with the MC (unexplained).Whats good? Art is done well enough. Also if you really like lots of lolis that\'s good too. If you\'re looking for deep interactions with lolis on a frequent basis, there are better animes for those kinds of fetishes though. Also if you like harems, it gets more harem like later on.

So it’s safe to read even if you haven’t watched the show yet.  A lot of you might think Black Bullet is just another Harem story, well, you sir, are correct. And a bit off, too. Why? ‘Cause Black Bullet’s a lot darker than your average shounen-action-series out there.Story: 9Gastrea. Gastreas are freakishly-oversized-insects. They inject their viruses on humans to turn them into one of them. Faced with the threat of being annihilated by these abominations, Civil Securities are made to combat Gastreas. Satomi Rentaro is an initiator and is...a member of Tendo Civil Security. Along with his Promoter, Aihara Enju our main Loli, one of the many “cursed child” (I don’t need to explain this, you’ll be introduced to them early in the show). Together, they are tasked with completing missions given by the higher-ups. That’s basically the gist of the show. Further explanations will result to spoilers, and you don’t want that, right?You might think it’s quite high, no? But 9 is a reasonable score for Black Bullet’s plot, and plot twists, lots of it!Art: 9Like I’ve been saying with my past reviews, “We rarely, most likely, not see any art that’ll disappoint us these days.” Primarily, because of the technology today. It is not a bad thing at all. Most of the shows today are crappy, to tell ya the truth. And guess what their redeeming point is? It’s the effin’ art. A shitty-show with great art will still attract lots of viewers. After all, most of us “Judge the book by its cover”. Well enough with my shitty-ass lecture. Black Bullet deserves a nine in art on every aspect. It has great details on everything. Enough said.Characters: 9Loli(s)!? Loli(s)!? Loli(s)!? LOLITAS EVERYWHERE!!! Yep, 80% of Black Bullet’s world is composed with lolitas. Jk. Although, there are “a LOT” lolitas in the show, which makes me happy! Don’t get me wrong! I am not a lolicon! I swear on me mum (guilty).Jokes aside, Black Bullet’s a harem show. So Rentaro will be flocked on by girls (mostly, little ones). Every character in the show compliments Rentaro’s personality, which is a great thing. Each one of them are drawn perfectly, to supporting casts, to the main characters. No character has been short of personality.Enjoyment: 9I absolutely enjoyed Black Bullet, no sarcasm intended. Or maybe I just enjoyed it because I’ve watched it after watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, I wonder? I enjoyed watching the show. Although, it’s a bit short, it was able to portray where its plot headed to. No episode disappointed me, everything was placed well. The “calm before the storm” episodes were quite heart-warming.  Black Bullet’s story telling impacted a lot on me. I mean, it can make you smile at one episode and it’ll make you feel devastated at the very next one.Overall: 9The fact that Black Bullet is not your typical shounen show which consists only of cliché-one-liners is damn great. Although, a lot might say the show's a bit grim. Reality's fairly grim, too, no? Black Bullet exceeded my expectations. With the way the plot has turned to, with all the plot twists. It fairly deserves a 9! Overall, Black Bullet is a great show. The balance of heart-warming episodes to action-packed scenes are totally great.Ok, I break my promise right here. I’m about to write where I think the plot is heading to. *WARNING* *DO NOT READ IF YOU DON’T WANT TO GET SPOILED*With all the deaths and plot twist that happened in this season, a season two is inevitable, I guess?Black Bullet’s brimming with potential. Yes, I just love protagonists turning into antagonists! With Tendo Kisara’s dark side awakening, I can imagine something big is happening!

It is not a bad thing at all. Most of the shows today are crappy, to tell ya the truth. And guess what their redeeming point is? It’s the effin’ art. A shitty-show with great art will still attract lots of viewers. After all, most of us “Judge the book by its cover”. Well enough with my shitty-ass lecture. Black Bullet deserves a nine in art on every aspect. It has great details on everything. Enough said.Characters: 9Loli(s)!? Loli(s)!? Loli(s)!? LOLITAS EVERYWHERE!!! Yep, 80% of Black Bullet’s world is composed with lolitas. Jk. Although, there are “a LOT” lolitas in the show, which makes me happy! Don’t get me wrong! I am not a lolicon! I swear on me mum (guilty).Jokes aside, Black Bullet’s a harem show. So Rentaro will be flocked on by girls (mostly, little ones). Every character in the show compliments Rentaro’s personality, which is a great thing. Each one of them are drawn perfectly, to supporting casts, to the main characters. No character has been short of personality.Enjoyment: 9I absolutely enjoyed Black Bullet, no sarcasm intended. Or maybe I just enjoyed it because I’ve watched it after watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, I wonder? I enjoyed watching the show. Although, it’s a bit short, it was able to portray where its plot headed to. No episode disappointed me, everything was placed well. The “calm before the storm” episodes were quite heart-warming.  Black Bullet’s story telling impacted a lot on me. I mean, it can make you smile at one episode and it’ll make you feel devastated at the very next one.Overall: 9The fact that Black Bullet is not your typical shounen show which consists only of cliché-one-liners is damn great. Although, a lot might say the show's a bit grim. Reality's fairly grim, too, no? Black Bullet exceeded my expectations. With the way the plot has turned to, with all the plot twists. It fairly deserves a 9! Overall, Black Bullet is a great show. The balance of heart-warming episodes to action-packed scenes are totally great.Ok, I break my promise right here. I’m about to write where I think the plot is heading to. *WARNING* *DO NOT READ IF YOU DON’T WANT TO GET SPOILED*With all the deaths and plot twist that happened in this season, a season two is inevitable, I guess?Black Bullet’s brimming with potential. Yes, I just love protagonists turning into antagonists! With Tendo Kisara’s dark side awakening, I can imagine something big is happening! I just hope Kadokawa won’t make us wait any longer!"", 'Imagine a friend telling you of some mythical anime that is like a combination of Claymore, Darker than Black, Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan, and Elfen Lied with a loli multiplier. You would probably respond with something along the lines of, ""Butter my buns and twist my nipples, I must be asleep because I\'ve had this wet dream before!"" ...That is what I originally thought when I picked this anime up. Let there be an emphasis put on ""originally"".I really, really wanted to love this anime, hell I still do, but that just isn\'t going to happen. See you forgot that your friend telling you...about Black Bullet is a huge dick and he might have forgot to mention to you that this anime also possesses all of SAO\'s worst qualities. The pacing is awful, the story predictable, the power-ups stupefying, the dialogue mind-bendingly atrocious, and the characters shallow. You will be surprised to see that even after that rant I still award Black Bullet a somewhat respectable 7/10, to be honest I am surprised as well. I think that was just the last remnants of me that want to like the anime. With this farce of an intro, I believe it\'s time that I break down the individual areas.Story: 3/10There isn\'t much to be said here. I will admit that the first arc is actually quite good and up to its conclusion I had high hopes for this anime. Then the rest of the anime happened. I almost feel like the staff poured themselves into that first arc and then just didn\'t have anything left to try and make the rest of the story as well. The pacing gets really wonky in the last half. Sometimes things happen/ people die and I\'m pretty sure that the moment is supposed to have some profound emotional impact, but since we just met the characters it barely even registers as a bump in the road. I also feel like ""story"" is an adequate place for me to bitch about the dialogue. Whomever wrote the script needs to be drawn and quartered for cruel and unusual treatment because that dialogue was butchered. If you are watching an anime and are able to guess the next line with greater than 25% accuracy than something is wrong. It was just a wholly uninspired and dull work.Art and Sound: 9/10 and 8/10The art was really pretty and the soundtrack never bothered me. I also liked the OP a bit. The action scenes were executed pretty well also. Both of these categories get thumbs up from me.Character: 5/10Oh let me introduce you to our star-studded cast! We have Cookie Cutter Protagonist""-chan, ""Tsundere Loli""-chan, ""Drinking-that-Lean-Dere Loli""-chan, ""Mysterious Mask""-chan, and last but certainly not least ""Oppai with a Dark Past""-chan. These are literally the only characters you will see enough to even remotely care about and all of them have the most static, boring characteristics-- well with the exception of one and we only learn about that twist near the end from ""Shy Furry Loli""-chan at the end of her thirty seconds of screen time. Which raises another issue of how characters were never allowed much if any screen time if they weren\'t a main. That would have been ok if it wasn\'t for the fact that the creators clearly wanted us to care about these transient characters\' demises.Enjoyment: 7/10Ehhhhhh, I guess at the end of the day I did enjoy this anime. At the very least I wanted to enjoy this anime. When it began I thought this anime might be like a 9, but that was most assuredly not meant to be. I tried to dive into this anime, but it ended up just being a shallow stream. No amount of action and lolis was going to be able to turn around my opinion of this anime... Or can it ??

When it was first announced, I was stoked. The PV made me even more excited when I saw the artwork.I read some of the manga, but as I realized it was nowhere near as far as the LN was, I stopped and figured I might as well just watch the anime instead.Many people see this anime as overrated, which is understandable. I see it that way too. It was hyped up as it came out, and it certainly doesn\'t deserve the hyped it received. The same could be...said about series like Attack on Titan, which I also find to be overrated. So why the high score? I suppose I\'ll tell you.Story: 8The story is similar to Attack on Titan, which is why it\'s compared to it all the time. Basically, the human race is cornered by an extremely powerful mutant species, and they\'re trying their hardest to struggle for survival.The plot here is a bit different, though. The creatures, known as Gastrea, are like zombies in terms of being created by an infected directly implanted into the body. Except, these things are nothing like zombies. Whatsoever. Which is good and bad in it\'s own way. (I\'m sick of zombies, though, there aren\'t many good zombie anime out there.)Anyway, the plot is straight forward with a couple of sidetracks here and there. Usually these sidetracks are to introduce more characters, such as Tina. This can be a good and a bad thing whichever way you see it. I don\'t really mind, so it didn\'t really effect the score. Though the Gastrea aren\'t actually dealt with until near the end.The pacing is fast. Extremely fast. To the point where it may be way too fast for you. The pacing bothered me, but at the same time, I understood that it was necessary, since the plot for Black Bullet is huge and hard to compress into 13 episodes.Other than the pacing and sidetracking, the story wasn\'t very original. There are several series with similar story lines, but I suppose the way it\'s dealt with in this show can be considered ""unique"".When it comes to the ending, though, I was satisfied. I won\'t say anymore because... it may hint some kind of spoiler.Art: 10The art style of this show is fantastic. It\'s fresh, new, and the animation is flawless. Definitely fits the 2014 quality bill. The way the city is portrayed is also perfection, in my eyes. It has a sort of dark sci-fi atmosphere to it. Which is great, because I love those kinds of things.Character designs ranged, from simple and bland to... interesting. I liked some of the children\'s outfits, such as Enju. Characters like Kisara and Rentarou had plain outfits. So on and so forth. Either way, the art is outstanding.Sound: 8There isn\'t really anything stand-out in this section. The soundtrack was good but not worth mentioning. Though, I liked the atmosphere is helped create. The opening is catchy and fits the show well, but the ending... the ending song is amazing. I never skipped the ending song, I could not get enough of it. Beautiful.Character: 8Again, nothing really worth mentioning except for the portrayal of the character\'s feelings and conflicts.For this, my biggest example is Rentarou.After a bit of time, Rentarou actually begins to question why exactly is he even bothering to protect humanity. He\'s noticed how horrible we can be, especially in the treatment of the cursed children. He doesn\'t like or accept the way we treat each other, and begins to hesitate. There\'s also his feelings near the end of the show.He begins to notice that, after the amount of murders and deaths he has witnessed and/or caused, he\'s starting to become used to people dying. It\'s uncomfortable for him, and it would be for anyone, to realize that you basically don\'t care anymore if someone were to die either because or not because of you. This aspect really only appears in the last episode, but the show did a fantastic job growing those feelings up until that point.The relationship between Rentarou and Enju is also something else worth mentioning. Rentarou does his best to give Enju a good life, despite the times their living in. He pulls her away from gory scenes that may effect her mind or lies to her to make her feel better about situation, as any parent would. After a while, there\'s a shift. Really in the end though. Rentarou then turns to Enju, after realizing his feelings for people deaths are weakening, for comfort. An example of this is a scene where he begins to cry, lays his head unto Enju\'s lap and tells her ""Please stay by my side, forever...""It was touching, and it was a relief to see the main character not shy away from getting close to someone like her. If you consider it romantic or not, it\'s your call. I don\'t know what to call it yet.One thing I disliked though was in the end. A certain character has a sudden shift in feelings, apparently turning ""evil"". But why? I don\'t understand the sudden change in emotions. Just before, they were acting fine. Now they\'re evil? Please help me understand!Enjoyment: 9Overall, this is a good series. Actually, I\'ll give it the status of ""just above good"" as in, it\'s not quite at the level of great, but it\'s a little in between.The action scenes are VERY fluid, I may add, the there\'s many unpredictable twists and turns that lead to the deaths of certain characters. Trust me, it\'s not just random, merciless deaths like in Attack on Titan either. I promise.Overall, this series receives an 8/10.If you\'re looking for a sci-fi survival action series with outstanding animation and good action, look no further. It\'s fast-paced, but it\'s definitely entertaining in it\'s own, unique way.(Plus there\'s a lot of emotional scenes that actually had me tearing up, and at one point I found myself crying like a baby, and I wasn\'t really sure why it had effected me so strongly.) said about series like Attack on Titan, which I also find to be overrated.

Every time I looked, I saw mediocre ratings. After reading what pretty much everyone else has to say about this thing, I wasn’t expecting much. I’m glad I gave it a chance.Most shows of roughly this type spend half their first episode spouting expository dialogue (and probably a good portion of the rest as well). Black Bullet lets you pick things up on your own. It contains far less exposition than most anime, and what it uses is well-placed and unobtrusive. If your mood isn’t favoring a brainy show, but...you’d rather do without the spoon-feeding, you’ve probably found the right anime.I can’t think of any point where Rentarou really annoys me as a protagonist. On the contrary, he seems like someone who is genuinely trying to become a better person, even while learning to deal with the cruel realities of his world. In many ways, this show is about his growth as a person.If you ask me to point to the show’s greatest flaw, I’d go right for the harem aspect. It holds the greatest potential for destroying suspension of disbelief. I certainly wouldn’t classify this show as harem genre, but for some reason EVERYONE in this show is enamored of its largely unassuming protagonist. I don’t mean to turn anyone off.

Initially i gave this a 9 when i was at episode 7, but my opinion changed when i finished this series. It met my expectation for a generic shounen show. good, but not excellent.Story: 6Story is the worst part of this anime, not the plot of the anime, the setup was fine and interesting, but the problem with it is the length of the anime. Black Bullet is only 12 episodes long, so there isn't enough time to fit the whole plot and character development. The anime felt very rushed, little to no character development. If it was 24 episodes, this anime would've...been great. And the whole brink of extinction part, the streets and people in the anime feels very safe, doesn't feel like humans that are in the verge of extinction at all.Art: 9Art is outstanding and very beautiful. fighting scenes are animated very well. Art is very consistent throughout the series.Sound: 8Opening song is done by FripSide (who also did Railgun). ED is also good but the theme song is somewhat forgettable.Character: 8Our hero Satomi Rentaro here is not overpowered like other main characters, he is pretty balanced. There is character development but not much because of what I already said, 12 episodes is not enough. And the loli force are very cute and likeable.

Yes, everyone already knows that. But I still have several unexplained questions about them. Why aren\'t any of them older than 10? What leads these Cursed Children to only be girls? Why do a good number of them lust over Rentaro? What the fuck were the writers thinking?!I feel people have mistreated this show. I wouldn\'t consider it bad by any means, certainly not deserving of a 1/10. I also, however, can\'t say that this is a great show.While I personally liked it, I can still tell it is heavily flawed. Lack of...character depth, repeated plot scenarios (really, just two different conflicts being repeated with slight variations), and more, results in Black Bullet\'s noticeable imperfection.Does that mean it\'s bad? No, it\'s still amusing enough to keep you watching. This show, while certainly not as bad as people make it out to be, is nothing new. (I feel like this kind of show\'s already been done, but better) It\'s a relatively normal, post-apocalyptic action anime.

Nothing new in that regard.

Black bullet is not a top 10 series by any means, but very enjoyable nonetheless, and at 13 episodes, why not?', 'Black Bullet is a dystopian science fiction anime featuring little girls.In the year 2021, giant ass parasites called ""Gastrea"" attack a rural village in Japan, killing all in their path. Among the survivors is a boy named Rentaro Satomi\xa0(里見 蓮太郎). 10 years later Rentaro is working for the anti gastrea force known as civil security. Rentaro works for the Tendo civil Security which is owned by Kisara Tendou\xa0(天童 木更). Another member of the Tendo security is 10 year old Enju Aihara\xa0(藍原 延珠), partner of Rentaro. The gastrea have a weakness against a metal called Varanium, which civil security agents make their weapons out of.Believe it...or not, about half the cast are little girls and it\'s not even a lolicon. These little girls, though cute, they are deadly beings known as ""Cursed Children"" because they have the gastrea virus in their little bodies causing them to have red eyes and super powers. Each civil security agent has their own cursed child partner which they are dubbed as Initiators while the human partner is known as the Promoter.The characters in Black Bullet are pretty good, though half are little girls. The lore is pretty cool but lacks an explanation about the gastrea and how the varanium monoliths surrounding the Tokyo area actually work. Each cursed child has a different ability that they use to fight the gastrea. There arent a whole lot of fighting scenes and they\'re not that long but it\'s still entertaining to watch.The art style is really good and the soundtrack is awesome.There are 13 episodes so it doesn\'t take long to finish.

FOR TL;DR SKIP TO “OVERALL” SECTION.]Watching Black Bullet is the equivalent of that kid who is always enthusiastic in school.  He may not be the smartest, but he tries so hard and you just want to give that little guy an A for effort.  Unfortunately, in the real world grades aren’t given for effort but for quality, and that is where Black Bullet fails: it tried to do too much with a plot that ultimately wasn’t going to be anything more than mediocre.STORY- 6/10Oh look, a post-apocalyptic thriller!  Humans are trapped inside a certain area...and there are monsters on the outside that want to try to get in and eat all of us!  I wonder where I’ve heard that before…The main criticism that I have with this anime is that it was rushed.  Extremely rushed, in fact, and it is a damn shame because the story showed a lot of promise as being one of the few light novels that aren’t harems/pretentious otaku-pandering/both.  It’s my personal belief that if this show had gotten 26 episodes, it could have been legitimately well-received.Our story takes place in the 2030s, when a parasitic virus is turning people into monsters called Gastrea.  Humanity has taken refuge in what used to be Tokyo (seriously, did you expect anywhere else?), behind monoliths constructed of an alloy named Varanium that is the Gastreas’ only weakness.  Well, almost.The other way to fight Gastrea is to turn them against each other, and that’s where Cursed Children come in.  They are formed when the Gastrea Virus infects a pregnant woman, and the child is always born a girl, with a human appearance but the powers of a Gastrea.  In response to this, the governments of what’s left of the world formed a civil security system where a Cursed Child, or Initiator, is paired with a human, or Contractor, and they are outsourced to private agencies.  Since they make up the majority of humanity’s defense against the Gastrea, obviously Contractors hold a lot of power in government and society.  However, the Cursed Children aren’t exactly treated the same way.This is where our main character, Rentaro Satomi, comes in, as a low-level Contractor working with his partner, Enju Aihara, employed by the Tendo Agency for his classmate and longtime friend, Kisara Tendo.  Of course, many more interesting, and some not-so-interesting, characters will be met along the way.I’ve heard so many people toss lolicon accusations at this show, but really, it’s not that much loli-pandering.  Sure, Enju does have a crush on Rentaro, but he’s not interested.  However, I can see why people might think this and it might turn them off.I actually thought the story, while a little clichéd, is okay.  However, the problem here is rushing, rushing, RUSHING.  This anime tries to pack as much content as it can in 13 episodes, which leads to it moving too fast to really have much of an impact on the viewers.  That, and a huge “LOLWAT” moment at the end of episode 7 that really left me scratching my head and soured the anime to me.  Thankfully, the anime does pull out a fairly decent conclusion, but overall, the story is middling.CHARACTERS- 4/10Now there’s only going to be so much character development you can get in 13 episodes, but some of the characters manage to be very unlikeable in the time they’re given.  Also, some characters that the audience is supposed to care about don’t get enough screen time to be worth caring about.Rentaro Satomi- Our main protagonist.  The main problem I have with him is that it can’t seem like he knows which hero type he wants to be.  He seems set up to be an anti-hero, but he regularly plays ping-pong with the hero scale, going from traditional hero all the way down to full-on designated hero in a couple instances and sometimes it really gets hard to root for him when he, for instance, threatens to kill a group of civilians for harassing a Cursed Child.  Dick move, people, I agree, but under no circumstances is it justified to end their lives.  He has a decent backstory, but it’s not visited enough.  Overall, not a very heroic character though he does have his good points.Enju Aihara- The Initiator our protagonist is paired with, a nine-year old girl with rabbit characteristics.  She gets a lot of flak for a) being a loli and b) crushing on Rentaro.  I agree that her crush was unnecessary, but I do find her cute, and unlike her partner, she didn’t make me want to punch her in the face like Rentaro did sometimes.  Also, once you find out about her backstory, you’ll have a whole lot more sympathy for her.Kisara Tendo- The owner of the Tendo Civil Security agency and Rentaro’s childhood friend.  Her grandfather saved Rentaro as a little boy when he was about to be killed by a Gastrea.  Her family owns a kenjutsu dojo, and she is incredibly proficient with swords and hand-to-hand combat.  However, most of her family were killed a few years ago, and she has sworn revenge on the killers.  She’s one of my favorite characters, mainly because she has some compelling backstory and I love women who can fight- she even gets to call Rentaro out on his dickery at the end of the series.  The problem I have with her is that she’s pretty much a non-factor to the plot for the first half, and even in the second half she takes a backseat.  She’s there for all of the story, but she’s not much more than there.  There might be hope for her yet as the final episode dropped a major tease with her possibly pulling a heel turn, but with the way this anime was received, I can’t see it getting another season, which is sad because she needs more love.Kagetane Hiruko- The not-villain of the story, he was one of the things that the show got right.  He’s the kind of awesome villain in the mold of Dio Brando: smooth, suave, and charismatic even when he’s exploding police heads.  Did I mention he can fight as well?  Also, he’s got a much closer connection to Rentaro than anyone thinks, and their relationship, from enemies to uneasy allies, gets the most attention than any other interactions in the series save for Rentaro/Enju shenanigans.  Character development done excellently, he was my favorite character of Black Bullet.Seitenshi-sama- The leader of the Tokyo Area Settlement, she is an idealist who would like for humans and Cursed Children to get along.  I liked the political themes her introduction in the story brought into it; unfortunately, apart from her pacifism there’s not much else to her.  Pretty flat character.Tina Sprout- Okay, the first thing I have to say is that I don’t understand why Enju gets bashed and Tina gets praised despite them basically being the same character!  Is it because she’s ‘Murican?  If so, that’s a big double standard, anime fans.  Pausing from my rant to explain her, she is a high-ranked Initiator who is sent to Japan to assassinate Seitenshi, who has just sent her new personal bodyguard Rentaro out to capture her.  I don’t like her very much because she gets defeated in the most shonen-y way ever: after ten minutes of beating Rentaro into a bloody pulp, a flashbang grenade goes off at exactly the right time and he knocks her out with two moves.  That’s it, game over.  What followed next induced my head to meet the wall.  She gets no punishment, despite trying to kill the leader of government not once, but twice!  Huh?  If I sent my little sister to kill the president, it doesn’t matter that she is both cute and following orders, she’d still face life in prison!  How is this any different?  It seems like a cheap attempt to turn Tina good without worrying about the damage she’s caused, or maybe it’s due to the unsettling theory that civil security agents can do whatever the hell they please and no one can do anything about it.  Either way, afterwards she ends up partnering with Kisara and becomes Enju 2.0.  Weak.Takuto Yasuwaki-“Welcome to the Poorly-Written Villain hotline, how may we help you?”“Well, um, I wasn’t really given any motivation for hating the hero.”“You don’t need motivation!  You need to to try to kill that little girl!  The viewers are sure to hate you after that!”“But that little girl just tried to kill our nation’s leader, who I’m sworn to protect.  Wouldn’t that make it justified?”“Then what we’ll do is make you look and act like Nobuyuki Sugou.  That means the viewers will know you’re EEEEEEEEEVIL!”“I thought fans hated that show for all the wrong reasons.”“Screw logic, I’m the director.”‘Nuff said.Miori Shiba- What is her point?  She only shows up a couple times, and the extent of her characterization is “wants Rentaro’s D”.  Seriously, how does she even contribute anything meaningful to the story?Shoma Nagisawa and Midori Fuse- I’m sorry.  I know I’m supposed to care about Midori’s suicide and Shoma’s heroic sacrifice, but no amount of emotion is going to make me give two shits about characters who’ve barely had one episode of screentime.  Also, catgirl, because apparently catgirl!ART- 9/10The art is the one good thing about this anime.  The characters all have distinct designs, the animation moves fluidly, and I didn’t notice all that many off model frames or designs.  Overall, good work by Kinema Citrus, the studio that did Barakamon.  It’s a shame that the story couldn’t match the artwork.MUSIC- 7/10The soundtrack is composed by Shiro Sagisu, the man who did the music for Evangelion.  Unfortunately, this is probably his weakest entry to date, as all the music is utterly forgettable.  It’s not the worst thing he’s composed (looking at you, song that plays when Ichigo powers up) but it’s far from the best and it doesn’t aid the story in any way.OVERALL- 6/10Apparently this show is pretty polarizing, because people either like it or think it’s the worst thing to hit TV since Sword Art Online.  However, I just think it’s mediocre.  While the art is great and the music all right, some elements of the show can alienate the viewers and it’s just too rushed to invoke the kind of emotion it’s supposed to in the readers.  The characters are the weakest point, with some hard to cheer for and others unimportant due to general irrelevancy to the story or lack of screen time.Overall, Black Bullet is an okay show but not a great one.  If you are interested in the franchise, I suggest you check out the light novels first as they are about to be translated into English in order to see if you like the story in the first place, and you should probably stream it on CR as I don’t feel this anime is worth paying $50-80 for. and there are monsters on the outside that want to try to get in and eat all of us!

There are some funny moments as well as sad ones in this anime but the loli moments are in pretty much every episode. Not to give too much away but the amount of cursed children throwing themselves at Satomi and wanting to marry him is a bit too much to not be a loli anime. I would also say it is very anti-climatic. There is always a build up towards Satomi's battle yet it seems to be over...within a very short period of time and whatever he is fighting goes down in one hit.I have spoken rather negatively of Black Bullet but that is just me being critical, after all I am writing a review, but overall this is a highly enjoyable anime. The comedy moments are frequent enough and you always get a new reason to support the hero's. I dare say it is the best anime ever but I feel it is quite good and holds it's own within a very short period of time and whatever he is fighting goes down in one hit.I have spoken rather negatively of Black Bullet but that is just me being critical, after all I am writing a review, but overall this is a highly enjoyable anime.

So, the remaining humans have built a wall to protect themselves from being eaten. Sounds familiar, right? That's why so many comparisons are made to another anime, ‘Attack on Titan’ which in turn hurts this show. I know fans of this show are frustrated with all the comparisons but you can’t deny what’s in front of you. The writers and studio could have turned this into a Futuristic Sci-Fi version of ‘AoT’, something...we haven’t particularly seen but rather settled for a cheap knock off of a popular anime. I’ve compiled a short list of the comparisons between ‘AoT’ and ‘Black Bullet’ at the bottom if you don’t believe me. The writing here is poor which hurts the story, leaving it with many plot holes. For instance, you don’t buy the post-apocalyptic world setting since it’s only mentioned in words and not shown to us. The people and city are hailed in good conditions, food is readily available alongside mechanical upgrades, health check-ups, etc. They mention a war at the beginning which is barely touched upon, the New Human creation group motives are unclear, the monster origins aren’t mentioned either. And while the 1st half of the anime has a somewhat decent story, complete with lots of comedy and fan service; the other half is just downright sour! It totally throws you off balance with its sudden shift, unloading lots of information and just kills your mood and the shows momentum by eradicating most of its comedy and replacing it with dramatic seriousness.So, these monsters can only be killed by special bullets and in comes the MC, Rentarou who’s a combat officer resolved to kill these monsters and exacting his revenge based on what he went through in his past. Whether you want to blame it on an incomplete story or poor writing but the characters are bland and generic. Ren is a generic good guy who’s pretty weak since he loses more than he actually wins. I think the show wants to play him as an underdog despite his superhuman strength and experience in martial arts but it never works cause he’s very forgettable so you don’t care much about what happens to him! Enju, a cursed child is another MC who’s under Rentarou’s care. Cursed children are depicted as monsters in society for their ability to inherit and display powers. Enju gets little growth of her own, residing as only a love struck loli. There are some good human moments throughout the show but they are poorly handled so you forget about them quickly. Like in the beginning, Enju hates her kind and distrusts Rentarou but in a span of 1 year, she completely does a 180 and we never get to see it! Very essential character change was omitted which could have easily been accomplished in 1 backstory filled episode. Kisara happens to be another love interest, or so we thought, with crazy katana skills whose biggest contribution to this anime are her fan service moments with Ecchi jokes and scenarios. She does get her own identity towards the end which happens at the cost of a potential romance but unfortunately, it’s too late to care. Like why the hell will I take her seriously now when all she’s done until the end is fawn all over the MC and deliver only fan service to us! The main villain is the most interesting character, both mysterious and sinister, yet his reasons for villainy is ridiculous and he came across as a weak impersonation of V from the movie ‘V for Vendetta’!The art work from the character looks to their facial expressions are fine, though they do stand out during battles. During a character’s special move, you should feel all the hype which the art style delivers but unfortunately there’s no excitement in any of them. This applies especially to the MC who has the annoying habit of crying out long ass names for his Kung Fu moves every time during a fight which is very anticlimactic and stupid! The monsters looked pretty neat with the lights emitting from them but then the CGI completely ruins all the hard work! The OP is surprisingly catchy, though not special enough to remember after a while. And the rest of the OST is pretty much a dud! The voice acting for the subs were better here than the dubs, I particularly liked Yuki Kaji’s work on Rentarou. Yuki managed to come across as a genuine high school kid which I appreciated.In conclusion, the story was very rushed, I feel this anime would have benefited from 24 episodes run time. Now either the show didn’t respect its audience or they really had no idea what theme to pick, in my opinion balance is the name of the game and often the problem of this anime. I wouldn’t mind a remake if it’s done properly! But stop with the plot holes and copying off ‘AoT’. Rather make it your own story without rushing integral character arcs and set a concrete tone for the show. It can still be enjoyed as a popcorn flick anime where you shut off your mind and enjoy what’s in front of you.!!!!! CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!!!These comparison points were collected from the Internet:1. The world building is such where gigantic monsters live and eat humans for pleasure/hunger.2. Both the Mc loses their mother by the said monster so they are hell bent on revenge.3. Huge walls were created to block out the monsters, making the humans safe for a while.4. But then this 1 huge monster manages to break the wall and other monsters enter the city and starts eating the humans.5. Both the MC’s go through their own body modification to help them fight better hence becoming one of the top fighters of their group.6. Both MC’s fight alongside a girl who has no parents but was saved by the MC at some point in the past so now she has undying affection for the MC.7. Both shows feature a hot albeit weird scientist who are very interested in the monsters and the MC.8. Both MC’s come up with a reason to go across the wall and fight the monsters.So here you have it! The comparisons are too many to ignore and really sucks out the fun from ‘Black Bullet’ especially if you have watched ‘AoT’ and loved it! we haven’t particularly seen but rather settled for a cheap knock off of a popular anime. I’ve compiled a short list of the comparisons between ‘AoT’ and ‘Black Bullet’ at the bottom if you don’t believe me. The writing here is poor which hurts the story, leaving it with many plot holes. For instance, you don’t buy the post-apocalyptic world setting since it’s only mentioned in words and not shown to us. The people and city are hailed in good conditions, food is readily available alongside mechanical upgrades, health check-ups, etc. They mention a war at the beginning which is barely touched upon, the New Human creation group motives are unclear, the monster origins aren’t mentioned either. And while the 1st half of the anime has a somewhat decent story, complete with lots of comedy and fan service; the other half is just downright sour! It totally throws you off balance with its sudden shift, unloading lots of information and just kills your mood and the shows momentum by eradicating most of its comedy and replacing it with dramatic seriousness.So, these monsters can only be killed by special bullets and in comes the MC, Rentarou who’s a combat officer resolved to kill these monsters and exacting his revenge based on what he went through in his past. Whether you want to blame it on an incomplete story or poor writing but the characters are bland and generic. Ren is a generic good guy who’s pretty weak since he loses more than he actually wins. I think the show wants to play him as an underdog despite his superhuman strength and experience in martial arts but it never works cause he’s very forgettable so you don’t care much about what happens to him! Enju, a cursed child is another MC who’s under Rentarou’s care. Cursed children are depicted as monsters in society for their ability to inherit and display powers. Enju gets little growth of her own, residing as only a love struck loli. There are some good human moments throughout the show but they are poorly handled so you forget about them quickly. Like in the beginning, Enju hates her kind and distrusts Rentarou but in a span of 1 year, she completely does a 180 and we never get to see it! Very essential character change was omitted which could have easily been accomplished in 1 backstory filled episode. Kisara happens to be another love interest, or so we thought, with crazy katana skills whose biggest contribution to this anime are her fan service moments with Ecchi jokes and scenarios. She does get her own identity towards the end which happens at the cost of a potential romance but unfortunately, it’s too late to care. Like why the hell will I take her seriously now when all she’s done until the end is fawn all over the MC and deliver only fan service to us! The main villain is the most interesting character, both mysterious and sinister, yet his reasons for villainy is ridiculous and he came across as a weak impersonation of V from the movie ‘V for Vendetta’!The art work from the character looks to their facial expressions are fine, though they do stand out during battles. During a character’s special move, you should feel all the hype which the art style delivers but unfortunately there’s no excitement in any of them. This applies especially to the MC who has the annoying habit of crying out long ass names for his Kung Fu moves every time during a fight which is very anticlimactic and stupid! The monsters looked pretty neat with the lights emitting from them but then the CGI completely ruins all the hard work! The OP is surprisingly catchy, though not special enough to remember after a while. And the rest of the OST is pretty much a dud!

I do.)Its in the line of recommendable and not recommendable animes.I would recommend it to those lovely people who likes animes that try for something new and not your  basic generic anime.The Final episodes is emitting Sequel bait so hard for another Season and I say give it a chance.I\'m not that hype but I would still watch its mainly because They constructed the story in Season one and I\'m hoping they fix their pacing in the next season.This is also my First review :)) called Varanium which the Gastrea is weak to for your information.To construct a huge black varanium monolith to fend off Gastreas from entering their city.That\'s the main plot and its definitely an interesting one.Art 7/10: The art is good and not the best this season but its still pretty good.I personally think the art has settled itself in my heart and Its a good fit for the story\'s lightly dark story.Sound 10/10: This is where Black bullet excels.Its very well done The opening and Ending are absolutely fantastic that I would watch it over and over again just to hear and see its eye candy animation.The OST at the course of the anime is Super good and Well placed as the story progresses there\'s never a moment where the OST failed to place itself accordingly with each given situations.Character 5/10: Enter Rentaro.The Protagonist you\'re generic hero with the heart of justice even at the moments of chaos.There\'s a lot of characters that will be introduced as you watch the anime,Each with their own personality that the audience each will have their own favorites and hated characters.Enju is the Initiator of Rentaro and tries too hard to be likeable and its annoying at times but not at the point that you will hate her along the way.This is highly paced that you don\'t care about the characters dying because they introduce and kill them off.At that point you just go Meh.Enjoyment 6/10:  6 is Too much even for this anime but I personally Enjoyed it mainly because its not one of those Generic animes we get every season.The action scenes are pretty fast that you will yell ""THAT\'S IT!?""(Fast paced) and Important supposedly tear jerking deaths seems like its coming out of nowhere because its (Fast paced) it may seem like pointless killing at first glance but When you try to understand it.It makes sense that those deaths are important potential development for the characters in the anime but because everything is (Fast faced) you just don\'t care.Even the characters seems like they don\'t give a S- at all.One minute everyone is sad and depressed then the next minute they put on their happy face then the next minute they\'re serious.(Fast paced) this is my face at the end of this anime :l .Overall 6/10: I\'m a generous guy and it should have been 5 at best and I\'m gonna rant again that Rushed pacing is unforgivable.This is an anime adaptation of a Light novel that goes by the same name and I\'m now completely 99% sure its better than its anime counterpart.The LN has probably better pacing and Emotions would make sense in each situations.(Someone confirmed it for me and the LN is actually better WHO KNEW?

Most anime I watch is straight forward Shonen action shows. So I walked into Black Bullet expecting that and got a pleasant surprise. Despite the hate it gets from a lot of people Black Bullet is a enjoyable, fun, and refreshing show for me. It's not a moe, slice of life pandering anime thats been common. It's characters are fun, it's animation is amazing and colorful and the soundtrack is great. Kagetane, played by Rikiya Koyama is amazingly good and in general it's a good, fun,...and solid anime. and solid anime."", 'To start, Black Bullet is NOT a loli-harem. Contrary to a lot of other reviews, this series didn\'t have a single sexual scene, and there was only one truly suggestive joke throughout the whole thing, in which the main character was absolutely horrified at the idea. There is nothing wrong with having a lot of younger characters, and I actually thought it was exciting and new. They acted like real little girls; they had adorable personalities, childish ambitions (like wanting to grow up to marry a person they admire and look up to), and reacted they way most children truly would if put into some...of the situations they did.It was not, in any way, a harem. Harem anime have girls throwing themselves at the main character, constantly trying to seduce him, and usually lots of panty shots and boob jokes. This anime had absolutely none of that, these characters wanted nothing sexual at all.The main character truly loved some of the younger characters, but in a purely family oriented ""older-brother"" way.Story: 7/10Okay now that that\'s out of the way, on to the story. I thought it was great. It might be a little cliche, but they made it work. I think one of the biggest problems in Sci-Fi shows like this one is that nothing is ever very ""scientific"", or based on any evidence from the story\'s universe. But in this show, most everything about the virus was really well explained, or at least had some sort of theory behind it. And if it wasn\'t, it was something the characters (or the society itself) was investigating. Personally, I think that\'s what makes shows like this. I love the theories and thought put into each scenario.They did a great job of not being too repetitive and having the exact same problem re-occur again and again, but also kept a balance from things being too ironic. I dislike when one thing is solved, but then another completely random problem just so happens to start up immediately afterward, and then again, ect. ect. It was decently paced, for an anime with a ton of potential packed into just 13 episodes. Keeping that time frame in mind, it was a pretty unpredictable show. Even though it was moving pretty quickly, you still couldn\'t really tell who would die next or whether their plan would actually work.And as always, I appreciate an anime that\'s not afraid to actually kill characters, rather than have them narrowly escape death time and time again.Art: 8/9The art in this show wasn\'t anything flashy, but I greatly appreciate a nice, simple style. The art they used fit nicely with the used CG for all the Gastrea, as well.The animation was good. Like the art, it\'s not anything to rave about, but the fight scenes definitely looked pretty cool, and the characters had great body language. Especially Enju, she looked like such a child when she ran around or got upset, and it really helped build her character.Sound: 8/10A lot of people say the OP sounds a lot like the OP from Attack on Titan, and having not watched that anime I can\'t really argue in any direction. But I will say I really liked the music used throughout the entire series, and the OP will definitely be going into my iTunes.The voice acting was great. I felt like the voices really suited the characters. None of them had annoying voices, which is a problem you tend to run into a lot in anime. However, I think the best part about it was that you could really hear the emotions in the voices. Some of the tear jerking scenes really hit you hard, they did such a good job making the voices sound so realistic to the situations. Especially Enju\'s screams/crying.Character: 8/10Along with their voices, these characters were so great! They really fit into the story, and their designs were super nice. All the little girls were so cute, and even the ones that were just in the backgrounds had really unique designs. You could tell thought was put into even the random background characters, and I thought that was pretty cool.Black Bullet also didn\'t follow the typical personality tropes. The characters had pretty distinct personalities that didn\'t fall under ""cookie-cutter"" categories.As rare as it is, almost all of the characters in this show, including the villains actually, were pretty likable. I love love Enju. She was so cute, and unlike a lot of shows with younger characters, she truly acted her age. Rentarou was great as well. It is so refreshing to watch an anime where the main male character isn\'t a whiny baby that yells a lot when he accidentally touches boobs (all. the. time.) and can\'t keep his emotions together in a battle. Rentarou was a strong, kind, and determined male protagonist, and I loved him.Character development was really the only weak point in the characters. But I can\'t really blame them, it\'s hard to smoothly transition a character in only 13 episodes. Honestly, if they had tried much harder it probably would have come off really forced. Here\'s to hoping for a second season so we can really see those characters changing!Enjoyment: 9/10I really did enjoy this show. It kept you wanting to know what happened next.

I don\'t know what else to say here honestly...  I definitely would recommend it!Overall: 8/10', ""Black Bullet was a short (for how much it engaged me) enthralling affair. In terms of story it was told in a very different way than usual. It concentrates on certain small interactions which, when seen holistically, are quite well put while using plot twists and big reveals (though a bit predictable) as anchors to show its progression. Seen in how the story is about Humans vs creatures called Gastrea, and yet most of the anime centers on the human aspect and their interactions more. This will not of course go well with everyone as it sometimes seems a bit disjointed and rushed, as though...they are skipping some potentially epic points, though I can forgive this as Black bullet proves that the journey truly is better than the destination at times.In terms of Art and sound I would say they did not bore me because i know nothing about appreciating such, i usually just watch for story and characters.In terms of the characters I found that they were all well written and they machined well together, a little too well?, that's for you to decide. Each character has some trait that makes them interesting and seem to all have so much potential to entertain.Those characters who are highlighted have interesting stories such as Aihara Enju, whose growth and journey throughout the anime was so diverse and compelling that she felt like my own little sister, the only issue I had was that the time frame given to explore them is very limited and leaves one thirsting for more, and that is a good thing at least in as much as one wants more of something they  like, though it is frustrating for obvious reasons. Hopefully there is a second season coming.Overall, Black Bullet gave me many moments that left me amazed and left the impression of a solid entertaining anime, though looking at the bigger picture it may seem lacking. The good thing is that it is so strong in those small moments (which are numerous) that the bigger picture does not seem all that bad. It made me feel like it was making a promise or like it was a very beautiful dew drop about to fall of a very beautiful tree without actually seeing the fall. I can't see the whole tree or the other drops and yet it was satisfying to see. they are skipping some potentially epic points, though I can forgive this as Black bullet proves that the journey truly is better than the destination at times.In terms of Art and sound I would say they did not bore me because i know nothing about appreciating such, i usually just watch for story and characters.In terms of the characters I found that they were all well written and they machined well together, a little too well?, that's for you to decide.

If you really think it that way you have a problem with the analysis function of your brain.I will keep it short. Plot in this show is not unique. However it is OK to use it. Story in this anime is terrible. There is no real storyline so this ends up with confusing characters and actions. With a really good storyline that lasts 13 or even maybe 25 eps this could've been really really good.The strongest point of this show is the awesome moments you get to see a lot....With the help of the beautiful OSTs those moments capture viewers heart. There were moments which made me cry in tears as well as scenes with badass action. Those moments alone are enough to make this show enjoyable which in my opinion is the most important thing for a work of fiction. Also in a few occasion it made me think deeply.Overall a well wasted plot with a lot of great moments and ridicuolous stroyline.

I've read reviews which describe how mediocre the characters are and how cliche the plot and set-up is. True enough, you have the overpowered MC that every main girl has a crush on and he is thrown into situations wherein he's forced into being a hero (Kirito anyone?). However I'll argue that despite all this, the show is still pretty entertaining and delivers interesting content from time to time that...can keep you curious about what will happen next. I admit that the first few episodes could have been done better and the fight scenes as well, but the latter parts were good (in my opinion at least). The problem is that the show was trying to be everything at once (cute, serious, funny, gory, etc.) so I couldn't figure out where they were going with it at first. Still, as I've said the show delivered some interesting content towards the end (no particulars to avoid spoilers). There are the usual questions like who to fight for?, what does it take to destroy the monsters? (do you become a monster yourself in the process) and who the real enemy is? (not quite as good as Shingeki, but it's still there). I also liked how the fear and despair of the people and the characters are depicted and how it twists their perceptions on what is right.Overall, I can say that the show is still enjoyable despite its faults. I'm looking forward to season 2 and I hope the show improves on its current faults and weaknesses. can keep you curious about what will happen next.

A very intriguing one at that, but still a mess.Story: 3/10For humanity to best an enemy that threatens its very existence, they must first find unity. The gastrea virus, turning humans themselves to monsters that are at best difficult to beat, at worst practically immortal, is definitely such an enemy. As such, the main character who tries to defeat the gastrea finds himself first struggling to defeat the discrimination of the general public and the plain self interest of those in high places, before he even has a chance to fight the real enemy.This idea has been tackled by quite...a number of series to different amounts of success. It is an intriguing premise that offers many possibilties, yet requires one to be very careful to not to let the different threads of the story get tangled. Sadly, in this case they did get tangled, terribly so. While the story really does quite a decent job of justifying the main character's struggle, it only seems to manage to do so through making the antagonists of the story vary from the plain stupid to those that are actually just batshit insane. While there is no disputing that that message isn't entirely unjustified either, it fails to utterly to deal with the roots of these problems as the justification for the atrocities that are committed never go beyond plain revenge. While making the viewer question humanity's right to existence was not in itself bad, the original intention behind it all remains painfully unclear. The actual explanation as to where the hate and discrimination originates was never expressed in a clear way - if the intention was to say that it was completely unjustified, it still fails to have compelling rationale for happening.One of the more successful aspects of the story is the portrayal of the real(?) enemy, the gastrea. Despite remaining more of a backdrop for a good part of the series, as is often the case in this kind of plot, the threat is felt in a very real way on multiple occasions.

The main character seems to possess an uncanny resistance to character growth, ignoring every single chance he ever has to reform his ideas into something more consistent. The lolis, despite being potentially very good portrayals of children, end up being mainly utilized for the annoying fanservice bullshit. The few characters that experience any development do so with overnight 180s on their personalities.One of the most jarring things about the entire series is its utterly abysmal pacing. The important story developments are very rushed, while the downtime between the big stuff takes up a huge amount of the show. While I'm not one to dismiss the importance of exposition under any circumstance, it's even more baffling that the series fails to deliver an even nearly acceptable amount in those large segments that seem should be dedicated to it. At a closer look, these bits are actually all about developing the character relationships. Which seems to be something that the show does well, all up until you realize there has been zero actual progress, aside a couple of abrupt jumps, on this too. All in all, these huge amount of time spent trying to immerse the viewer in the characters left me to be completely unaffected when these characters were brutally murdered.Character: 6/10Through all the other inconsistencies, one thing that the series manages to achieve is a consistent style. However, judging from the fact that I can't think of a single good thing to say about that, I have to conclude that this was achieved through simply sticking to mediocrity.Art: 7/10I have no complaints, aside that I will never learn to understand Japanese ideas behind designing alien looking monsters. I have a hard time taking the gastrea seriously based on what is probably supposed to be a very intimidating appearance. Aside that, the art is good. Not outstanding in any manner, but really pleasing enough to the eye.Sound: 9/10Clearly the best part of the anime. I believe the only reason the anime managed to invoke any sort of feelings in me was because of the excellent voice acting reinforcing the personalities of the character to a huge degree. The music also was spot on most of the time, bringing the tension that was otherwise lacking in the rushed fight scenes. Also, the opening song was really the highlight of each episode of this anime, to be completely honest.Enjoyment: 7/10It manages to retain the resemblance of a quality anime for much of it, just barely, despite the constant inconsistencies (I actually think that's the right choice of words, dreadful as it is) and the terrible pacing with zero exposition. It's actually quite good fun whenever the nonsense isn't too jarring.Overall: 6/10It's not a terrible anime, and I dare say it had huge potential to be absolutely great. In general it keeps good production quality and doesn't go completely of the rails in any aspect. However, for someone who puts as much weight on story as I do, it's a painfully mediocre anime. It feels like the team really has what it takes to make a great anime, but perhaps the director was simply unqualified for the task. a number of series to different amounts of success. It is an intriguing premise that offers many possibilties, yet requires one to be very careful to not to let the different threads of the story get tangled. Sadly, in this case they did get tangled, terribly so. While the story really does quite a decent job of justifying the main character's struggle, it only seems to manage to do so through making the antagonists of the story vary from the plain stupid to those that are actually just batshit insane.

Humanity is driven to the brink of destruction by a species of powerful monsters named 'Gastrea'. You'd be forgiven for initially comparing this show to Attack on Titan, as many viewers did upon starting the series. Though the similarities end there.The story follows Rentaro Satomi and his partner, Enju, who is one of the many cursed children living in Tokyo. With the appearance of the Gastrea, a certain population were infected by a virus, and gave birth to children with superhuman abilities. One of the more interesting aspects of Black Bullet was the injustice and...prejudiced these children are forced to face. While the plot is overall quite weak, the social commentary was quite effective. In terms of the plot, that's really the only positive thing I have to say about this anime.The pacing is astronomically terrible. The first four episodes went by so quickly that the audience is barely given a chance to try and grasp what's going on. They could have honestly written an entire series based on the events of those episodes. Half-way through the anime I felt as though it should have already ended. In episode 4 there were literally about 5-6 climaxes happening all at the same time.  Absurd doesn't begin to describe the pacing of the show. Even for a 13 episode anime, they could have given us a chance to rest. Constant action and drama doesn't make a good anime, there needs to be a cool down in between.  The only time when there isn't any action or drama is when they throw in pointless fanservice or cliche jokes that we've heard a thousand times. There's very little room for actual character development.Another problem I had with this anime is that there are so many plot points which were completely forgotten and thrown aside. It's simply bad writing when you introduce all these separate plots, then drop them as if they hadn't even happened to begin with. The tricycle at the end of episode 4 was completely pointless and was never mentioned again. It gives me the impression that the writer started to introduce all these different scenarios then realised he had no idea where he was going to take any of them.Characters- 5/10For the most part the characters are bland and uninteresting. Our main protagonist is a rather brave and determined character, which is always nice to see given the amount of useless protagonists that are out there. However, he lacks any defining qualities. It's difficult to even work out what his motivation for fighting is. And while Rentaro may come across as a strong character, there are plenty of times when he is utterly powerless. There are plenty of times when Rentaro witnesses the mistreatment and abuse of the cursed children, yet never appears to step up or punish those responsible, despite the fact that he is more than capable of doing so. It gives us the impression that he is either apathetic or so significant that he has almost no impact on the world around him.There isn't really anything notable about Enju besides from her obsession with Rentaro. Her past is mentioned briefly but never explored. She has no unique traits whatsoever and I get the impression that the author just wanted to throw an energetic loli in there for good measure. There's only a small handful of characters that we remotely care about. Among those would be Kisara, Rentaro's childhood friend, and Tina, another loli that Rentaro picks up along his journey.For the most part Kisara lacks any kind of depth whatsoever and there's really nothing to set her apart from everyone else. She barely has an active role in the anime up until the end, when her character takes a rather sudden twist. There's nothing wrong with surprising the audience, but when you have absolutely no character development at all, then suddenly decide to pull a massive twist, it appears disjointed and jarring.There were a handful of other characters that had quite a bit of potential. Kagetane, the initial villain of the series, was rather an interesting and smooth character. Yet he only appears a couple of times despite being such a popular character. The rest of the characters that accompany Rentaro are given almost no screentime at all, to the point where we barely even care. Several characters important to the main character end up dying throughout the series, but their deaths are handled so nonchalantly that there's no emotional impact whatsoever. There were about two emotional scenes that the anime did pretty well, but for the most part I had no reason to care about any of the characters deaths.Art - 7/10The art was ok for the most part. Nothing remarkble however. The CGI for the Gastrea was pretty painful to look at, and the animation itself wasn't as fluid as it could have been. There were some scenes that were animated quite well but the series was occasionally prone to sudden drops in qualitySound - 6/10The soundtrack was extremely generic and forgettable. There isn't a single BGM track that I can recall. The opening theme was pretty well done, but it's not something I'll remember in a couple of months time.The ED theme, Tokohana, was pretty good however. I didn't skip the ED once throughout the series and I enjoyed listening to it. In all honesty the ED theme was one of my favourite things about the entire show.Overall - 6/10ConclusionAll in all, Black Bullet was a weak show with a pretty forgettable plot.There were one or two scenes which were handled well, but I find it difficult to relate to any of the characters. The pacing was a major flaw, and it was just bizarre how quickly the first four episodes flew past. Maybe it's just a poor adaption and there was nothing wrong with the light novel, but this anime his succeeded in putting me off the entire series forever. prejudiced these children are forced to face.

So when watching any show, I try my best to remove any expectations I have to spare myself the disappointment while being open-minded to enjoy the good points any show has.Unfortunately, I didn\'t do that with Black Bullet.It has nothing to do with external hype. It\'s just with the way Black Bullet is structured. I enjoyed it nonetheless but... it could have been so much more. It had so much potential and promise too. Oh well... on with the criteria:STORY -...6My rating for story is a combination of both premise and pacing.The premise was actually really good. Take the crisis of Attack on Titan, the epidemic likeness of Guilty Crown, the monsters of Alienators (if you\'ve heard of it), and the partnering system and expertise of Léon: The Professional (for the ""every badass needs a loli"" reference) just to give you an idea. The main threat to humanity has a weakness that\'s coincidentally abundant in Tokyo (Varanium) and the global organization set up to defeat said threat has a ranking system for the combatants.After that, everything just falls apart when it comes to pacing.There are two issues I have with Black Bullet\'s pacing: length and presentation.With such an ambitious and monumental premise, 13 episodes IS NOT ENOUGH. Character development, world development, important plot points, and buildup impact are all sacrificed just to get the show over with. With very little time to get plot points across, not only did events seem too contrived and convenient but it also leaves the viewer in the dark with what\'s going on. What\'s worse is that the show sometimes assumes the audience knows what\'s happening and continues tossing vital plot points which aid in confusion rather than understanding. I did manage to connect the dots eventually. But with a premise this huge, I\'d want sufficient details presented in an organized manner for me to soak up everything else the show offers me.Next, is presentation, which made the big mistake of making me expect something more out of this show. Black Bullet has three arcs. The first episode showed the titan of a premise this show had. And by the end of it, we get a villain I don\'t care about and a crisis that doesn\'t seem urgent enough to be called pre-apocalyptic. Skip to the second, we already have a problem and a rising action. And by the third and fourth, the show already reaches a climax and everything seems to reset after each arc. Balance is restored for another problem to screw everyone up and the hero to save the day (with a lot of casualties). Rinse and repeat. Black Bullet keeps showing glimpses of the plot potential it had and reminds you every time that there are 13 episodes. It presented the power-play of politics, the paranoia and oppression of the feared and misunderstood, the economic relations between nations during global crises, the inhumanity of mechanized warfare, and the struggle between vengeance and justice. It could\'ve expounded more on these issues. It\'s like window-shopping. You see all of these things you want to buy but you never get to enjoy them. What I got was a half-baked mess with action and tragedy to fill in the gaps.There\'s also the show\'s bipolar nature from the get-go. As much as I enjoyed happy-fun-times between the characters, it felt unnatural with the show\'s premise. On one hand, it amplifies the shows darkest moments like Higurashi or Madoka Magica. On the other, it interrupts the show. Black Bullet shuttles back-and-forth between being dark and tragic, to being cute and unassuming. Who could resist with the amount of lolis in this show? Add that to the length and it dampens the urgency and pain the show could\'ve delivered. All that gore, dismemberment, and dead bodies lost its meaning. Also, didn\'t help that most deaths occurred off-screen. *Sighs*And no, adding an unexpected plot twist will not redeem the damage already done.ART - 8It\'s a shame too because the art is really fit for a dark action series. Though the Gastrea (the monsters in this series) were slightly skimped, the weapons, action sequences and explosions (happy now, Michael Bay?) were well animated, especially DAT RAILGUN. Generous amounts of gore and Gastrea innards are spilled for our viewing pleasure, but like I said earlier, I hate off-screen events. It\'s like a cop-out for both the animators and writers. The character designs are of standard fare, and pretty cute if I do say so myself. No pedo.SOUND - 7As long as the OP and ED match the show\'s spirit, I don\'t skip it. But if it\'s really good, I download it. And luckily Black Bullet passes the mark with its choir-infused catchy J-pop opening, and orchestrated rock ED, with the brunt of the relatively high score coming from its background music: from glitchy tactical tunes, to a quirky piano and flute duo for light scenes, to rolling melancholic piano pieces with minimal choir and woodwinds, to a combination of orchestra and choir against the action set pieces. It doesn\'t stand out as much as other shows, but it fits well enough to gain my attention.The seiyuus did their job with special mentions to those who brought out the softspoken nature of Tina, the eccentricity of Muroto, the twisted ways of Kagetane and his daughter, the naivety of Enju, the burden of Rentarou, and the fragility of Kisara.CHARACTER - 4With this length coupled with a slightly large cast, I\'m not surprised that I didn\'t feel attached to any of them. Though I felt their situational agony largely contributed by the seiyuus and music, their development felt empty, neglected, and sometimes forced. Though the Gastrea are the main baddies, the human villains felt like they weren\'t even there; with one of them never participating again after one arc and another being so lame and awkward, I was surprised the entire cast let him live for 13 episodes.ENJOYMENT - 6I still enjoyed it. It just means adjusting the way I view the show. My insightful mindset devolved into being a sponge for moe, action, and drama. Goes to show how important execution is over substance. Instead of enjoying what I see on-screen, I was more entertained by the possibilities of what could make this show better. As good as it could be, nothing can change what\'s already there.Overall, Black Bullet receives a fair 6 for poor presentation of an otherwise colossal idea. In the end, it\'s just rushed. It\'s not the story\'s fault. The presentation, on the other hand, can go in a Heaven\'s Ladder Railgun Launcher and get blasted off to the next Stage 5 Gastrea along with an Ekpyrotic Bomb filled with my expectations. 6My rating for story is a combination of both premise and pacing.The premise was actually really good.

The anime bears several similarities to the well-received Attack on Titan series, but ultimately fails to deliver with its absurd and forced plot twists, its lack of supporting character development and its failure to offer proper resolution to the main conflict that it proposes.TL;DRStory: 2/10Art: 7/10Sound: 6/10Character: 5/10Enjoyment: 6/10Overall: 5/10 (rounded up from 4.875)...Good points:+ Exciting for some action scenes+ Great fast-paced action music+ Good art and animation+ Lots of moe characters+ Great OP themeBad points:- Poor and messy plot lines- Forced and unconvincing plot twists and lousy plot explanations- Underdeveloped cast of characters- Lack of proper pacing throughout anime, boring towards the middle- Lack of satisfactory resolution- Cliched and unoriginal main character- Lack of antagonist development- Insane amount of plot holes (17 in total)Story: 2/10Black Bullet is about humanity\'s defense against the Gastrea, an unknown alien lifeform that can infect humans and convert them into Gastrea, which threatens to destroy this particular Tokyo Area. Civil officers, also known as Promoters, are paired with Initiators, girls born with Gastrea Virus and have special powers, to fight against the Gastrea threat together. It is not known why Gastrea Virus only allows for the Cursed Children to be born only as females, but it sure helps the entire harem genre.The plot of Black Bullet is divided into 3 distinct plot arcs, namely the Hiruko Kagetane arc, the Tina Sprout arc and the final Aldebaran arc. I will go through the merits and flaws of each arc chronologically.In the first arc, our two inseparable protagonists, Satomi and Enju start off in the middle of a mission to locate and eliminate a Gastrea running rampant in the streets of Tokyo. The promoter-initiator team fail to catch it, but instead faces off with an infected human who turns into a Gastrea himself, and destroys him before he causes more havoc. Immediately we are given a grim reminder of how gory and bloody this anime can be, and of how much resemblance it bears to classic ""zombie""-type shows where humans are at risk of turning into monsters themselves. (+1 for excitement)Immediately afterward, the two are summoned by Seitenshi to a meeting of civil officers, where one of them, Hiruko Kagetane, starts killing off many of the civil officers there without proper reason and threatens to obtain a dangerous package, said to be able to summon a level 4 Gastrea, located within the Gastrea that was running rampant. At this point, explanation about the different classes and levels of Gastrea make them seem very similar to the Kaijus as depicted in Pacific Rim, where the higher level they are, the large and more powerful they become. As Satomi races to get the package ahead of Kagetane, he encounters them and gets defeated but somehow survives to have another go at them again. This time, he and Enju managed to beat them and retrieve the package that Seitenshi needed.The contents of the package, as it turns out, happens to be a little bicycle rather than something dangerous that Satomi thought it would be, but after confronting Seitenshi about this, he isn\'t given any answers and for the rest of this anime, nothing further is said about the first Kanto war, or about the origins of the Gastrea in the first place, so that\'s a real bummer. The anime completely avoids any explanation on the entire point of the first arc, so it really suffers from plot depth entirely.In the second arc, Seitenshi hires Satomi as a personal bodyguard, and in so doing introduces a very unnecessary, stupid and annoying ""rivalry"" between Satomi and Yasuwaki, who has a complex for Seitenshi-sama (though honestly, who wouldn\'t when she has that innocent kind of face?). This particular plot point sparks off an entire host of stupid ""revenge"" things that Yasuwaki does which end up as failed plot twists. We learn soon that Seitenshi is an assassination target by a girl called Tina Sprout, who so happens bumps into Satomi in the day, and has to face-off with him at night while he is guarding Seitenshi.When Ayn Rand, Tina\'s boss, finds out Satomi\'s identity, he orders Tina Sprout to kill Kisara, Satomi\'s boss. At this point Tina doesn\'t know that Satomi is the bodyguard and she conveniently drops her phone after someone bumps into her so that she never gets the information that Satomi was actually her target. Kisara nearly dies in Tina\'s hands, but it was honestly Tina\'s fault that she failed to kill Kisara faster. Anyway, Satomi is there to save her and finally faces off against Tina in a battle where Satomi triumphs.Yasuwaki then randomly appears and shoots Tina, and then immediately gets demoted by Seitenshi, who has somehow known that Tina was being controlled by Ayn Rand, and then promotes Satomi to be Yasuwaki\'s senior-in-rank. Again, at the end of the arc, we get no explanation about Ayn Rand and his connection to Sogen, the alleged perpetrator of the whole episode, and we also get no explanation as to why Tina wasn\'t charged with anything and how come she can suddenly join the Tendo Civil Security agency. This arc was honestly quite the mess.The last and final arc was basically a huge war between the Gastrea and the civil officers, sparked by the collapse of Monolith 32 due to a varanium-corrosive liquid that a level 4 Gastrea, Aldebaran was emitting. It starts off with Satomi looking around for people to join his team, and managed to get Katagiri Tamaki, his older brother and Shouma Nagisawa, and old friend, to do so.While preparations are being made to defend against the frontal Gastrea assault, there is a side-story arc about Satomi and Kisara teaching a group of Cursed Children kids and getting all familiar with them before they are brutally bombed by unknown people who are not mentioned in the anime, and increasing the drama and tension between normal people and cursed children, and advancing the plot in no particular way. This segment was completely useless because the children were only after they died, so the melodrama felt completely forced and lame.Anyway, back to the war, the civil officers are down to 50% of the strength after they unexpectedly encounter the Pleiades, known as the Spear of Light that killed many of their forces in the first battle. Satomi then, under orders, sets off the kill the Pleiades once and for all so that they would have an upper hand in the subsequent fight. Satomi ends up encountering Kagetane, whom he thought he killed off in the first arc, who saved his life from a bunch of Gastrea wolves. The two end up cooperating to kill of Pleiades and they rush back to the remaining civil officers to regroup for a final stand against the remaining Gastrea.After some absolutely mindless dictatorship act by Satomi, who claims that it\'s better for the civil officers to fear their leader than to fear the Gastrea, they come up with a plan, together with Miori, a weapons specialist, to insert an EP Bomb capable of destroying the supposedly-immortal Aldebaran from the inside. As the plan goes underway, Satomi managed to get the bomb in, but for reasons unknown and for plot convenience, the bomb\'s timer malfunctions and Shouma ends up having to use his shockwave punch to detonate it, killing both Aldebaran and Shouma in a massive giant explosion.In the end, they are announced as victors of the 3rd Gastrea War. Kisara ends up killing Kazumitsu, her brother, who endangered everyone\'s lives by making Monolith 32 out of cheaper material. However, nothing conclusive is said about the entire discrimination against Cursed Children conflict and the perpetrators who bombed innocent schoolchildren were never found. Also, Kisara ends up being engulfed by some inner evil and leaves Satomi, putting an end to a relationship that the audience honestly wanted to have succeeded.Most of the story was pretty much cliched and non-original. While there was some attempt at creating a deeper plot, by chunking elements of discrimination, revenge and corruption into it, none of these themes were thoroughly examined enough to give it credit. Also, none of the plot twists made any sense, as those that were surprising were incoherent and those that had potential were never explained. There was at least a main overarching conflict as in the war against Gastrea, but this conflict was never resolved (+1). As for coherence, I have a lot of plot holes to mention.In Episode 2, the old man in the business suit tells all the civil security officers intend to decline the job to leave, despite him not informing them anything about the details of the job. He then goes on to say that the moment they are informed, they cannot decline. So basically nobody is allowed to make informed decisions? In the end, the job of retrieving the package turned out to be ""first-come-first-serve"" so none of what that man said held any water.Also, in episode 2, when Hiruko Kagetane is officially introduced, he takes out a clean present that is later revealed to have contained a decapitated head. The anime then cuts into a horrifying ""reveal"" of a bloodied present to give the audience a scare. But this is all a farce because if there really was a bloody head inside, how the heck did Kagetane keep the present so clean all this while? Also, if Kagetane killed that man earlier, shouldn\'t all the blood in the head have dried up by now? None of this makes sense, the dramatic reveal was really forced.In episode 3, there is a lot of talk about the Initiators being discriminated against even though they protect humanity. But if the Cursed Children are the only way to defeat Gastrea, then why are so many of them still left to live alone in the outskirts? Is the majority of humanity ignorant of this fact? Because that\'s not possible with so many civil servants around.Also, why aren\'t these children being sent to government training facilities and made to hone their skills to fight against Gastrea? Why is it that so many of these children are left abandoned, left to die, and only a few are becoming Initiators? That\'s just a huge wastage of talent right there.Also, when Satomi is defeated by Kagetane, he gets shot in the chest, then stabbed and sawed repeatedly by two swords, then shot again in the chest and falls off a cliff into a river. It\'s hard to believe at this point, that he could still possibly survive. Even if the blood loss doesn\'t kill him, he would drown. Also, he manages to recover without any major organ damage within one day and three hours. I don\'t know about you, but this guy must be Wolverine or something.In Episode 6, highly skilled assassin Tina finds that the best way to identify her target is to simply ask the target herself and get vocal confirmation, instead of visual confirmation. This basically gives Kisara time to react and prevented Tina from succeeding her mission with one hit. Not very professional, if you ask me. If Tina\'s boss has given her all the required information to track down Kisara, there\'s no reason he wasn\'t able to give her an image to allow her to confirm her target.In Episode 7, Yasuwaki goes to ambush Satomi and shoots Tina, then says that he wanted to see Satomi\'s desperate reaction to it. But how would Yasuwaki know anything about Satomi\'s relationship with Tina? In fact, how would Yasuwaki even know that Tina was still alive when she was barely even moving in Satomi\'s arms? Also, how the heck were the two others guards able to pin down Satomi by just holding each of his arms? Satomi is way stronger than that and would have easily escaped their grapple and stopped Yasuwaki.At the end of the episode, Tina joins Kisara\'s agency but nothing is said of her interrogation or sentence. Does this mean Tina was acquitted? How and why? Perhaps because she was a minor?I guess that means it\'s perfectly fine to assassinate people as long as you\'re a minor then. Also, even though the anime does mention that Ayn Rand would come to target her soon, this is never followed-up on in the anime, so it fails right there.In Episode 10, the anime makes a futile attempt at introducing the names of the schoolchildren after they\'ve all died. Unfortunately, they should have done this earlier and since all of the children were pretty much the same, they could all have just been one entity and it wouldn\'t have mattered. The entire emotional scene is a complete farce that doesn\'t do anything for the plot anyway. Who bombed the place? How did this person know that place amidst all the rubble even exists? None of this was explained in the anime, just left hanging for audiences to get confused.In Episode 11, Tina says that her Shenfield scanners can only scan surroundings but cannot send images to her. This makes no sense because if she can control them remotely, and if Shenfield has a scanning ability, there\'s no reason why it can\'t send the wavelength information back to her. Also, how does she know that the mercury-shooting Gastrea was large if she didn\'t get any image from Shenfield? This is just a convenient way to introduce a new enemy while keeping it mysterious.Also, if Tina noticed this dangerous Gastrea during the battle, why only bring it up so long AFTER the first battle ended? Did she not think that such information would be incredibly useful in making tactical decisions during the battle?In Episode 12, we are so many years into the future but Miori is using stage lighting to locate the enemy? What ever happened to infrared radar, satellite tracking or even sonar? And if the Aldebaran is so huge anyway, isn\'t it pretty obvious where it\'s location is? It can be seen from like miles away, and that amount of destruction it leaves in it\'s wake is completely noticeable!Furthermore, at the end of the episode, Yasuwaki decides that throwing away the batteries and potentially letting the whole of Tokyo Area and himself get destroyed is okay as long as he gets his revenge on Rentaro. Do I look like I have the time to put up with any more of this annoying and stupid character\'s nonsense? Seriously?And finally, we have episode 13 which has like the most plot holes of the entire anime, attributing it to the incredibly horrible resolution.First, the Tokyo citizens light up flying lanterns to represent their wishes, which inadvertently helps Satomi and the others to identify the enemy\'s position. If they needed those huge spotlights to spot the Aldebaran in the first place, there\'s no way those lanterns flying so high up in the sky would give enough light to light up the place anyway. The hot air would carry them too high up in the sky for their light to reach the ground below, even if there were millions of those lanterns.Also, for the lanterns to give enough light throughout the entire battle, the citizens would have to be continually lighting up lanterns repeatedly throughout the battle, otherwise the lanterns would burn out within 15 minutes. But we clearly see the citizens doing nothing but watching after lighting up the first set of lanterns.Second, at the most critical point of the anime, they throw another expected senseless twist.The EP bomb has an ""error"" for no apparent reason other than plot convenience so that Satomi and Shouma can dramatically decide to sacrifice themselves in an attempt to destroy Aldabaran.Third, Satomi punches Enju in the stomach to knock her out so that he can sacrifice himself, but this is the first time I\'ve heard of the idea of someone getting knocked out by a blow to the stomach. In fact, Enju is more likely to have suffered severe organ damage before any loss of consciousness would have occured.Fourth, Kisara has always been saying that Gastrea killed her parents, how did she suddenly know that Kazumitsu was to blame for her parents\' death, just because of his involvement with Monolith 32? There seems to be a rather huge logic jump here. Even if her parents\' death was suspicious, there was no reason to suspect her brother immediately.Fifth, Kisara claims that the second strike of her secret sword style moves ""faster than sound"".Unfortunately, when Kisara did that move, no sound was heard from the shockwaves that should have been created by the blade moving so quickly through the air.Also, the sudden reveal that Kisara had already killed Kazumitsu made no sense whatsoever. Even if her slash was so quick that it was unnoticeable, it cannot explain why it took so long for Kazumitsu\'s head to split apart. Kazumitsu easily sat there talking with Kisara for 3 minutes before he ""exploded"" into blood and gore. This sudden twist was rather unnecessary and incredibly forced.Altogether that\'s a total of 17 plot holes (for a 13-episode anime, that\'s pretty high, more than 1 plot fail per episode), and because of the incredibly high number, I\'m afraid I have to go with zero points for coherence and logical sense of this plot, because there basically just isn\'t any. The plot does more to confuse us than to amaze us and spits at us when it wants to make twists. This is honestly the first time I\'ve given a score for the plot for any anime so low.Art: 7/10The general artistic theme of the anime is pretty good, I thoroughly enjoyed the drawing and aesthetic of all the characters. They were pretty varied and creatively drawn. Even Seitenshi-sama who had quite the mono-colour scheme fit well with her ""fixed"" mindset and personality. The fighting scenes were pretty well animated, and was exciting when it was done well. Unfortunately, there were many instances where this anime got lazy with those scenes and made them end in mere seconds.Opening sequence: 2/2Ending sequence: 0/2Animation: 2/3Aesthetics: 3/3Sound: 6/10OP Theme: 2/2 - Absolutely fantastic, I always kept this running through every episode because it was so upbeat and excitingED Theme: 1/2 - Quite an okay theme, but nothing too amazingBackground Music: 3/4 - Most of it was actually really good, like during the action and fast-paced scenes, the music really kept the suspense up. But for the emotional scenes, they kept repeating the same not-very-melancholic tune over and over again that it really detracted from those scenes.No additional themes: 0/2Character: 5/10The main character is Satomi Rentaro, a civil officer who is basically a fighter of justice (and oh I\'ve heard this title far too often already). He has exceptional Tendo skills and his martial art fighting style is simple, yet powerful and effective. (+1 for great fighting skills) Unfortunately nothing much else stands out for him. His character is rather cliched, just the same hero trying to protect the people around him and is willing to risk his life in doing so. At one point, his character seems to change and he becomes a ruthless dictator to rally the troops together, but this is completely reversed when we know he is just putting on an act. He\'s your stereotypical male lead with little more than face value.The other character that I was quite interested in at the beginning was Kisara. She clearly had a very dark past, even setting up her civil security agency out of ""revenge"" against the Gastrea. Although we don\'t see much character development apart from ""having feelings for Satomi"", she eventually goes crazy out of her desire for revenge that she murders her own brother and sells her soul to evil. This is pretty rare for animes out there, to have a main character becoming ""corrupt"" and never really resolving by the end of the anime, so I\'ll at least give a point for that. (+1 for unique growth). She also has pretty badass sword skills but they were so rarely shown in the anime, it\'s hard to love her for that. She is pretty moe though, and does get into a lot of awkward and funny interactions with Satomi, so I guess that\'s a plus (+1 for cuteness).Enju Aihara, Satomi\'s partner, first strikes as a very lovable, cute character. She\'s playful, has an obsession for Rentaro, and is probably the most developed and grown character out of all the initiators out there. She starts off naive, ignorant of the real world, but once she is exposed to seeing the discrimination against Cursed Children, leading to death and destruction, we start to see a slight improvement in maturity, where she learns, through talks with Satomi, to decide for herself what she is fighting for (+1 for growth). Unfortunately, she doesn\'t get much action time and ultimately just sits back and does nothing for the plot while Satomi does all the plot-driving work.Then we have the antagonist, or former antagonsit, Hiruko Kagetane, who starts off being portrayed as a bloodthirsty crazy killer who kills without reason, into having some actual reasons for him doing so (aka ""ushering a new age""). But he has this weird interest in Satomi that convinces him not to kill Satomi off immediately, and even ends up teaming up with him and protecting him from bullets toward the end of the anime. We don\'t know much else about him, except that he\'s a rather complex and interesting character. (+1 for interest)The last character that is worth mentioning is Tina Sprout, who converted from being an assassin who targets Seitenshi, to a fellow Initiator, and Kisara\'s partner. She starts off completely brainwashed, feeling purposeless if she doesn\'t listen to orders and kill people, and eventually managed to find hope in Satomi, whom she also falls for. Unfortunately, after that point she also lost all sense of being a character whatsoever. In fact, it\'s not just Tina, but all the other Cursed Children as well who all suddenly begin to converge into a single entity - this collective archetype of people who ""fall in love with Satomi"" and think of nothing but marrying him. All of a sudden, the character development falls off when it could have taken flight, so this was honestly very unfortunate.The rest of the supporting cast does have a host of interesting characters. People like Sumire, Shouma and Kayou Senji, all look like they have been through a lot, and I would really have loved to hear their backstories, but we know basically none of it. We know a bit of their background, but nothing substantial enough to have a say on their character. Every other character is a complete waste of time and even less is known about them.Enjoyment: 6/10Altogether, this anime was quite the disappointment for me, but I wasn\'t expecting much from it either. There were some parts that I got really bored, and there were also some parts where I was quite interested to watch on.On the humour side, the anime has performed okay. There were many funny parts between Satomi and Kisara and their supposed love line, and this happens throughout the anime. Enju\'s and Tina\'s reactions to Satomi are also funny at first, until it becomes a bit too repetitive until they weren\'t funny anymore. But there were also funny parts involving Sumire who constantly teased Satomi about his crush for Kisara. (+1)In terms of excitement, I would say that the anime has done rather well. From the beginning it kicked off with great action that got more and more interesting as the story progressed from just fighting Gastrea to dealing with an assassination threat and finally to an all out war. I can\'t give full points for it though because the action and excitement during the final arc was very underwhelming, and I honestly expected to see much more ""war"" scenes than just the few that occurred. (+2)In terms of emotion, the anime really and completely failed there. There are some valid attempts during the parts where Satomi and Enju are emotionally torn about what they are fighting for. But in especially the part where Satomi mourns for the dead schoolchildren, the emotion really felt so forced because we didn\'t even know their names before they died, and while the voice acting was realistic, the character development was not. (+1)Pacing-wise, the anime definitely managed to grip the audience from the beginning, but it kind of faltered towards the middle and failed to sustain this interest throughout. There were many slow-paced scenes where I honestly felt bored with all the talking and there were scenes which I felt I could simply totally skip because they bore no significance to the plot or characters. Also, the resolution wasn\'t very satisfactory because the threat of Gastrea was still out there and there were many loose ends about the truth of Gastrea, the future of Kagetane, Kisara, and many things unexplained. (+1)This anime receives 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes. (+1)Overall: 4.875/10Black Bullet is probably an anime you want to watch only if you have some time to kill and really no other shows to watch, or you just want to watch something without becoming too overly attached to it. It suffers from a great many plot holes and lousy plot developments, coupled with poor resolution and plot explanations. It also basically suffers from sub-par characters with little backstory and development to work with. The best part of this anime was the action music, no doubt about it. Good points:+ Exciting for some action scenes+ Great fast-paced action music+ Good art and animation+ Lots of moe characters+ Great OP themeBad points:- Poor and messy plot lines- Forced and unconvincing plot twists and lousy plot explanations- Underdeveloped cast of characters- Lack of proper pacing throughout anime, boring towards the middle- Lack of satisfactory resolution- Cliched and unoriginal main character- Lack of antagonist development- Insane amount of plot holes (17 in total)Story: 2/10Black Bullet is about humanity\'s defense against the Gastrea, an unknown alien lifeform that can infect humans and convert them into Gastrea, which threatens to destroy this particular Tokyo Area. Civil officers, also known as Promoters, are paired with Initiators, girls born with Gastrea Virus and have special powers, to fight against the Gastrea threat together. It is not known why Gastrea Virus only allows for the Cursed Children to be born only as females, but it sure helps the entire harem genre.The plot of Black Bullet is divided into 3 distinct plot arcs, namely the Hiruko Kagetane arc, the Tina Sprout arc and the final Aldebaran arc. I will go through the merits and flaws of each arc chronologically.In the first arc, our two inseparable protagonists, Satomi and Enju start off in the middle of a mission to locate and eliminate a Gastrea running rampant in the streets of Tokyo. The promoter-initiator team fail to catch it, but instead faces off with an infected human who turns into a Gastrea himself, and destroys him before he causes more havoc. Immediately we are given a grim reminder of how gory and bloody this anime can be, and of how much resemblance it bears to classic ""zombie""-type shows where humans are at risk of turning into monsters themselves. (+1 for excitement)Immediately afterward, the two are summoned by Seitenshi to a meeting of civil officers, where one of them, Hiruko Kagetane, starts killing off many of the civil officers there without proper reason and threatens to obtain a dangerous package, said to be able to summon a level 4 Gastrea, located within the Gastrea that was running rampant. At this point, explanation about the different classes and levels of Gastrea make them seem very similar to the Kaijus as depicted in Pacific Rim, where the higher level they are, the large and more powerful they become. As Satomi races to get the package ahead of Kagetane, he encounters them and gets defeated but somehow survives to have another go at them again. This time, he and Enju managed to beat them and retrieve the package that Seitenshi needed.The contents of the package, as it turns out, happens to be a little bicycle rather than something dangerous that Satomi thought it would be, but after confronting Seitenshi about this, he isn\'t given any answers and for the rest of this anime, nothing further is said about the first Kanto war, or about the origins of the Gastrea in the first place, so that\'s a real bummer. The anime completely avoids any explanation on the entire point of the first arc, so it really suffers from plot depth entirely.In the second arc, Seitenshi hires Satomi as a personal bodyguard, and in so doing introduces a very unnecessary, stupid and annoying ""rivalry"" between Satomi and Yasuwaki, who has a complex for Seitenshi-sama (though honestly, who wouldn\'t when she has that innocent kind of face?). This particular plot point sparks off an entire host of stupid ""revenge"" things that Yasuwaki does which end up as failed plot twists. We learn soon that Seitenshi is an assassination target by a girl called Tina Sprout, who so happens bumps into Satomi in the day, and has to face-off with him at night while he is guarding Seitenshi.When Ayn Rand, Tina\'s boss, finds out Satomi\'s identity, he orders Tina Sprout to kill Kisara, Satomi\'s boss. At this point Tina doesn\'t know that Satomi is the bodyguard and she conveniently drops her phone after someone bumps into her so that she never gets the information that Satomi was actually her target. Kisara nearly dies in Tina\'s hands, but it was honestly Tina\'s fault that she failed to kill Kisara faster. Anyway, Satomi is there to save her and finally faces off against Tina in a battle where Satomi triumphs.Yasuwaki then randomly appears and shoots Tina, and then immediately gets demoted by Seitenshi, who has somehow known that Tina was being controlled by Ayn Rand, and then promotes Satomi to be Yasuwaki\'s senior-in-rank. Again, at the end of the arc, we get no explanation about Ayn Rand and his connection to Sogen, the alleged perpetrator of the whole episode, and we also get no explanation as to why Tina wasn\'t charged with anything and how come she can suddenly join the Tendo Civil Security agency.

As the plan goes underway, Satomi managed to get the bomb in, but for reasons unknown and for plot convenience, the bomb\'s timer malfunctions and Shouma ends up having to use his shockwave punch to detonate it, killing both Aldebaran and Shouma in a massive giant explosion.In the end, they are announced as victors of the 3rd Gastrea War. Kisara ends up killing Kazumitsu, her brother, who endangered everyone\'s lives by making Monolith 32 out of cheaper material. However, nothing conclusive is said about the entire discrimination against Cursed Children conflict and the perpetrators who bombed innocent schoolchildren were never found. Also, Kisara ends up being engulfed by some inner evil and leaves Satomi, putting an end to a relationship that the audience honestly wanted to have succeeded.Most of the story was pretty much cliched and non-original.

It can be seen from like miles away, and that amount of destruction it leaves in it\'s wake is completely noticeable!Furthermore, at the end of the episode, Yasuwaki decides that throwing away the batteries and potentially letting the whole of Tokyo Area and himself get destroyed is okay as long as he gets his revenge on Rentaro. Do I look like I have the time to put up with any more of this annoying and stupid character\'s nonsense? Seriously?And finally, we have episode 13 which has like the most plot holes of the entire anime, attributing it to the incredibly horrible resolution.First, the Tokyo citizens light up flying lanterns to represent their wishes, which inadvertently helps Satomi and the others to identify the enemy\'s position. If they needed those huge spotlights to spot the Aldebaran in the first place, there\'s no way those lanterns flying so high up in the sky would give enough light to light up the place anyway. The hot air would carry them too high up in the sky for their light to reach the ground below, even if there were millions of those lanterns.Also, for the lanterns to give enough light throughout the entire battle, the citizens would have to be continually lighting up lanterns repeatedly throughout the battle, otherwise the lanterns would burn out within 15 minutes. But we clearly see the citizens doing nothing but watching after lighting up the first set of lanterns.Second, at the most critical point of the anime, they throw another expected senseless twist.The EP bomb has an ""error"" for no apparent reason other than plot convenience so that Satomi and Shouma can dramatically decide to sacrifice themselves in an attempt to destroy Aldabaran.Third, Satomi punches Enju in the stomach to knock her out so that he can sacrifice himself, but this is the first time I\'ve heard of the idea of someone getting knocked out by a blow to the stomach. In fact, Enju is more likely to have suffered severe organ damage before any loss of consciousness would have occured.Fourth, Kisara has always been saying that Gastrea killed her parents, how did she suddenly know that Kazumitsu was to blame for her parents\' death, just because of his involvement with Monolith 32? There seems to be a rather huge logic jump here. Even if her parents\' death was suspicious, there was no reason to suspect her brother immediately.Fifth, Kisara claims that the second strike of her secret sword style moves ""faster than sound"".Unfortunately, when Kisara did that move, no sound was heard from the shockwaves that should have been created by the blade moving so quickly through the air.Also, the sudden reveal that Kisara had already killed Kazumitsu made no sense whatsoever. Even if her slash was so quick that it was unnoticeable, it cannot explain why it took so long for Kazumitsu\'s head to split apart. Kazumitsu easily sat there talking with Kisara for 3 minutes before he ""exploded"" into blood and gore. This sudden twist was rather unnecessary and incredibly forced.Altogether that\'s a total of 17 plot holes (for a 13-episode anime, that\'s pretty high, more than 1 plot fail per episode), and because of the incredibly high number, I\'m afraid I have to go with zero points for coherence and logical sense of this plot, because there basically just isn\'t any. The plot does more to confuse us than to amaze us and spits at us when it wants to make twists. This is honestly the first time I\'ve given a score for the plot for any anime so low.Art: 7/10The general artistic theme of the anime is pretty good, I thoroughly enjoyed the drawing and aesthetic of all the characters. They were pretty varied and creatively drawn. Even Seitenshi-sama who had quite the mono-colour scheme fit well with her ""fixed"" mindset and personality. The fighting scenes were pretty well animated, and was exciting when it was done well. Unfortunately, there were many instances where this anime got lazy with those scenes and made them end in mere seconds.Opening sequence: 2/2Ending sequence: 0/2Animation: 2/3Aesthetics: 3/3Sound: 6/10OP Theme: 2/2 - Absolutely fantastic, I always kept this running through every episode because it was so upbeat and excitingED Theme: 1/2 - Quite an okay theme, but nothing too amazingBackground Music: 3/4 - Most of it was actually really good, like during the action and fast-paced scenes, the music really kept the suspense up. But for the emotional scenes, they kept repeating the same not-very-melancholic tune over and over again that it really detracted from those scenes.No additional themes: 0/2Character: 5/10The main character is Satomi Rentaro, a civil officer who is basically a fighter of justice (and oh I\'ve heard this title far too often already). He has exceptional Tendo skills and his martial art fighting style is simple, yet powerful and effective. (+1 for great fighting skills) Unfortunately nothing much else stands out for him. His character is rather cliched, just the same hero trying to protect the people around him and is willing to risk his life in doing so. At one point, his character seems to change and he becomes a ruthless dictator to rally the troops together, but this is completely reversed when we know he is just putting on an act. He\'s your stereotypical male lead with little more than face value.The other character that I was quite interested in at the beginning was Kisara. She clearly had a very dark past, even setting up her civil security agency out of ""revenge"" against the Gastrea. Although we don\'t see much character development apart from ""having feelings for Satomi"", she eventually goes crazy out of her desire for revenge that she murders her own brother and sells her soul to evil. This is pretty rare for animes out there, to have a main character becoming ""corrupt"" and never really resolving by the end of the anime, so I\'ll at least give a point for that. (+1 for unique growth). She also has pretty badass sword skills but they were so rarely shown in the anime, it\'s hard to love her for that. She is pretty moe though, and does get into a lot of awkward and funny interactions with Satomi, so I guess that\'s a plus (+1 for cuteness).Enju Aihara, Satomi\'s partner, first strikes as a very lovable, cute character. She\'s playful, has an obsession for Rentaro, and is probably the most developed and grown character out of all the initiators out there. She starts off naive, ignorant of the real world, but once she is exposed to seeing the discrimination against Cursed Children, leading to death and destruction, we start to see a slight improvement in maturity, where she learns, through talks with Satomi, to decide for herself what she is fighting for (+1 for growth). Unfortunately, she doesn\'t get much action time and ultimately just sits back and does nothing for the plot while Satomi does all the plot-driving work.Then we have the antagonist, or former antagonsit, Hiruko Kagetane, who starts off being portrayed as a bloodthirsty crazy killer who kills without reason, into having some actual reasons for him doing so (aka ""ushering a new age""). But he has this weird interest in Satomi that convinces him not to kill Satomi off immediately, and even ends up teaming up with him and protecting him from bullets toward the end of the anime. We don\'t know much else about him, except that he\'s a rather complex and interesting character. (+1 for interest)The last character that is worth mentioning is Tina Sprout, who converted from being an assassin who targets Seitenshi, to a fellow Initiator, and Kisara\'s partner. She starts off completely brainwashed, feeling purposeless if she doesn\'t listen to orders and kill people, and eventually managed to find hope in Satomi, whom she also falls for. Unfortunately, after that point she also lost all sense of being a character whatsoever. In fact, it\'s not just Tina, but all the other Cursed Children as well who all suddenly begin to converge into a single entity - this collective archetype of people who ""fall in love with Satomi"" and think of nothing but marrying him. All of a sudden, the character development falls off when it could have taken flight, so this was honestly very unfortunate.The rest of the supporting cast does have a host of interesting characters. People like Sumire, Shouma and Kayou Senji, all look like they have been through a lot, and I would really have loved to hear their backstories, but we know basically none of it. We know a bit of their background, but nothing substantial enough to have a say on their character. Every other character is a complete waste of time and even less is known about them.Enjoyment: 6/10Altogether, this anime was quite the disappointment for me, but I wasn\'t expecting much from it either. There were some parts that I got really bored, and there were also some parts where I was quite interested to watch on.On the humour side, the anime has performed okay. There were many funny parts between Satomi and Kisara and their supposed love line, and this happens throughout the anime. Enju\'s and Tina\'s reactions to Satomi are also funny at first, until it becomes a bit too repetitive until they weren\'t funny anymore. But there were also funny parts involving Sumire who constantly teased Satomi about his crush for Kisara. (+1)In terms of excitement, I would say that the anime has done rather well. From the beginning it kicked off with great action that got more and more interesting as the story progressed from just fighting Gastrea to dealing with an assassination threat and finally to an all out war. I can\'t give full points for it though because the action and excitement during the final arc was very underwhelming, and I honestly expected to see much more ""war"" scenes than just the few that occurred. (+2)In terms of emotion, the anime really and completely failed there. There are some valid attempts during the parts where Satomi and Enju are emotionally torn about what they are fighting for. But in especially the part where Satomi mourns for the dead schoolchildren, the emotion really felt so forced because we didn\'t even know their names before they died, and while the voice acting was realistic, the character development was not. (+1)Pacing-wise, the anime definitely managed to grip the audience from the beginning, but it kind of faltered towards the middle and failed to sustain this interest throughout. There were many slow-paced scenes where I honestly felt bored with all the talking and there were scenes which I felt I could simply totally skip because they bore no significance to the plot or characters. Also, the resolution wasn\'t very satisfactory because the threat of Gastrea was still out there and there were many loose ends about the truth of Gastrea, the future of Kagetane, Kisara, and many things unexplained. (+1)This anime receives 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes. (+1)Overall: 4.875/10Black Bullet is probably an anime you want to watch only if you have some time to kill and really no other shows to watch, or you just want to watch something without becoming too overly attached to it. It suffers from a great many plot holes and lousy plot developments, coupled with poor resolution and plot explanations. It also basically suffers from sub-par characters with little backstory and development to work with. The best part of this anime was the action music, no doubt about it.', 'black bullet also known as little girl murder the show is good now the story itself is stupid and so rushed it looks like a Moe girl sprinting to school with toast in her mouth only to bump into Mr spiky hair main character number 117 how ever i found the general setting to be a refreshing take on the caged humanity setting the art it self is good and refreshing although not revolutionary now i am going to sound absolutely crazy but i found characters both the best and worst part of the show  the main character the two  little ten year...old lolis and the local tundere and the awesome crazy farther and daughter are the only well written characters everyone else was poorly written and hard to rember and to the shows credit they gave the mc ptsd and had him breakdown crying over the fact that they were not so memorable like that is how it was meant to be now for me the main character breaking down like a little tiny bitch basically saved it and the sound the sound was the best part haveing a gun sound different be cause of the BLACK BULLETS was a nice little thing they ended as well as a great sound track made by shiro sagisu who has worked on stuff like bezerk and neon genesis but hey who cares about all that stupid crap the real question is was it enjoyable should i watch it the answer is yes give it a shot old lolis and the local tundere and the awesome crazy farther and daughter are the only well written characters everyone else was poorly written and hard to rember and to the shows credit they gave the mc ptsd and had him breakdown crying over the fact that they were not so memorable like that is how it was meant to be now for me the main character breaking down like a little tiny bitch basically saved it and the sound the sound was the best part haveing a gun sound different be cause of the BLACK BULLETS was a nice little thing they ended as well as a great sound track made by shiro sagisu who has worked on stuff like bezerk and neon genesis but hey who cares about all that stupid crap the real question is was it enjoyable should i watch it the answer is yes give it a shot', 'I hate bugs. And I think a lot of you share my hatred. Now imagine a world where you have bugs that are three, four or even five times bigger than you. Would you dare to fight them? Well in the world of this anime, you have no choice but to fight. Today\'s anime review a on MAL 7,51 rated show called BLACK BULLET.Plot and StorylineI would probably freak out in a world like this. In the near future a viral parasites named Gastrea broke out and defeated the mankind. Gatreas are basically bug-like monsters that kill people. But the biggest problem about them is...that they can turn people into monsters when they infect them with the virus. Still, the virus can effect the people in another way. Imagine what happens when a pregnant woman is infected. Well, her child, and always a girl, turns into a ""cursed child"", being just a human but with special powers. The government uses those children to fight Gastrea together with Civil officers and always in pairs. One of the pairs are also the protagonist of our story. Enju and Rentarou became partners a year ago and have been close to each other since that day. Their strength was about to be proven after they were assigned to their   most important and dangerous mission. The prevention of destruction of their hometown, Tokyo.The, let\'s say, main story was nicely done. A smooth development, no stupid adds and no plot holes. It was very interesting to watch and it definitely made me more and more curious with each episode. Still, I have one reproach. There is a side story in this anime which appeared somewhere in the middle and in the end. That ""side story"" was actually just an enormous plot hole. To be honest I didn\'t even understand what it was all about. It seemed so important but was bumped into half of an episode. The story could have lived even without it and I found it more confusing rather than interesting.I felt like the story kinda carried a transparent layer of something we face everyday. It shows how society usually deals with the part of population that sticks out for a certain reason. Even though they might help and contribute to the society, people often abandon them because they are scared of changes. Even though the Gastrea-girls can help and even save society, there are still persons who hate and discriminate them.An interesting and catchy story that can help you to overcome boredom anytime a day.CharactersThe characters in this anime are not that special, or rather not special at all. I mean it is a 13 episoded anime, and as expected it is too short for some awesome character developments. Still I liked one of the mains just because she was  awesomely cute and that\'s it. This time the two mains:AIHARA ENJU is one of the cutest anime characters I\'ve ever seen. She is always so optimistic and caring, yet determine and persistent. Enju is a strong ten-year-old and I am sure that she would have grow into a great character later on. Her main goal in the series, how I thought, was just a place she could belonged to.SATOMI RENTAROU is a...normal character. There is nothing much to talk about him. He is nice and caring and very strong because of his ""metal""(or whatever that material is) arm and leg. He is also very brave and self-sacrificing. The moment I liked him the most is when he realized that he might have become a cold-blooded killer and became scared of that thought.AnimationImpressive. That\'s the word that describes the animation of this anime show. The monsters are nicely designed, not too much, not boring but special. The animation shone the most in the action scenes and I found it very enjoyable to watch.ConclusionThis is an action, Sci-Fi anime that is perfect for a lazy Sunday. Thirteen episodes are really enough to tell this kind of story. Funny moments made it even more amusing and the step-by-step developing story and a couple of little plot-twists fit in perfectly with the main plot. It is not one of the best anime I have watched so far but it is kinda cute and interesting so give it a try. I would rate it as a 7,67 soo...good enough.Your AnimeGirl that they can turn people into monsters when they infect them with the virus. Still, the virus can effect the people in another way.

Anime Review No.1The Anime Black Bullet is an adaptation of the the source material with the same name. I never read the Light Novel before I rather choose to see the adaptation first before reading because I knew once I read the Light Novel I will badly judge the adaptation. What I see in as anime viewer the plot is decent and interesting since I am fan in apocalyptic themed series. The art style is good and average. The characters are...well balanced in Male and Female characters no harem is building up but certainly the loli characters the ""Cursed Children"" which all girls are not appealing since I not a lolicon to begin with but I like children but not in a lv of a lolicon. The Sound not very worth remembering it will just took 2-3 days before I can forget the song both the OP and ED. Enjoyment well I did get the small fraction of the hype but still I deemed it so boring and I multi task just to tolerate the scene which I see boring and irrelevant. Overall I give a 4 which is my standard good. This is anime is not best recommended cause it is not too memorable and to be sure it is not worth watching for non-anime fans. well balanced in Male and Female characters no harem is building up but certainly the loli characters the ""Cursed Children"" which all girls are not appealing since I not a lolicon to begin with but I like children but not in a lv of a lolicon.

Then I came back to watch it lately.Going over each criteria one by one --Story: This show has a fairly simple premise. It\'s similar to Muv Luv, God Eater and Attack on Titans in that it\'s humans fighting for the survival of humanity against some end-of-the-world science fiction or fantasy threat. Replace the Beta of Muv Luv, or the Aragami of God Eaters or the Titans in Attack on Titans with Gastrea and you have Black Bullet. It\'s not post apocalyptic per se, however. This show also tries to explore the concept...of racism a bit, albeit only partially successful in its attempt.Characters: Almost all memorable characters in this show has backgrounds that explain their stance or decision to do Heel-Face Turns.  The most important characters also have some degree of development, but unfortunately it\'s not anything too major. Kisara\'s development towards the end however was not so enjoyable. It also feels as if there was more that could have been done for this story\'s characters but due to the 13 episode time limit, it comes to an abrupt halt as the anime ends.Art: Excellent art and use of colors. Definitely appears polished in animation style and remains modern looking even in 2017. Beautiful backgrounds as well.Sound: Excellent OP theme by fripSide. Most of the time, I skip the opening theme but for this show I actually go out of my way to watch it every episode. The background OST, while not memorable, also does its job. ED song by Nagi Yanagi is excellent as well.Enjoyment: While no show is going to be a masterpiece for everyone, I for one thoroughly enjoyed this. The few points this could have improved on would have been to show a few others who appreciate the abilities and efforts of the ""Cursed Children"". It would have improved the realism of the writers\' attempt to portray the racism against them.Who\'s this show for:-action lovers (it\'s not just an action flick though)-people who like modern anime artstyles-sci-fi fans.-loli lovers. Rampant amounts of them in this show. Just be warned that Break the Cutie is a rampant trope here as well.-people who like serious things happening with serious consequencesWho\'s this not for:-people who want a light-hearted series-people who want realism or down-to-earth characters/dislike OP characters-people who want deeper characterization than what 13 episodes are able to offer-people who want a plot conclusive series of racism a bit, albeit only partially successful in its attempt.Characters: Almost all memorable characters in this show has backgrounds that explain their stance or decision to do Heel-Face Turns.

I have mixed feelings about the show, especially due to the final episode. Throughout the show, I thoroughly enjoy the story and characters, but there are flaws.The story doesn\'t seem to have a continuing conflict or arc, but many small arcs that last for a few episodes at a time and don\'t connect very well. A lot of the character\'s own stories are either untold or not expanded upon enough I found and that didn\'t help with the immersion, but it can tend to be overlooked at times.The last episodes leave a lot to be...desired and are a bit forced. The rapid change in the standpoints of good and bad in characters is too much for the time they\'re introduced. Many characters seemingly appear and disappear throughout, and the deaths of some characters don\'t make you feel all that bad about their loss because of this.My final vice is a bit odd but not misplaced (SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER, BUT NOT REALLY)The fact that Rentaro breaks down in the final moments of the last episode because he feels desensitized to the deaths of his comrades feels misplaced and forced to the extreme. Very little explanation and reasoning behind this and the fact that Enju tells him they\'ll be ""together forever"" makes the scene feel so out of place that I was uncomfortable with it. That being said, I may have misread the scene or have missed some contributing factor that makes it more understandable (Please feel free to correct me via a message if this is the case).In the end, while I enjoyed the majority of it, the pace of the show, misplacement of factors and underdevelopment of characters and plot points put this show at a 6 for me.

Please watch it and put in your own viewpoints on it as everyone has different opinions on such things, and the comments of one reviewer have no effect on the overall greatness or shortcomings of any work, be it a show, book, play or others.', 'Check out the video review here: https://youtu.be/wf_Mk6N6Iq4In 2011 Japanese Author, Shiden Kanzaki wrote a manga that to me is one of the best stories to date. Do you know which one I\'m refering to? Come on.. you know. Ok, I\'ll give you a hint, kick ass little girls. I\'m Talking about Black Bullet. This series is one that remains on my ""re-watch"" list, constantly, and no.. not because of the kick ass little girls, or the Hot katana wielding chick Kisara. But because of the endless emotional rollorcoaster and lessons that the story relays, and i would be lying out right if i said i...did not shed a tear at all while watching this series._________________The year is 2021 and mankind is facing a war against an awful epidemic called gastrea that has the power to mutate it\'s victoms on contact. Our Main protagonist Rentaro Satomi and his adorable twin-tailed side kick Enju Aihara are part of a Special Security team that specializes in extinguishing the gastrea. Enju is Known as a cursed child, The cursed children, are children who were effected by the epidemic at birth, but not to the point of mutation.

Which is sad, because the lost children are human,  and are just trying to be accepted as people, and co-exist. I won\'t go any further into it than that, but I do believe this series teaches us the importance of not being prejudice, and not to judge or forsake others just because they are a little different.

But then it all went downhill from there. The pace became significantly slow than when it started out and going to ward the end, the pace only went up back by a little. The character buildup and trying to make me feel sad for what\'s going on wasn\'t executed well. I had heard there were some tearjerker scenes but I didn\'t feel sad not even once. Not even close to crying.I did enjoy it to an extent that...I could say it was good, but nothing more. Usually when an anime is very good to me, I end up binge watching all the way through. For this anime I couldn\'t I had to to take break periods during the mid section of it where it became ridiculously slow, and tried to be ""meaningful"". The action and art was nice though, and I liked the ending theme.When it came to the characters, I could have seen a lot of potential from that masked guy. Every time he was in an episode, it got me interested for sure. I guess that\'s the way the story was written, to have that large section of slowness.

Though not super mind-blowing in terms of action and plot, it is certainly worth watching. What I like most about this one is two particular qualities. First, I like the relationship between the characters. You have the two member fighting team of the protagonist, a 17ish year old boy who has seen some pain but is headstrong and his sidekick, a superhuman 10 year old who is perky and quirky and loves teasing the main character about them getting married someday. They keep each other grounded very well, the boy being the stern older brother who needs cheering up and the girl who...needs a leash for her superhuman power and someone to look after her. Second, I love the tragedy of the show. It's a tear-jerker for certain and so far only a few anime have drawn me to tears, Clannad Afterstory and Angel Beats included. As the show progresses you see loss, struggle, and despair among some very likable characters. This show, however, falls short in terms of action and plot that stands out like Attack on Titan and Cowboy Bebop. This show is great for a good case of the feels though, which is why I recommend it. needs a leash for her superhuman power and someone to look after her. Second, I love the tragedy of the show.

I think this whole post apocalyptic/ dystopias are becoming increasingly popular this year in western and anime world. I think the concept is interesting however,is it just me or is the story feeling very rushed at times? I feel like i've missed certain parts of the plot somewhere along the line. just wanted to know if anyone felt that way too. "", ""This is an anime that has obviously been rushed, one of which has one of the best stories and background lore to its title adding many themes and ideas such as racism, what it means to be human as well as the meaning of life and the causalities in war. The makers have tried really hard to finish it as quick as they can and that can obviously be seen through the dullness in the characters and how really there aren't any tear jerking scenes AT all in a genre such as this. But mainly what I am trying to say is as far as...this anime goes in its 13 episodes, it failed because they could HAVE done much better and much more. It mainly felt like 'oh, this person died, what do we do now, whatever, get over it, fight seen and back to trying to be emotional all in one episode'. My final verdict is a 5 at my sincere disappointment in how they screwed up one of the best stories that could have been made. this anime goes in its 13 episodes, it failed because they could HAVE done much better and much more.

At first glance, it looked to me quite promising, or at least worth watching.Story 6/10: A classic scenario, humanity against aliens, is forced to fight and defend itself. Walls are erected around their territory in order to protect them from Gastreas, the name given to these aliens. This scenario basically reminds somehow of the popular Shingeki No Kyojin. However, the survival aspect of this apocalyptic show is not really present.Art 8/10 - Sound 7/10: The art is great. I am quite picky when it comes to the art of...an anime, and I cannot watch anything without good graphics, decent animation, and good soundtracks, even if the story is exceptionnal. This show met my requirements art-wise, even if the opening will (also?) reminds you of the one from Shingeki No Kyojin.Character 6/10: There is different type of characters in this show. There is the loli girl category, who are also the last hope of humanity, since they can display extraterrestrial strength. There is the protagonist, Satomi Rentarou. Quite a stereotype, pretty blend, and pretty similar to Kirito from Sword Art Online. He is also quite the strong type of guy, even if he does not look that invincible. And then, the characters who should have been more on screen maybe, the bad guys. Especially Hiruko Kagetane actually, a mysterious character, who is unfortunately still left in his secrets by the end of the show.I cannot say that these characters is a great team, and that is definitely not the strong point of this anime, but they do their job, which should be enough if you are only looking for some entertainment.Enjoyment 8/10: Now, I hqve said several times that this show reminds of SnK. BUT this show is not SnK. Loli scenes are here to prove it. Good thing? Well, this actually depends on you. But one thing is certain, the fights are really enjoyable. Great variety of fights, everything is used, being snipers, bombs, cameras, as well as the battleground itself.In the end, was that show a good show to watch? Well, by the end of the show, we are a bit left wanting for more, 13 episodes feel too short. In 24, characters could have developed a better personality, and the show could have started rolling for real. Despite all these flaws, I enjoyed this show a lot, and I didn't feel like I wasted my time.

That\'s the most crucial thing about some shows that are bordering between decent and good. Sometimes, there\'s just more time necessary to finally flesh out all the characters and plot.Black Bullet is fairly fast paced. Thirteen episodes, the plot develops acceptably reasonably, there\'s not too many deus ex machina moments that make you go ""Which hole did that plot-device come from?"" Although there are many moments that I feel like should have been completely taken out or required more explanation. Take for example, the ending of episode four. I was thinking about that for a good couple...of hours, yet I got no closure on what happens, because it\'s never brought up again.Anyways, I rate on enjoyment. On the wonderful rainbow scale of enjoyment, I gave Black Bullet an 8. Quick synopsis.Story: Fair (6)Post-apocalyptic, sci-fi. Humanity is on the brink of extinction, all that keeps them alive are gigantic monoliths of Varanium, which repel the Gastrea. Gastrea are (typically insectoid) monsters that can infect humans but mostly just butcher them into horrifying piles of blood, corpse, or just eat them. The combination of zombies, insects, parasites, vampires, and something that regenerates extremely fast.Art: Very Good (8)I don\'t know, I\'m not critical about art. It was nice, I recognize the characters. Very gory, too.Sound: Good (7)Epic battle themes, epic opening, melancholy ending. Fits the show.Character: Good (7)Got your typical characters, makes for a full house. Tsundere, yandere, plenty of lolis, and a kickass protagonist. Personally I do not think of any of them as basic or generic, because I do deem them to have unique flairs, if not an insane amount.Enjoyment: Very good (8)Short series, about 3-4 days if you\'re casual watcher. Enjoyable at the least, unless you\'re a technical detail nazi who checks for everything and hates everything.Overall: Good (7)Fix a bit of plot holes (Smashes holes into immortal snail mutants, crushes walls, jumps across roofs, cant break through the grip of two generic thugs) and plot twists that have nothing to do (episode four I\'m looking at you) with the plot.

The people who made this anime did a great job with the art, plot, characters, etc. The characters were strong, caring, realistic, etc. The art was amazing too, and the story line was so sad, and dramatic. This anime made me cry a lot, because of the great story line. The person who got me into anime told me to watch this anime, because it was HIS first anime, and now its one of my favorite animes ever, because of EVERYTHING about it. You guys need to watch this series. I bet 99% of you people will cry! ', 'HYPEOh such joy, a story based on a light novel; what could possibly go wrong when nobody could shut up during the pre-airing hype? Although Mahouka, which aired along with it, got most of the attension, the ones who wanted to steal a slice of the pie went as far as describing it “Attack On Titan in the near future”. Oh such joy; what could possibly go wrong when you plagiarize as much as you can get away with, by mentioning one of the most overhyped shows? Notice how it has a somewhat similar opening song, the same voice actor for the protagonist, and came...out in the same season.PREMISELet’s dig into the wonders of this anime. First of all you are never given the impression that humanity is on the verge of extinction by huge bugs and that there is some sort of horror/survival theme going on somewhere in here. Nobody cares about it. In fact, we don’t even see the population having anything to say about the bugs, since the plot centers immediately on the protagonist trying to stop some masked dude who wants to destroy the world for some contrived reason. What an amazing start that is definitely not building a story on weak foundations.FIRST IMPRESSIONSSpeaking of the protagonist, during his introduction, mere minutes into the first episode, we get one of the most retarded one-liners ever: “If you don’t want to die, survive Rentaro.” Yeah, and if you don’t want to be hungry, eat Rentaro. Turns out it was a very bad fansub translation but whatever; it was more than enough for the cracks to start appearing. Because immediately after that we get a time skip, which automatically means shit happened out of screen and all character progression jumped over a cliff to its doom.TIME SKIPAnd no, they didn’t use a time skip so they can remove all the boring parts. They skipped all the superpowers the protagonist got in that time period, just so they can fool the audience to think he is a normal teenager everybody can identify with, which is a very common trick in badly written stories. They try to make you think the protagonist is an average person like yourself. He is not that strong and tries his best to climb the lower steps of the power level hierarchy. Who wouldn’t identify with such a normal person? And then they gradually keep revealing super amazing skills only he was possessing since the beginning to make the audience think he is amazing for being a Jesus figure they are already rooting for as an otherwise normal person.MOOD SWINGSAs if that wasn’t enough of a problem, the story is trying its best to be as inconsistent as possible. Suffering from the same syndrome most edgy anime do, it thinks it is great to be dark and violent in one moment, followed by being light and comical in the immediate next moment. Having people screaming in horror as they are butchered to pieces, at the same time as having naked little girls who want to have sex with the protagonist, are clear signs of depth and maturity. What else could they be? Jump scares? As if investing time in making something only sad or only happy for more than five minutes will make the otakus to close the tab or something. I mean, who gives a damn about atmosphere or characterization anymore? Modern anime are all about naked little girls and senseless gore.APATHYSo you would think the anime would be mocked as soon as it began, but no, half the anime community was defending it with passion. They were saying if you live in a world where giant monsters attack daily and kill people, everybody will have normalized it and won’t react to it with fear. This is why running to buy beans with a discount right after you witness a guy killing your friends and almost yourself, is completely normal to them. It even makes it easier to explore the setting this way, since the characters will be reacting to everything in an apathetic way. It’s almost as if nobody thought IF THE CHARACTERS DON’T CARE, THE VIEWERS DON’T CARE EITHER. We don’t want them to be apathetic to their impending doom. We want them to react to it so there can be theme exploration. Not the absence of it.RUSHED PACINGThe anime also rushes to adapt multiple chapters per episode, to the point the pacing becomes frenetic. Everything happens in seconds and we then move to the next thing with no downtime to soak in what just happened. As a result, nothing has an impact on you.BAD WRITINGAnd don’t assume the anime would be fine if it had proper pacing, since the script is random bullshit. Especially the whole theme about the lolis being mistreated by evil adults because they have superpowers. Man, the people of this world are really asking for it; they know the only thing that can kill the monsters comes from those girls, and yet they kick away their only chance for survival, without ever explaining why. This is not a cotton plantation in southern America, ok? The girls are not after your jobs and you don’t hate them because their skin has a different color. They are the only thing that keeps you alive. Hell, they are strong enough to kill you all at the age of ten. So why are you being such assholes for no good reason? Because they are cartoony villains in a badly written story, that’s why.DEVIANCEAs you can probably guess, the only reason this stupid thing happens, is for victimizing the girls, and making the protagonist seem like a Good Samaritan whenever he helps them out as one of the few people who is NOT a stupid adult with a death wish. He loves these lolis and does his best to make a pedophile’s paradise out of them. And the show promotes that as funny instead of cringe worthy. Because Japan is being Japan.MEANINGLESS ELEMENTSSo, anyways, he is a teenager and he goes to a Japanese high school. Why is there a high school in a post apocalyptic setting? Because light novel writers are incapable to write a story without one. Is he at least learning martial arts or something useful for surviving in that place? Nope, the school exists for no reason at all. And the person who gives him jobs to go around killing monsters while making sure not to be late for school every morning is a school girl with huge bouncing boobs who is obviously in love with him for no reason other than light novels. So, when he is not killing monsters or going to a school where he learns and does nothing, our heroic protagonist spends his time home, where he has endless excuses for hentai doujins to be made, since he is constantly being sexually assaulted by either horny little girls, or big breasted high school girls.PASSIVE PROTAGONISTBy the way, do you know what his objective in the story is? He has none! He is just following orders by the very retarded adults who want to be exterminated, thus in effect he is a boring public servant with no vision or goals in life. And the story is so badly written that he never explains why he doesn’t just join the masked dude and kill all those racist idiots. This way he can create a just nation of super lolis with him as the emperor. He is strong enough to do that, he obviously fights for justice, and really likes those super lolis, SO WHY DOESN’T HE DO IT? No reason given. Why is this guy even the protagonist?LOLI SIDEKICKHis super loli on the other hand is a far better character. Cute, powerful, has a tragic life, and is even willing to be naked all the time and have sex with you just to show you her affection. Who wouldn’t like that? By the way, she is ten. But love knows no boundaries, right? Anyways, whatever drama they were trying to build around her being mistreated for being special is magically resolved after a few minutes, so all the interest you could have shown about her as a character instead of a jailbait evaporates fast.VILLAINThe only other character who is barely worth a mention is the masked evil dude, and only because he was OP for 3 episodes. Seriously, this guy could brush off any fighter in the show and keep going on his quest to destroy the world because… err, discrimination shit and because he was made to destroy stuff. But hey, he was awesome as a cartoony villain and it’s complete bullshit how he got defeated the fourth time he fought the protagonist. That’s right, the fourth. He had the chance to kill him three times in a row and didn’t because the script said so. He killed everybody else who stood in his way, but not our hero who is protected by the plot armor of bullshit.ASSPULLSAnd the way he got defeated was one of the biggest asspulls in history. The protagonist reveals out of nowhere that he was a cyborg or some shit, and kicks the crap out of him. Not only it was completely anti-climactic, it also made it seem like Rentaro was all-powerful since the very beginning and yet didn’t use his skills to trash the masked dude since episode one. By not doing so, hundreds of people were killed, and the city was almost destroyed. And of course his booby supervisor didn’t bother to tell anyone about it all this time. She just allowed hundreds of innocent people to have undeserved deaths. Nothing to see here, people, moving on.AUTISMAnd of course, nobody bothered to accuse the hero for doing such a horrible thing, which led to the easily avoidable loss of half their military defenses against the bugs. But it’s ok, since they also didn’t reward Rentaro for saving the city. Seriously, the next episode begins and everybody acts like there never was a masked dude or they never were a step away from annihilation. Why is everybody ignoring this walking atomic bomb? Why is he going to a school where he does nothing, instead of being the elite protector of the city? Because light novels are being light novels.RETARDED DRAMASpecial mention to how despite all that bullshit, the author is still constantly trying to present Rentaro as some tragic figure who is insecure and afraid he is not capable enough. There is a scene where he is about to shoot a huge monster that is about to destroy the city. He is a proficient gunner, he has a clear shot, nobody is trying to throw his aiming off, and yet out of nowhere he is acting scared and doubts his overpowered skills. With him having shown no weaknesses, and with no time invested on his fears so far, that scene was trying to create drama out of nothing and came off as completely retarded.EXPOSITIONAll this time I didn’t mention the worst problem this show has that completely eclipses all the other issues, and that is its terrible exposition. Everything is told, nothing is shown. And by everything, I mean even the most fundamental information is thrown at our faces. Everybody talks in a completely fake way, telling us things that normally would never be mentioned. A simple scene would play out like this:“Hello woman of the organization that gave me the bullets. What are you doing in my apartment, on the fourth floor, during the afternoon? You want me to cook you some fried fish because you are hungry? Ok, sit next to that sofa that was given to me by my uncle. In the meantime I will start cooking. Look, I am cooking. I cook the fish. See? Fish.”IN CONCLUSIONPlain ridiculous. Black Bullet is a very good example of everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. There is nothing to like in it, unless you are not thinking while you are watching, and all you care for is to laugh at the harem lead trying to run away from horny naked ten year olds who want to have sex with him, before he pulls a magic trinket out of his ass and saves the day. Light novels in a nutshell. out in the same season.PREMISELet’s dig into the wonders of this anime.

Because Japan is being Japan.MEANINGLESS ELEMENTSSo, anyways, he is a teenager and he goes to a Japanese high school. Why is there a high school in a post apocalyptic setting? Because light novel writers are incapable to write a story without one. Is he at least learning martial arts or something useful for surviving in that place? Nope, the school exists for no reason at all. And the person who gives him jobs to go around killing monsters while making sure not to be late for school every morning is a school girl with huge bouncing boobs who is obviously in love with him for no reason other than light novels. So, when he is not killing monsters or going to a school where he learns and does nothing, our heroic protagonist spends his time home, where he has endless excuses for hentai doujins to be made, since he is constantly being sexually assaulted by either horny little girls, or big breasted high school girls.PASSIVE PROTAGONISTBy the way, do you know what his objective in the story is? He has none! He is just following orders by the very retarded adults who want to be exterminated, thus in effect he is a boring public servant with no vision or goals in life. And the story is so badly written that he never explains why he doesn’t just join the masked dude and kill all those racist idiots. This way he can create a just nation of super lolis with him as the emperor. He is strong enough to do that, he obviously fights for justice, and really likes those super lolis, SO WHY DOESN’T HE DO IT? No reason given. Why is this guy even the protagonist?LOLI SIDEKICKHis super loli on the other hand is a far better character. Cute, powerful, has a tragic life, and is even willing to be naked all the time and have sex with you just to show you her affection. Who wouldn’t like that? By the way, she is ten. But love knows no boundaries, right? Anyways, whatever drama they were trying to build around her being mistreated for being special is magically resolved after a few minutes, so all the interest you could have shown about her as a character instead of a jailbait evaporates fast.VILLAINThe only other character who is barely worth a mention is the masked evil dude, and only because he was OP for 3 episodes. Seriously, this guy could brush off any fighter in the show and keep going on his quest to destroy the world because… err, discrimination shit and because he was made to destroy stuff. But hey, he was awesome as a cartoony villain and it’s complete bullshit how he got defeated the fourth time he fought the protagonist. That’s right, the fourth. He had the chance to kill him three times in a row and didn’t because the script said so. He killed everybody else who stood in his way, but not our hero who is protected by the plot armor of bullshit.ASSPULLSAnd the way he got defeated was one of the biggest asspulls in history. The protagonist reveals out of nowhere that he was a cyborg or some shit, and kicks the crap out of him. Not only it was completely anti-climactic, it also made it seem like Rentaro was all-powerful since the very beginning and yet didn’t use his skills to trash the masked dude since episode one. By not doing so, hundreds of people were killed, and the city was almost destroyed. And of course his booby supervisor didn’t bother to tell anyone about it all this time. She just allowed hundreds of innocent people to have undeserved deaths. Nothing to see here, people, moving on.AUTISMAnd of course, nobody bothered to accuse the hero for doing such a horrible thing, which led to the easily avoidable loss of half their military defenses against the bugs. But it’s ok, since they also didn’t reward Rentaro for saving the city. Seriously, the next episode begins and everybody acts like there never was a masked dude or they never were a step away from annihilation. Why is everybody ignoring this walking atomic bomb? Why is he going to a school where he does nothing, instead of being the elite protector of the city? Because light novels are being light novels.RETARDED DRAMASpecial mention to how despite all that bullshit, the author is still constantly trying to present Rentaro as some tragic figure who is insecure and afraid he is not capable enough. There is a scene where he is about to shoot a huge monster that is about to destroy the city. He is a proficient gunner, he has a clear shot, nobody is trying to throw his aiming off, and yet out of nowhere he is acting scared and doubts his overpowered skills. With him having shown no weaknesses, and with no time invested on his fears so far, that scene was trying to create drama out of nothing and came off as completely retarded.EXPOSITIONAll this time I didn’t mention the worst problem this show has that completely eclipses all the other issues, and that is its terrible exposition. Everything is told, nothing is shown. And by everything, I mean even the most fundamental information is thrown at our faces. Everybody talks in a completely fake way, telling us things that normally would never be mentioned. A simple scene would play out like this:“Hello woman of the organization that gave me the bullets. What are you doing in my apartment, on the fourth floor, during the afternoon? You want me to cook you some fried fish because you are hungry? Ok, sit next to that sofa that was given to me by my uncle. In the meantime I will start cooking. Look, I am cooking. I cook the fish. See? Fish.”IN CONCLUSIONPlain ridiculous. Black Bullet is a very good example of everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. There is nothing to like in it, unless you are not thinking while you are watching, and all you care for is to laugh at the harem lead trying to run away from horny naked ten year olds who want to have sex with him, before he pulls a magic trinket out of his ass and saves the day. Light novels in a nutshell.', 'Black Bullet is an anime adaptation of a light novel with the same name. People often call this series as a rip-off of Attack on Titan, due to the similar premise.Story - 5/10The story takes place in a post-apocalypse Tokyo. Where giant bugs-robot-thingies called Gastraea. So our Protagonists must protect Tokyo from the Gastraea threat with the help of LOLIS!!!!First off, for a ""Post-Apocalypse"" world, Tokyo doesn\'t feel post-apocalyptic enough. People are still happily living in a clean environment with a working economy. It could be better if it actually shows us the effect of the past Gastraea Wars.Second off, the pacing. Overly rushed,...is an understatement. It\'s poorly done. One minute we\'re having a fanservice moment, and the next minute a Genocide occurred. I know this is based on a Light Novel, but a fast pacing can be acceptable if done well.Third off, the mood. They basically threw it out of the window. Black bullet tries too hard to be dark. But the loli moments and gritty moments basically cancel each other out. It switches from a comedic to dark in less then a minute. Therefore, it\'s a complete mess.So overall, the story is mediocre at best.Art - 7/10The art is done well enough to keep you entertained. The Gastraea\'s 3D models are really well done. It fits to the scene nicely.Although some battle scenes are really rushed, the art is one of this series\' best aspects.Sound - 7/10The soundtrack is great. The songs fit into the scene\'s mood perfectly. Whether the mood is comedic or dark. But as I said before, since the mood was a complete throw-off, the songs aren\'t really memorable.Character - 3/10This is where it starts going down hill. Like, really down. Most of the characters felt bland and empty. But when there\'s an interesting character, they either don\'t get much development and screen time, or just killed instantly.Rentaro, the main protagonist, is just a usual ""I-want-to-protect-everybody""-kind of guy. Which, by the way, can be found in most shonen materials. Whether it\'s anime or manga. Nothing is really different about him.But the rest of the crew is just bland. Enju is too annoying, and Kisara is a typical Tsundere (Even though she changed at the very last episode, it didn\'t do much for her character.) Tina is the most interesting one, but even then, she didn\'t get the character development she deserved.But what really killed this for me is that this series has a bad, BAD, set of antagonists. You have the Kisara\'s grandpa person, which was revealed to be evil AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE. Then you have the Osaka-president guy, who is just your plain ""Rule-the-world"" bad guy. We have Kisara\'s older brother, which just appeared and was revealed to be evil AT THE VERY LAST GODDAMN MINUTE.And the most annoying antagonist I\'ve ever known, the Bodyguard guy. (Nobody remember his name anyway) His motivation to be evil and hate Rentaro is just... UGH!!!Kagetane and his daughter, Kohina, is the only redeeming ones. But then again, as I said before, Didn\'t get enough development.Overall - 6/10This anime tried to mark itself as a Dark Action Seinen with a dash of Loliness. Which at the end failed to do. Miserably.But if you can get past the weak setting, and bland characters, you might just enjoy this anime for what it is. A mess of Gritty and Loli-y moments slapped together. is an understatement.

However, it leaves you wanting more. At times it feels like there should be more buildup before the climatic finish occurs. It ends up being alright though because the show gets right back in the swing of things after every climax. Long story short, there is not a lot of down time in the anime. It moves at a fast pace throughout the season.You might enjoy this if: You are a fan of Attack on Titan. Is has a similar feel to it in that...humanity is nearly extinct and they must do whatever it takes to survive.You might not like it if: You want a story arc that remains consistent throughout an entire season. The stories bounce around a lot.Note to the Viewer: Just when you think you have figured out where the story is going and what genre this anime is, the anime will switch it up on you.

However, compared to the thrilling experience i had with SNK, Black Bullet kind of disappointed me.Let's start with the story: The premise for this anime is amazing by itself, a virus that turns humans into monsters, and the remnants of humanity being trapped within protected areas (recognize anything?). With the setting I have no problem. Then we get to the actual fights. Oh boy, here we go. A common pattern in Black Bullet is that a...seemingly insurmountable threat or responsibility is placed in front of the protagonist to deal with, usually having a few episodes of build-up before the fight to show how much of a challenge the upcoming match will be. Then the confrontation with the great danger occurs, and the protagonist defeats the enemy in a few minutes, sometimes even a few seconds, with hardly any hassle at all; whether it was because there was something convenient lying around, or the protagonist had some hidden power that was unknown until now. See the problem? I think the main reason for this is because pace of the anime was extremely rushed, and BB could have used a full 25 or even 26 episode season instead of just a 12.Alright, let's get to the characters. For the most part, the characters in Black Bullet are all lovable and each have their own quirks and gimmicks that make each of them memorable in their own special way. As for their designs, nothing particularly special, just what we would usually expect from any anime.Overall, this is an okay anime; not very good, but then again, not very bad. For those who haven't seen this yet, I would suggest watching it just to watch it. seemingly insurmountable threat or responsibility is placed in front of the protagonist to deal with, usually having a few episodes of build-up before the fight to show how much of a challenge the upcoming match will be.

They provide enough of a backstory that you aren't lost, which allows you to more easily relate to the characters and be a part of the struggle. In terms of complexity the story is lacking because there is a clear distinction between who is fighting for good and who is evil. This doesn't take away from the story though because there is enough of a gray area so that there is an internal struggle for the viewer.The art...is what I would consider more than adequate, although not outstanding. I feel that there really isn't anything to complain about because it doesn't get in the way of the viewer's enjoyment.Mood is tragic and serious, but there is more than a sprinkle of comedic relief present as well. For that reason I could understand why some may say that the comedy is out of place when the plot is based on a dystopia. This is where I disagree because I felt that the comedic touches allowed for relief at points when the mood seemed to heavy.If you are looking for something with a serious, but not down right depressing show with an adequate story you have come to the right place. is what I would consider more than adequate, although not outstanding.

However, when they do crossover, they all share a common theme of proving time and time again that cartoons can be intricate, intense, mature, thought provoking for adults, and, overall, deeply reflective. Last Spring Season, there were three shows that all had crossover potential and delivered (Gargantia On The Verderous Planet, Flowers Of Evil, and Attack On Titan, which is currently a huge hit...on Adult Swim). Black Bullet is another one of those shows that show crossover potential within it’s great animation and engaging premise.In the year, 2021, Mankind has been decimated by a virus called Gastrea. This virus, when infecting humans, causes them to turn into giant beasts of many different species that feed on flesh of human beings. In order for the remainder of the human race to stay safe from these mutated creatures, they must live in a wall made of varanium monoliths, a metal used to combat the Gastrea beasts. Soon children that were born with the virus, yet are able to control it and have superpowers, were discovered. (For some reason, these cursed children can only be female and seem to peak at the age of 10…more on that later..) Within the ten years after the virus hit, a team called Civil Securities have been formed to fight against the Gastrea with the Initiator (the cursed child) and the Promoter (who leads the cursed child). Now it’s up to our main protagonist, Rentaro Satomi, and his Initiator, Enju Aihara, to be put on a mission to prevent the destruction of Tokyo.The fact that the description above was explained in the last three minutes of the first episode shows that this show is hell bent on covering a lot of detail as fast as possible. The problem is that it ever seems to slow down. If the viewer falls behind, eventually that viewer will fall completely out of the loop. Thus, the experience gets frustrating. Those that do succeed in catching up are so focused on paying attention to all the details that they’ll end up not feeling as impacted by the moments that are meant to be impacting. An example of this happens in episode four, when a character, who played a key role in the first arc, dies. Not only was there nothing building up to it (she was discovered severely injured and had her life ended coup de grace) but the plot had to move along quickly, so there was no time to dwell on that tragedy. In fact, the following episodes almost indicated that she never existed. Every episode is like that. For the most part, no time is left to reflect on the characters due to the absurdly fast pace the story is moving and the large amounts of boring info-dump scenes in between every fight scene.The best part of the story, however are the themes of the show. As mentioned before, children that have these Gastrea powers are known as “cursed children”. While some of them work as Initiators to defend humanity from the Gastrea, others are ostracized from society due to the fear that they might go berserk and kill people with their tremendous power. So the girls usually keep their identity hidden or they have no place to go (even parents would abandon them).The girls that are Initiators have their own problems. Some of them, like Enju, are treated like normal children when they’re not fighting giant monsters. However, some Promoters (the adults that works with the Initiators) treat their Initiators as tools, completely denying their humanity. Rentaro, who is the Promoter that looks after Enju, believes that all these girls aren’t evil by nature and should all be cared for instead of being used or neglected based on their genetic traits. Sadly, he can’t create that perfect world alone. He even goes out of his way to make small school for the cursed children, at one point, only for it to result in tragic consequences. This is the sole human element of Black Bullet that was bound to resonate with the viewer. No child, no matter what they were born with or into, should have their human rights denied.That theme should’ve been what could bring the show over the hump from being an average show to a good show. However, the writers managed to mess even that part up. It wasn’t just the rushed and clumsy pacing that caused the emotional involvement of the viewer to be nonexistent. It was the portrayal of the cursed children. It seems like the original author of the source material (Black Bullet was adapted from a light novel) was so insecure about his writing that he felt as if the only way for the reader to feel engaged was to appeal to otaku and lolicons. What was so wrong about having little boys as cursed children as well? That wouldn’t have changed the focus at all. In fact, it probably would have made it an even bigger focus. Here’s the thing: that may not have been the focus at all. This is where the writing shows its biggest weaknesses.Starting with Enju, she seems like a spunky, playful girl that’s poised and confident when it matters. While that can make her a very cool character, this ten year old girl also talks about wanting to fully consummate a relationship with Rentaro. She’ll flirt with him by saying naughty things to him, seduce him by trying to sleep with him or get him to take a bath with her, etc. She seems very much aware of what she’s saying while also being petite, playful, and wearing twin-tails. That just reeks of lolicon bait. A lot of girls are portrayed differently but with the same idea in mind. At the final arc of the show, four Promoters and their Initiators form a team for the final battle. That team of Initiators consists of Enju, Yuzuki (the token tsundere), Midori (a shy neko loli), and Tina Sprout (an initially lethargic girl with very little awareness that the collar of her PJs always slips off and exposes her shoulder). There are other girls in the show that are usually portrayed in similar fashion. If they don’t have personalities catering to an otaku’s specific tastes, they at least have an uninspired loli/moe based design and personality. If this was just your run-of-the-mill lolicon/otakucentric romantic comedy that wasn’t meant to be taken seriously, it could just be treated as stupid fun at best. However this show takes itself seriously and wants the audience to feel empathy for these girls. However, these aren’t realistically written characters. They’re fetishy, otakucentric stereotypes designed to cater to a specific audience for the most part. Therefor, it makes it a fantasy. Therefor, all logic gets tossed out the window. Therefor, those that are disgusted by it won’t give a damn about the characters.There is a question I would ask to all the lolicons that did like the show. How can you care about the welfare of these prepubescent girls if you’re also having sexual fantasies about them? You can’t possibly do both. How can this show be sensitive about all the abuse and neglect these girls go through if they’re also throwing in lolita jokes and portraying them as lolicon bait. The show can’t do both. It’s the way these girls are depicted that severely undermine the story to the point that even the most serious of moments feel hollow.The way the other characters are written aren’t any better. Rentaro always means well, striving for justice and doing the right thing. Other than his intense emotion and zeal, that’s all there is to his character. Maybe that’s why so many girls, young and old, like him so much… What seemed interesting was his witnessing his parents dying in the first scene of episode one. It would’ve been nice to know more about his back-story to help flesh out his character. The same can be said about everyone else. Kisara is essentially Rentaro’s boss and childhood friend. She certainly plays the “childhood friend” anime character very well too. She has big boobs, she’s badass, and she has a secret crush on Rentaro (because of course she would, silly readers). Other characters seem to come off as either creepy low-lives or stereotypes that don’t seem to mean much in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, they’re not worth talking about. There is one consistent villain that did seem very interesting. The villain, Kagetane, was also a Promoter with his own daughter, Kohina, as his Initiator. However, he has his own ideas about saving the world and that is too destroy and rebuild. He disappeared for several episodes and then reappeared near the end. Even he didn’t get much explained about him and there seemed to be so much more to explain about his character and his daughter. Everything about this Black Bullet screams “wasted potential” so far.The art is uninspired, with the exception of how some of the Gastrea monsters are designed. More imagination on how these monsters look, which are basically mutated forms of different animals, seemed to have been utilized more. Character designs themselves seem to look the same as every other anime but that’s probably the point. It’s trying to be safe and appeal to otaku, after all.The animation, on the other hand, is superb. There was a lot of passion being put into the rendering the action scenes especially and if there is any reason to watch the show, it’s the fun factor regarding said scenes. It’s not always consistent, however. The frame rate does tend to slow down significantly when characters are talking each others ear off to transparently explain the plot to the viewer.The music also made the show entertaining to watch with electronica techno beats with chamber choirs to build up the intensity of the fight scenes. The opening theme (by FripSide) and the ending theme (by Yanagi Nagi) were all animated and performed with a lot passion, despite being made for a show with passionless content.The voice acting was effective as well, with only one stand-out. Despite the shallow character that Rentaro was, Yuki Kaji (best known as Eren Yeager from Attack On Titan) did well to emote his voice and bring out the most of his character. He had every opportunity to sound like the standard anime hero but he did everything he could to bring out the intense emotion that made Rentaro seemingly interesting.It would be harsh to call this show a beautifully disturbing waste of time, but that’s what it is. With the premise and the ideas it had in place, it could’ve been more than worthwhile watch with enough crossover potential to make this even a hit on Toonami. But with the lolicon/otaku pandering, the terrible writing, and the overall desire to restrict it’s audience to the safest areas possible instead of being ambitious makes this show disappointing and unable to be taken seriously or get emotionally invested in it. It’s a shame the story wasn’t pitched to a better writer. It’s sad to say that whoever wrote Black Bullet needs to start from scratch. But first, he would need to know how to write better before attempting something too ambitious again. on Adult Swim). Black Bullet is another one of those shows that show crossover potential within it’s great animation and engaging premise.In the year, 2021, Mankind has been decimated by a virus called Gastrea.

Not only was there nothing building up to it (she was discovered severely injured and had her life ended coup de grace) but the plot had to move along quickly, so there was no time to dwell on that tragedy. In fact, the following episodes almost indicated that she never existed. Every episode is like that. For the most part, no time is left to reflect on the characters due to the absurdly fast pace the story is moving and the large amounts of boring info-dump scenes in between every fight scene.The best part of the story, however are the themes of the show. As mentioned before, children that have these Gastrea powers are known as “cursed children”. While some of them work as Initiators to defend humanity from the Gastrea, others are ostracized from society due to the fear that they might go berserk and kill people with their tremendous power. So the girls usually keep their identity hidden or they have no place to go (even parents would abandon them).The girls that are Initiators have their own problems. Some of them, like Enju, are treated like normal children when they’re not fighting giant monsters. However, some Promoters (the adults that works with the Initiators) treat their Initiators as tools, completely denying their humanity. Rentaro, who is the Promoter that looks after Enju, believes that all these girls aren’t evil by nature and should all be cared for instead of being used or neglected based on their genetic traits. Sadly, he can’t create that perfect world alone. He even goes out of his way to make small school for the cursed children, at one point, only for it to result in tragic consequences. This is the sole human element of Black Bullet that was bound to resonate with the viewer. No child, no matter what they were born with or into, should have their human rights denied.That theme should’ve been what could bring the show over the hump from being an average show to a good show. However, the writers managed to mess even that part up. It wasn’t just the rushed and clumsy pacing that caused the emotional involvement of the viewer to be nonexistent. It was the portrayal of the cursed children. It seems like the original author of the source material (Black Bullet was adapted from a light novel) was so insecure about his writing that he felt as if the only way for the reader to feel engaged was to appeal to otaku and lolicons. What was so wrong about having little boys as cursed children as well? That wouldn’t have changed the focus at all. In fact, it probably would have made it an even bigger focus. Here’s the thing: that may not have been the focus at all. This is where the writing shows its biggest weaknesses.Starting with Enju, she seems like a spunky, playful girl that’s poised and confident when it matters. While that can make her a very cool character, this ten year old girl also talks about wanting to fully consummate a relationship with Rentaro. She’ll flirt with him by saying naughty things to him, seduce him by trying to sleep with him or get him to take a bath with her, etc. She seems very much aware of what she’s saying while also being petite, playful, and wearing twin-tails. That just reeks of lolicon bait. A lot of girls are portrayed differently but with the same idea in mind. At the final arc of the show, four Promoters and their Initiators form a team for the final battle. That team of Initiators consists of Enju, Yuzuki (the token tsundere), Midori (a shy neko loli), and Tina Sprout (an initially lethargic girl with very little awareness that the collar of her PJs always slips off and exposes her shoulder). There are other girls in the show that are usually portrayed in similar fashion. If they don’t have personalities catering to an otaku’s specific tastes, they at least have an uninspired loli/moe based design and personality. If this was just your run-of-the-mill lolicon/otakucentric romantic comedy that wasn’t meant to be taken seriously, it could just be treated as stupid fun at best. However this show takes itself seriously and wants the audience to feel empathy for these girls. However, these aren’t realistically written characters. They’re fetishy, otakucentric stereotypes designed to cater to a specific audience for the most part. Therefor, it makes it a fantasy. Therefor, all logic gets tossed out the window. Therefor, those that are disgusted by it won’t give a damn about the characters.There is a question I would ask to all the lolicons that did like the show. How can you care about the welfare of these prepubescent girls if you’re also having sexual fantasies about them? You can’t possibly do both. How can this show be sensitive about all the abuse and neglect these girls go through if they’re also throwing in lolita jokes and portraying them as lolicon bait. The show can’t do both. It’s the way these girls are depicted that severely undermine the story to the point that even the most serious of moments feel hollow.The way the other characters are written aren’t any better. Rentaro always means well, striving for justice and doing the right thing. Other than his intense emotion and zeal, that’s all there is to his character. Maybe that’s why so many girls, young and old, like him so much… What seemed interesting was his witnessing his parents dying in the first scene of episode one. It would’ve been nice to know more about his back-story to help flesh out his character. The same can be said about everyone else. Kisara is essentially Rentaro’s boss and childhood friend. She certainly plays the “childhood friend” anime character very well too. She has big boobs, she’s badass, and she has a secret crush on Rentaro (because of course she would, silly readers). Other characters seem to come off as either creepy low-lives or stereotypes that don’t seem to mean much in the grand scheme of things. Therefore, they’re not worth talking about. There is one consistent villain that did seem very interesting. The villain, Kagetane, was also a Promoter with his own daughter, Kohina, as his Initiator. However, he has his own ideas about saving the world and that is too destroy and rebuild. He disappeared for several episodes and then reappeared near the end. Even he didn’t get much explained about him and there seemed to be so much more to explain about his character and his daughter. Everything about this Black Bullet screams “wasted potential” so far.The art is uninspired, with the exception of how some of the Gastrea monsters are designed. More imagination on how these monsters look, which are basically mutated forms of different animals, seemed to have been utilized more. Character designs themselves seem to look the same as every other anime but that’s probably the point. It’s trying to be safe and appeal to otaku, after all.The animation, on the other hand, is superb. There was a lot of passion being put into the rendering the action scenes especially and if there is any reason to watch the show, it’s the fun factor regarding said scenes. It’s not always consistent, however. The frame rate does tend to slow down significantly when characters are talking each others ear off to transparently explain the plot to the viewer.The music also made the show entertaining to watch with electronica techno beats with chamber choirs to build up the intensity of the fight scenes. The opening theme (by FripSide) and the ending theme (by Yanagi Nagi) were all animated and performed with a lot passion, despite being made for a show with passionless content.The voice acting was effective as well, with only one stand-out. Despite the shallow character that Rentaro was, Yuki Kaji (best known as Eren Yeager from Attack On Titan) did well to emote his voice and bring out the most of his character. He had every opportunity to sound like the standard anime hero but he did everything he could to bring out the intense emotion that made Rentaro seemingly interesting.It would be harsh to call this show a beautifully disturbing waste of time, but that’s what it is. With the premise and the ideas it had in place, it could’ve been more than worthwhile watch with enough crossover potential to make this even a hit on Toonami. But with the lolicon/otaku pandering, the terrible writing, and the overall desire to restrict it’s audience to the safest areas possible instead of being ambitious makes this show disappointing and unable to be taken seriously or get emotionally invested in it. It’s a shame the story wasn’t pitched to a better writer. It’s sad to say that whoever wrote Black Bullet needs to start from scratch. But first, he would need to know how to write better before attempting something too ambitious again.', '*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*The story line is just mediocre, your typical ""humanity has gone to shits because we invented some crazy ass killing machine that is owning our asses hard so we set up various enclaves that are run by a sovereign"". A mediocre story line can be compensated for by good characters and execution. However, Black Bullet has got none of that right, AT ALL.What is really horrible about the story, is how they force it to be some sort of a desperate and cruel drama. I wouldn\'t be surprised if they suddenly showed a scene where they just throw hundred of babies in a mincer....I don\'t know what they were expecting but I literally laughed at how ridiculous it was when they just killed off the entire mutant classroom.The ""main essence"" of the plot (mutants and such) are just stupid as hell. They just made a blatant dumb excuse to include a cast of loli killers into the series. Imagine a plot, where girls can become powerful killing machine, only if they\'re 15 years old, have big tits because it depends on their milk content. Just think how dumb that sounds, that\'s the same thing as Black Bullet.Let\'s talk about character, it\'s just so awful and so goddamn plain. The protagonist is plain and bland, he\'s your typical anime ""that alright looking dude that appears to be plain at first but he really has this awesome power that gets EVEN MORE powerful at the end! also fights hard for his friends"".  That\'s all he is.His partner is just equally bland, the only ""special"" thing about her is her speech.Music wasn\'t really fit for the anime, I feel.Art is ok, your typical 2013-ish art style. I liked the loli designs, they\'re alright.In over all, I didn\'t really enjoy it, I just watched it for the cute lolis and just for the sake of ending it.So tl;dr story was typical, really bland and kept pushing out dumb shit to make it look like a drama anime, characters were really fucking lame, plot was made with a dumb excuse to have killer lolis.

The drawing style is really good the music suits what is happening in the anime so points for that all the characters have their own interesting relationship ^^ yet the initiators and  promoter fighting style was a great and interesting idea. But in my opinion they could have expanded the series to 24 episodes because it ended too quickly and some...stuff just felt unfinished.

A war against bugs isn\'t a new concept.  It resembles too much of ""Attack on Titan"". I can predict almost everything. Many suspend moments are forceful and unrealistic. *Spoiler* Characters/monsters are bound by a ranking system that isn’t reinforced by anything. Winning or losing (fast or slow) is all depended on the mood.Art 8/10: Characters look great. Monsters however are not. They are mostly clumps of meat with eyes (lacking...creativity).Sound 8/10: Nothing sounds wrong, but also nothing sounds great either. Again, theme music is very similar to “Attack on Titan”.Character 6/10: There is a big flaw; the power scale is all wrong. As a result, the main character doesn’t really grow as the story progresses. I got frustrated because he got beaten by random weak opponents to create suspend moments. The main character is friend/family of many powerful figures somehow afraid of random bad people.  He is a “part-time” badass ?!?Enjoyment 7/10: If I haven’t watched other animes, I would have enjoyed it more.

Not quite on par with other animes in this season.', 'It seems that many reviews this season on countless shows; seem to show a lot of negativity towards them. Black bullet was an example of this were people bagged a show due to over-analysing. It even seems that at some point all that these reviewers seem to do is sit down and review a tv show based off memory rather than how they enjoyed the show.  There seems to be next to no positive points about shows nowadays. Too many people have tried to compare these to great shows or different genres, and neglect to look at the fact this show is one in...its own. You also can\'t say they stole from other shows as those shows most likely stole from other shows. It\'s a never ending cycle.To start off i\'ll analyse some negative points about the show and the positivesAlthough it may not appeal to everyone, the opening and ending to this show was very good. It showed each of the characters like one usually does and puts some good music behind it (later on you would come to realise that this opening theme of this show would show  key points to this show).Story -7When we focus on the story and how it was portrayed, it was an okay plotline that focused on different aspects of the human conscience, including things such as racism, greed, despair and courage. Examples in the tv show are but not limited to: the young girls with powers, seitenshi sama\'s (leader of tokyo) bodyguards, the Gastrea\'s attacks and finally the final sacrifice. As any show though it has its failings. It tried to focus on too many aspects of the show rather than certain themes.Art - 7The art was quite good for this show and matched the themes quite nicely. Rentaro\'s varanium leg, arm and eye was well created and made him look ""cooler"". The rest of the show had some very neat art styling and during fight scenes it was easy to follow what was happening compared to other shows. It was made so you could clearly see each and every aspect of the fight without too much confusion.Sound - 6The sound during the show was moderately good. The only saving grace for the music was the opening and ending themes. There were parts littered here and there that didn\'t suite the theme at all. At other times there was no music or next to no music at all. I\'m not talking about parts were they are talking but some action scenes were missing a cool theme behind them. If they make a OST I wouldn\'t mind listening to it to make sure that this was completely fair.Character - 7Fairly straighforward characters, I was feeling generous when writing this review. They were okay and had their parts to them, although things such as the final fight between Kisara and.....(you\'ll have to find out ;)) was not really explained well and how she snapped but other than that it is fine. Typical of this anime is the lover vs lover genre and we can pretty much tell what is going to happen later on in time. Nevertheless the characters has voices that matched them nicely, they didn\'t have over the top designs and they added to the story quite well.Enjoyment - 8The tv show overall was quite enjoyable, with its many aspects coming together quite well. The other parts of the anime come together and fit quite nicely with each other. There were times that it was really slow but other than that if we focus on all these parts coming together then we can see that this show did quite well as an adaptation of the light novel\'s.Overall - 7.5This show was a good adaptation of the manga and provided the story well at times and the central idea behind it. If we envision what Shiden Kanzaki was trying to aim for when writing the light novels, then we can thoroughly enjoy this story. I will be eagerly awaiting a second season. its own.

I loved the first arc loved it! But after ep. 5 or 6 this series just turns into a shallow harem with a dark tone. every episode after that the characters were just getting dullish. they built them up...so well just to stop mid series.

The end result is  black bullet.Right out of the gate you should be hit by awesome. Just pure, musical awesome. The intro sequence was something i continuously looked forward to. The bass is deep and the song is so catchy (I've already downloaded the song). But one can expect a great musical experience outside of just the intro. The combat scenes are backed by a techno/electric beat...that matches the intensity and serious nature of Enju and Rentarou's fights. The subtlety of each piece matches the purpose of the scene so well throughout the 13 episodes.The art is equally good. My biggest compliment i can give it is that it handles battles and fast paced sequences beautifully and is consistent all the way across the board. The world is given a great darkness about it. It really shows just how dire the situation is against the gastrea. The destruction of the city outskirts really shows the impact that the gastrea had physically.The downside of Black Bullet comes most in its story. While it has potential on many fronts, it takes too many and quickly leaves them as an after thought. The strong points come from the representation of the relationship between Rentarou and Enju. It is a moving relationship that continues on a high note throughout the whole season. Rentarou's relationship with cursed children is also highlighted very well. His sympathy and caring nature toward them is pure and loving. He acts out his established morals and wants to unconditionally love these children. The weak point is in the lack of depth in most other sub plots. The relationship that begins to develop between Rentarou and Kisara gets very little screen time and just becomes a tease most of the time. I would have loved to have seen more about the previous tendo battles and the previous gastrea incidents as well as more actions involving the cursed children and the scientists behind the mechanized soldiers/officers.The characters follow the same problems the story does unfortunately. Rentarou, Enju, and Tina quickly became stand outs for me. They had background, story, emotion, and purpose. The cursed children also became quick, emotional stand outs fueled through Enju and Rentarou. The other characters just aren't given enough screen time or background  to become attached to. If they die, it doesn't seem to impact the viewer or characters at all or it is delayed. If they live, you may gain glimpses into them. Kisara was one that had far too much potential to be a great character but was just never given the chance to be (she is still a BA with a sword though).Overall, I'll be returning to Black bullet every so often.

If you can somehow overlook that disgusting fact and make it through the first few episodes, the poor writing becomes terribly apparent. Generously speaking, the exposition is clunky. The majority of information about the world of Black Bullet is conveyed through two characters standing around and telling each other information they both already know for the sake of the audience. It's transparent and lazy writing. Further, events and developments happen without any obvious pre-planning or intention. Characters are saved from situations...and the story progresses through deus ex machina and convenient plot devices, rather than being propelled naturally by the choices characters make or the nature of the world.

Spare yourself from the nauseating contemplation of how a series got away with sexualizing a bunch of ten-year-old girls and what that says about its fanbase."", 'Hi,I saw that some people have done some reviews about this anime and so.. Two things that you must appreciate are the art and the characters of Black Bullet (very well made).Well, the anime story is great, it\'s original and for people who like it\'s rich in fan service.The story is only at the start, and you can understand it ""easily"".FROM NOW I SPOILER SOMETHING TO YOU:As you can read in the plot the story is about some events that interest the (hlf) hume Satomi Rentaro and the ""special girl"" Enju Aihara.The two protagonist in this series try to defeat one/two of the eleven...main enemies.In the case of a second series it will probably be treated a problem about Enju that was revealed in this season.NOW I TELL YOU MY SCORES FOR BLACK BULLETStory: 9 I like it..

Looking at the way it was presented along with its synopsis, I was prepared for some loli harem anime. First, you should know that I prefer watching light-hearted anime rather than dark ones so this review may be a little biased in some way.However a few moments in I was pleasantly surprised.Well, it was truly a mainstream shounen with action and sci-fi (although it's actually a seinen), and it certainly showed signs of being loli harem. But the main character's actions kinda discourage the loli harem aspect, with having another love interest being the...same age and all. At first the balance between actual fights and mental anguish was nice since things like these are good from time to time. However overtime I find it to be excessively overused so much so my evaluations of it changed from 8+ to like, 5 or so.I mean, people kept dying throughout the story (I hope this is not considered to be a spoiler and also there is actually quite a lot of blood in this series so that's kind of expected) and every time the main characters would just break down before reviving back to normal then someone dies and then they break and then they revive. And I just kept wondering where their continuous character development disappeared to when they keep being strong then being weak then being strong then weak. In other words, it was repetitive.Moreover that was a most terrible way to end a series (for me). That anguish and shock (well, more like disappointment) I could feel from that sudden development at the end just totally threw me off. I mean, they just went pass the climax of the series and, normally, the tension should drop here. I mean, it's the end of a series dammit.But no. It went up.Then it just left.I mean, I understand that they could've been trying to build some hype for a second season, but damn it left such a terrible taste behind. I was waiting for some ends for that last arc to be tied up as well. And I got absolutely nothing.Lastly, I could feel the same vibe as Guilty Crown and Code Geass coming from this series. It's just how I feel, but it really feels like the MC's going to go broken sooner or later........ I mean, look at the last 15 minutes of the last episode. I'd say they're all already broken. same age and all. At first the balance between actual fights and mental anguish was nice since things like these are good from time to time.

What happens when the villain\'s actions make more sense than those of the main character ? What happens when the villain is literally the only reason you watch the show ?You start rooting for the villain. And then you get disappointed as the main character, who you really don\'t care about has it his way while the villain doesn\'t.Black Bullet is a prime example of having a main character that is so bland in comparison to the main villain that you wish the villain was the main character.But...first let\'s start with the story. You will probably have understood from the synopsis that this is a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has been reduced to a minimum due to the rise of giant insects, also known as Gastrea. Or rather, I say post-apocalyptic but everything seems fine as everybody is living their peaceful daily lives in town, protected by these black obelisks.The setting is actually pretty confusing and raises multiple questions. It is also riddled with plot holes.First we are explained that humanity barely survived the war against Gastrea. Then we are showed people living in peace. So it\'d be normal to assume that the humans have won the war thus have no reason to live in fear. But no ! Gastrea are still around and some of them are even inside the ""safe"" town, thus why our main character, Satomi Rentarou, exists. His work as a ""Promoter"" is to kill the Gastrea that infest the town... wait. So if it is openly accepted that Gastrea are still roaming around, how come people live their daily lives as usual ? How come the policemen don\'t have black bullets, the only bullets that can injure Gastrea, just like the Promoters ?But whatever. Within minutes after the beginning of the first episodes, we are introduced straight away to the main antagonist - or at least I like to think of him as the main antagonist - of the series: Hiruko Kagetane. A tall, cunning man wearing a magician outfit along with a white mask.Our main character has his little encounter with him and fight from which we learn that Hiruko doesn\'t even need to pay attention to Rentarou to fight him: he literally beats him while being on the phone. Keep that in mind for this is an important point.Later in the series there will be more encounters and fights between Rentarou and Hiruko.One thing that needs to be stated is that not a single time does Rentarou train or upgrades his skills or whatever. From the first to the last episode, he is literally never seen powering up.So this is where my other main issue with the fight scenes happens.*SPOILER AHEAD*During his ""last"" encounter with Hiruko, Rentarou manages to defeat him using his prosthetic limbs that he... was hiding during every other encounter ? This is another major plot hole, as we are told that he had them from the beginning so why did Rentarou get beaten up so often without ever using them ? It\'s not even like there\'s any drawback to use them, did he just forgot to pull out his trump card or something ?*END OF SPOILER*Anyway,  in terms of motives and personality, that the main character is very easily forgettable. He is a ""hero of justice"" you could say and he fights for every single loli he meets (this anime is full of them). He fights for a better world for them, or at least that\'s what he thinks.At this point I feel like it\'s important to state that in the current society, the red-eyed little girls Rentarou fights for are discriminated against due to having Gastrea blood in their veins.Then we learn of Hiruko\'s motives. He wants to create a new war against Gastrea where the red-eyed lolis will be used to defeat them (because the red-eyed lolis have super strength on par with that of a Gastrea). This would accomplish two things: exterminate the Gastrea once and for all and allow society to see the red-eyed girls in a better light as they would be the heroes who defeated the Gastrea. From a logical point of view, it makes sense and this is where I started siding with Hiruko more than Rentarou.Rentarou tries at all costs to stop Hiruko from starting a new war. He tries to protect the very same world that is unfair to the lolis he wants to protect... why ? That does not make any sense. Hiruko states that he and Rentarou are the same and he offers him to join him... but Rentarou has just about no real reason to refuse... yet he does.The moment you understand that, Rentarou starts to look like a huge pushover who has no will of his own and just does things because that\'s what he is ""meant to do"".As you have probably understood by now, the multiple plot-holes in the story (and there are a lot more, trust me) and the lack of identity of the main character are the two down sides of this show.Something that adds to the fact that I rooted more for Hiruko than Rentarou is how Rikiya Koyama is voicing Kagetane. His voice is on point and it really makes the character feel slightly crazy while still gentleman-like.I can\'t say the same about the main character but I\'m not blaming the voice actor. There isn\'t much you can do when your character literally has no personality of his own anyway.The animation was very good, I\'ll have to give the anime that much. The soundtrack wasn\'t exactly amazing but I have to say I found it pretty memorable with fitting OSTs and a beautiful OP from FripSide.Now for the enjoyment... it was very varied. It\'s pretty much 50-50. You could  say I was enjoying myself a lot whenever Hiruko Kagetane was on screen and I was bored the rest of the time.In my opinion, this could have been a very unique and interesting anime if he was the main character of the show.

But hey, at least loli lovers will be happy.', ""Black Bullet was an interesting watch, I will have to say that yes at times it has seemed to have forgotten that it was a post-apocalyptic anime, however, I will note that it is logical (in the anime world that is) to have the Monolith protect the Tokyo area from the Gastera. The animation meets my expectations in the anime and the character designs were really good, really nothing to complain about and nearly something to write home about. As per the story, it honestly was enjoyable enough to actually lure me in and continually watch it for a period of 4 days and I...would say that it is an enjoyable story, although I guess it can be a bit over the place particularly when focusing a lot on the Lady (who I can't remember the name of so I'll just call her lady from now on) seems to forget about the other things going on like the Gastera, in which 2,000 of them are swarming outside the Tokyo Area  and yet the only thing for a span of several episodes that happens is meetings on passing a bill to protect the cursed children and Satomi is responsible for protecting the Lady. Ok, and now it's time for me to ramble about the ending, let's not forget that no one cares about the crumbling Monolith until its too late to build a replacement, WHAT? I mean that seems pretty illogical to me, If this was to occur in the real world there would be several Monoliths encompassing the same area so of one does go down than the area will still be covered. Additionally, even if there was only one, they should have started constructing a replacement when they knew it was going to expire! And then whoops! It expired and crumbled early! I mean this is not that bad of an anime, but I really feel that this ending could be a bit more logical on how Monolith 32 was handled, It's like they needed (well I mean they kind of had to due to how they were setting it up) to make a “humanity is on the brink” action scene before they wrapped up the anime… I mean cmon, this could have been done much, much, MUCH better, and it had the potential too. As for sound, some of the background music was amazing enough to make me look for it on YouTube. This doesn't happen often but my personal favourite soundtrack from this anime is called “Rains of Sorrow” with honourable mentions to “Tokyo Kickin' Back”. Overall this is one of the better animes that I have watched I will have to say that it is one that I would recommend. But seriously that Monolith situation? Pfft, not letting that one slide. would say that it is an enjoyable story, although I guess it can be a bit over the place particularly when focusing a lot on the Lady (who I can't remember the name of so I'll just call her lady from now on) seems to forget about the other things going on like the Gastera, in which 2,000 of them are swarming outside the Tokyo Area  and yet the only thing for a span of several episodes that happens is meetings on passing a bill to protect the cursed children and Satomi is responsible for protecting the Lady.

Many comparing it to Attack on Titan. It was known to be one of the best anime of Spring that year. However, many agree that the ending was disappointing. Making no real sense and contained awful writing. It\'s not just the ending. It\'s the entire show.Story:Black Bullet is an anime where monsters known as Gastrea invade the earth and humanity is left for their own survival. Gastrea infected little ""children"" (I\'ll get to this later) turning them into monsters. And...now it\'s up to our main hero Rentarou to put an end to these creatures along with his sidekick Enju. What\'s good: I like how the Gastrea infect little ""children."" That\'s interesting to see what could happen to these kids. Everything else is done in the most awfully executed way. First off, let\'s talk about how these ""children"" are all little girls. Not a single boy is infected by this. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE LITTLE BOY IN THIS SHOW. ONLY GIRLS. Do you see where I\'m going with this? It\'s loli bait. It\'s done to attract viewers in the most disgusting way. Also, the story is filled with inconsistencies. Like, how they\'re always like ""Oh the outside world is dangerous"" and yet they make these girls go to school because????????? These little girls who were infected by Gastrea and Rentarou forms a bond with them and then ALL OF A SUDDEN they die. What was the point of that? They were never brought up again. The pacing is horrendous. It takes them like 2 minutes to defeat this monster that they say will take a few hours, but nope the anime decided that showing the struggle was too much so time skip. And how our main villain decides to team up with Rentarou because??????????? The ending makes no sense and it leaves you wanting more but guess what? We don\'t get one. The story leaves many things left unexplained, is filled with plot holes and inconsistencies.Art:It\'s decent. Nothing spectacular, but decent. The characters designs are fine, the action scenes when they aren\'t rushed is well animated, the backgrounds are really nice to look at, the CGI is okay, but nothing is done amazingly. It\'s just fine. Nothing is amazing, it\'s just decent.Sound:The voice actors do a fine job portraying their characters, they sound believable. I like how the female voice actors do an excellent job at portraying the little girls voices. It sounds believable. The soundtrack, however, is mediocre. Nothing stands out. The OP and ED are as basic as you can get.Characters:This show comes with a decent amount of characters, but they are all written HORRIBLY. Our lead, Rentarou, is about an interesting as watching grass grow. He doesn\'t develop, he doesn\'t do anything that makes him stand out from the rest of the crowd, he\'s your basic lead. Enju is that fly that keeps swarming around your head that you want to smack but you never can. She\'s a useless, one dimensional character who has a tragic backstory only to hook you into her to find something interesting about her. Kisara is the bland ""Love interest?????"" who does nothing to the show. She is there for the sake of it. Our main villain and his daughter are the bad guys who are behind this whole thing but later decide to join up with Rentarou because. Then we have Rentarou\'s dad who is only there for one episode and is never brought up again. Then we have the girls who are only in there for an episode and are never brought up again. Then we mention Rentarou\'s dead mother only once and is never brought up again. Basically, every character is useless, unlikeable, selfish, bland, etc.Enjoyment:Trash. Utter trash.This anime is nothing more than dog shit. Every character is either bland, stupid, useless, etc. The story is full of inconsistencies and plot holes, the ending is clustered mess, the pacing is awful, the anime is AWFUL. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT. It sucks. If you want a better anime, watch Attack on Titan even as mediocre as it is.

Its sad it wont have a sequel but if your reading this and havent watched the anime then u should consider at least adding it to your planning to watch list cause when the time comes you wont regret it (of course that part is relative). Also wont be Spoiling anything with this comment for people who hate that. This anime has the best of both worlds truly one of the best I´ve watched so far. It has the comedy part and also the serious part as well. The protagonist is not bad and you´ll find similarities to...""Attack on Titan"" both plot wise and Character story. In the comedy part u have some harem aspects to keep it interesting and funny but right after you relax a bit there´s always something serious right around the corner, incomes the serious part that I mentioned, tragedy, action to keep your heart pumpin and tears dropping.NOTE: This anime is not harem but you will notice some aspects that make´s you think that genre is present. Think of it as some comic relieve. ""Attack on Titan"" both plot wise and Character story.

Gastrea is an epidemic, parasitic virus, which form varies from an animal \'til somewhat like dinosaurs or alien. (weird shapes -_-)Civil servants accompanied by ""Cursed Children"", means the children who born with Gastrea virus within body and get superhuman abilities.Well, the story like this is so common, right? You human are in the line of death with no other choice left except to fight those Gastrea. It\'s easy to find the same storyline from other anime series and also the same genres....But the art here is impressed me, The art plus the movements of characters in battles lol.Having touchy-feeling will get you drowned when the dramatic scenes appear. Sometimes the story gets a lil-bit like a drama like when the comrades dead, problematic feelings and hardship as friends. That\'s how I both like and dislike the series, sometimes the dramatic scenes show too contrived.What boost the point of this anime from my point of view are the characters and music themes. The characters varies, so it\'s not boring to get new characters in. For me, the most pleased factors are lolis everywhere. They even fired a gun and so epic as soldiers-born to fight Gastrea. Not to mention the music themes, both OP and ED are damn awesome! Black Bullet ED Tokohana by Nagi Yanagi (トコハナ - やなぎなぎ) and OP song named black bullet by fripSide.

Plus when there are Lolis, its a must watch for me xD. Lets get this out of the way first, I did enjoy this anime, but I felt like there were a lot of things missing.First of all, the first two episodes set up the story quite well, then after the third I felt like the story was over. The antagonist was introduced and the story was set into place then everything was solved and over with. The rest of the anime was a whole other arc of the story. Imagine...the first three episodes as season 1 then 4-13 is Season 2.The whole anime seemed rushed. Probably Black Bullet was planned for 24 episodes or even two seasons but then the budget got slashed so they had to rewrite the story to fit all of the ideas. It is not a bad anime by any stretch. It just feels rushed and certain events that would normally take an episode, takes 3 minutes or even less in some cases.Overall I give this anime a 7/10, I did enjoy Black Bullet but because it was rushed some of the plot elements were not explained quite well or things became SUPER convenient in order to advance the story. the first three episodes as season 1 then 4-13 is Season 2.The whole anime seemed rushed.

The premise is that giant bugs kill everybody in the world, but these bugs carry a disease that turns people into bugs but sometimes little girls get it and get super powers. Then some of these little girls team up with people to fight these giant bugs. The bugs hate this certain metal, so people make weapons out of it and eventually create giant metal obelisks to keep them out. It's a VERY weird premise, but is...presented well for the most part. Unfortunately, the main character is boring, and the little girl he carries around is boring. People show up, but don't really matter. When shocking and sad moments happened to characters, I didn't really care because they were usually just introduced minutes before. The fights that occur are usually pretty cool, but heavily rely on ugly CGI when the bugs are fighting. In summary, Black Bullet had a potentially unique premise, sadly it's wasted on cardboard cutouts for characters and shock violence. If you are looking for a weird and fun to watch anime that requires little effort on your part and you don't mind little girls being blown to smithereens, go ahead and watch it. If not, stay away. presented well for the most part. Unfortunately, the main character is boring, and the little girl he carries around is boring. People show up, but don't really matter.

The theme of, ""humanity is no longer the top of the chain"" became the next biggest thing, and Black Bullet was another one of them. The story about initiators (female pre-Gastrea) and promoters (humans) against Gastrea is great-- except I question why must all initiators be 10 year old girls. The pacing was okay until the end of the series, where something happened out of the blue, and left...the watchers to think, ""wait, what just happened?""Art and Animation: 9The cover art when I first saw this is extremely well done. Contrast in colors while meshing with the dark atmosphere is always great. Animation is fluid and the fights were great to watch. I never got bored while watching these fights. Though, I wished there were more, I guess ""brighter"" colors. Most of the bright color schemes came from the initiators and day-time scenes, when the show is primarily going to be set during the night.Sound: 8FripSide made a great opening, pumping me up for an exciting episode that awaits. The OSTs brings in the suspense and gives off some sort of thriller aspect. The ED slowed the mood down a bit by making it calm, but immediately kicks you back into being pumped. The first few seconds would sometimes intertwine with the last scene of the series before sending it off to the ED credits. As a fan of FripSide, I really enjoyed it.Character: 6Okay, this is where most of my complaints come from. If you\'re not a main character, you can be sure that you will die almost instantly, or just not be noted as much by the main cast.Rentarou, like a lot of main characters, does. not. die. No matter how bad of a situation he is, he will recover from that. With prosthetic limbs, he uses those to his advantage to fight Gastrea. The only problem I have with his character is when he breaks down, because a lot of the times he does, it feels out of place or odd.Enju, the eccentric initiator for Rentarou, who tries to live a normal life, pretending to be a human when she is actually a Gastrea. She is the only character that I can kind of like, but with her personality is odd. She wants to marry her promoter, but she understands that at any point she can become a Gastrea and he will have to kill her.Kisara, a swords-woman that has an obvious crush on Rentarou. Her personality is extremely bossy, but kind and caring. It was obviously thrown out the window in the last episode, making a complete 180 in personality that just did not make any sense. I was confused as to what her motives were, and if it was even necessary.Then you have Kagetane and Kohina, a mysterious duo that seems to be working like a double agent -- they work to fight Gastrea and pick off weak initiators/promoters (as presented in episode 1). They have no real back story, and they had a very long absence before reappearing once more with no explanation as to what happened.Enjoyment and Overall: 7The series in general had a lot of great moments, but it was awkward timing and bad pacing that crippled the series from being something better.

Today, I show that I had high hopes for, Black Bullet.  A show about lolis, infections, varanium, and confusion.Story (5.02/10):  In a post apocalyptic universe, humanity is put on the brink of extinction.  A deadly virus known as the Gastrea virus has taken over the world, infecting the world\'s population, forcing what is left of humanity within these small areas surrounded by walls made of Varanium, a metal with the capability to repel and...destroy these creatures.  The only solution to save the world is through the use of cursed children, small female children that are born with the Gastrea virus inside of them.  It is in this world where our main protagonist Satomi Rentaro, a civil officer, must try and defeat the Gastrea before it\'s too late.Now...to me, the first thing I can think of when it comes to plot idea is Attack on Titan.  Humanity on its last legs, civilizations surrounded by walls that keep the threat out, only one real way to kill their enemy, and the last hope being a combination of human and something else.  Yeah, sounds like attack on titan to me.  When watching this show, I found it to be a strange combination of both Attack on Titan, and Sword art Online.The series in my opinion had a great opening episode.  In the first episode, it explained everything in a timely and orderly manner, essentially giving a proper exposition for everything which I felt was a very good opening to it, as it explained not only characters, but practically every concept that the show has in it.  The show also had a decent amount of comedy and fun moments to it, some of which are actually quite memorable.  However, this alone wasn\'t enough to save the show from its many defective properties.There are many flaws that I find about this series.  For one thing, there seemed to be a lack of cohesion for the series.  The story for the series had a very arc heavy set up where you could clearly see going from episode to episode if you were in one arc or another.  It\'s not bad for any series to do an arc heavy story, but what made it feel awkward was the fact that the series sort of immediately switched to a new story with the next episode, leaving quite a few answers to be yet to be answered.  It felt like SAO in a way, with the first three episodes being quite a well made story, and the rest being somewhat below average in terms of quality.Another thing that felt weird was the fact that the series sort of made a lot of loose ends.  A lot of loose ends.  Every few episodes, there was something that was left unexplained.  Be it an event that was unexplained, an object whose purpose was left untold, or the fate of a character, nothing really felt explained, and there were many gaping plot holes that persisted throughout the series.But above all, one thing was bothering me the most in the entire series.  And that is, where are the Gastrea?  The Gastrea, the antagonists of the series, and the main reason why people are forced to live in these restricted areas, the only reason why the cursed children and civil officers exist, and the reason for basically everything in the series, only really show up as a threat a total of two times in the series.  While the parts about the Gastrea I felt were well executed in terms of how well the story of that particular part was told, most of the series doesn\'t even concern them, and I even forgot about their existence while watching the show.Overall, Black Bullet had a hard time of telling people what it was.  It had both elements of character driven, and plot driven story, which for the most part, just does not work.  Above all, with all of the massive plot holes, lack of a proper antagonist to act as the true enemy of the series, and focusing too much on areas of story that didn\'t feel like it should\'ve gotten as much screen time as it should have, I felt as though black bullet was a complete mess regardless of how great I felt the opening episode was in terms of providing proper exposition.Overview:+  Fantastic opening episode-   Massive, massive plot holes-   Lack of antagonist\'s existence-   Lack of Story cohesionCharacters (5.89/10): For characters, well, we have a mixed bag.  Some characters are quite good, while some are well...terrible.Satomi Rentaro, our main protagonist.  Rentaro has a hatred against the Gastrea.  When he was a kid, his parents were killed in the great Gastrea war and ever since, he has sworn to kill all of the Gastrea.  To me, this sounds like Eren Jaegar.  (They even have the same voice actor)  Rentaro is more or less your average main protagonist in an action anime.  Not only is he obsessed with his goal, he also gets quite reckless and angry.  Aside from having a moral side towards the cursed children, there\'s not really much to him.  The series tries to make Rentaro more than what he is, and it works somewhat well, but for the most part, that\'s his character.  Although, he does use a handgun as a weapon, which fires varanium bullets, aka, Black Bullets.Aihara Enju, a cursed child and the main female protagonist in the series.  Enju is pretty much what you would expect for a 10 year child character.  She has a very endearing and adorable personality, being quite outgoing and happy most of the time.  All the while, having affections towards Rentaro, to the point of self appointing her to be his bride.  As a cursed child, she has immensely increased physical capacity, being a rabbit model initiator.  Basically, that means that she has the ability to kick ass through the use of kicking things in the face.And then, we have Tina Sprout, a cursed child that is an owl model initiator.  Essentially, it means that she has the ability to see far and extremely clear at night.  While she is considered to be a main character, she doesn\'t actually appear in the series until about halfway through the series, she doesn\'t really serve much plot importance, and more or less, is sort of just another character that impacts Rentaro in her own way.Another character I want to mention is Tendo Kisara.  Kisara is more or less the Misaka of the series, though not as perfect and not as badass or willing to give her life to the main protagonist.  In the series, she has faced a situation similar to Rentaro, seeking revenge on the Gastrea that had killed her parents.  For the most part, she\'s a decent character, until the last episode.  In the last episode, she gained this...characteristic, which felt quite odd and sort of uneeded actually.  It was a real dent in her character I felt, and personally, I felt like she shouldn\'t have gotten that one trait at the end.Aside from the characters mentioned above, we have a ton of supporting characters, a great deal of them lacking of really any importance.  What I feel is the biggest flaw in terms of characters is the fact that there are side characters that just show up out of nowhere.  They sort of just insert them into the story and just assume that you\'re ok with it.  Personally, I found this to be quite distracting, as many of the side characters felt more like a distraction or a means to just add in more unnecessary people.Out of the characters, I felt that the actual antagonists of the series were muddled and unclear.  Aside from the Gastrea, we have Kagetane, a character whom I thought was actually a good antagonist.  While he was a decent antagonist, he didn\'t get as much screen time as I thought he would receive, so, as a result, he didn\'t become as detailed as I had hoped.  Apart from these two, we have a bunch of ""antagonists"".  I say that because of the fact that most of them seem quite pointless to see as bad guys, since more or less, they only show up for only one episode, and their evil plot seemed less than extraordinary.  (One example is Yasuwaki Takuto, whom I felt was an absolutely useless character to even put in.)Another thing the series did was wrong I felt, was character deaths.  In this series, several characters perish, all of them supposedly to have significance on our main character.  While I did feel sad about their disappearance from the series, for the most part, since all of them were of characters you barely even get to know or understand, I felt as though they had little to no significance in the overall plot.Overview:+  Decent main characters-   Lack of proper antagonist-   Too many pointless side charactersArt and Sound (7.77/10 and 8.33/10):  While the story and characters were fairly disappointing, the art of the series was quite well made overall.  While it did rely on a moe artstyle, a style that not everyone likes, it did do rather well.  The backgrounds were fairly well detailed, and the characters were well designed.The action scenes were quite well animated and quite well done overall.  The animation was very fluid whenever the action scenes occurred and everything looked very good and helped with the overall show.In terms of music, this show has some very great music.  Black Bullet\'s Opening is addicting and fantastic.  It has a very rock and mysterious feel to it that fits with the show.  It is a very good opening and sounds incredibly well done.  For the show\'s ED, the track is good as well, although, a bit generic feeling.  Overall, the music for this show is fairly well done.  It\'s both memorable and well executed.Overview:+  Good character design+  Memorable musicPersonal enjoyment (6.22/10):  I had high hopes for the show, as did many people.  It was an interesting enough plot that looked like it would create a good show.  At first, I was dazzled, surprised to see how deep the show was by creating an antagonist that played a sort of mind game that made me rethink the entire show\'s setting and ideas that were already put into place as the story began.  But, as time went on, I became more or less saddened by the lack of plot explanation.Black bullet has its problems.  It has a very large amount of plot problems as well as problems with adding in new characters.  Regardless of the problems though, I found Black Bullet to have its perks.  It has a good sense of freelance comedy that comes into play a good deal in the show as well as the fact that the show can be pretty good when it really wants to be.  In the end though, I can\'t really forgive this show for its massive plot holes and its overall flaws.  It wasn\'t a total mess, but Black Bullet did mess up on some things.Overall Score: (6.18/10) destroy these creatures.  The only solution to save the world is through the use of cursed children, small female children that are born with the Gastrea virus inside of them.  It is in this world where our main protagonist Satomi Rentaro, a civil officer, must try and defeat the Gastrea before it\'s too late.Now...to me, the first thing I can think of when it comes to plot idea is Attack on Titan.  Humanity on its last legs, civilizations surrounded by walls that keep the threat out, only one real way to kill their enemy, and the last hope being a combination of human and something else.  Yeah, sounds like attack on titan to me.  When watching this show, I found it to be a strange combination of both Attack on Titan, and Sword art Online.The series in my opinion had a great opening episode.  In the first episode, it explained everything in a timely and orderly manner, essentially giving a proper exposition for everything which I felt was a very good opening to it, as it explained not only characters, but practically every concept that the show has in it.  The show also had a decent amount of comedy and fun moments to it, some of which are actually quite memorable.  However, this alone wasn\'t enough to save the show from its many defective properties.There are many flaws that I find about this series.  For one thing, there seemed to be a lack of cohesion for the series.  The story for the series had a very arc heavy set up where you could clearly see going from episode to episode if you were in one arc or another.  It\'s not bad for any series to do an arc heavy story, but what made it feel awkward was the fact that the series sort of immediately switched to a new story with the next episode, leaving quite a few answers to be yet to be answered.  It felt like SAO in a way, with the first three episodes being quite a well made story, and the rest being somewhat below average in terms of quality.Another thing that felt weird was the fact that the series sort of made a lot of loose ends.  A lot of loose ends.  Every few episodes, there was something that was left unexplained.  Be it an event that was unexplained, an object whose purpose was left untold, or the fate of a character, nothing really felt explained, and there were many gaping plot holes that persisted throughout the series.But above all, one thing was bothering me the most in the entire series.  And that is, where are the Gastrea?  The Gastrea, the antagonists of the series, and the main reason why people are forced to live in these restricted areas, the only reason why the cursed children and civil officers exist, and the reason for basically everything in the series, only really show up as a threat a total of two times in the series.  While the parts about the Gastrea I felt were well executed in terms of how well the story of that particular part was told, most of the series doesn\'t even concern them, and I even forgot about their existence while watching the show.Overall, Black Bullet had a hard time of telling people what it was.  It had both elements of character driven, and plot driven story, which for the most part, just does not work.  Above all, with all of the massive plot holes, lack of a proper antagonist to act as the true enemy of the series, and focusing too much on areas of story that didn\'t feel like it should\'ve gotten as much screen time as it should have, I felt as though black bullet was a complete mess regardless of how great I felt the opening episode was in terms of providing proper exposition.Overview:+  Fantastic opening episode-   Massive, massive plot holes-   Lack of antagonist\'s existence-   Lack of Story cohesionCharacters (5.89/10): For characters, well, we have a mixed bag.  Some characters are quite good, while some are well...terrible.Satomi Rentaro, our main protagonist.  Rentaro has a hatred against the Gastrea.  When he was a kid, his parents were killed in the great Gastrea war and ever since, he has sworn to kill all of the Gastrea.  To me, this sounds like Eren Jaegar.  (They even have the same voice actor)  Rentaro is more or less your average main protagonist in an action anime.  Not only is he obsessed with his goal, he also gets quite reckless and angry.  Aside from having a moral side towards the cursed children, there\'s not really much to him.  The series tries to make Rentaro more than what he is, and it works somewhat well, but for the most part, that\'s his character.  Although, he does use a handgun as a weapon, which fires varanium bullets, aka, Black Bullets.Aihara Enju, a cursed child and the main female protagonist in the series.  Enju is pretty much what you would expect for a 10 year child character.  She has a very endearing and adorable personality, being quite outgoing and happy most of the time.  All the while, having affections towards Rentaro, to the point of self appointing her to be his bride.  As a cursed child, she has immensely increased physical capacity, being a rabbit model initiator.  Basically, that means that she has the ability to kick ass through the use of kicking things in the face.And then, we have Tina Sprout, a cursed child that is an owl model initiator.  Essentially, it means that she has the ability to see far and extremely clear at night.

Sometimes using a portion of wasted neurons is useful when reviewing a series that absolutely has no idea what it’s suppose to be.  Mind you a set protagonist that acts as much righteous as Rush Limbaugh role-playing as King Arthur with the one exception:  Hiruko, who the whole franchise could’ve been about, but let’s be thankful of where we are.If someone told me, “Hey do you like your Guilty Crown and other anime we totally aren’t ripping off, than how about this one.  It’s a story...about a male protagonist who has to fight stuff and you just fell asleep.”  Being generic isn’t so much a bad thing if the writers boldly know how to both create an effective story and interesting characters behind such a ploy.  But let’s go over it.The story goes like this:  Humanity is going to war with a terrible threat meaning humanity is also on the brink of extinction mind you, a hitherto enemy known as Gastrea.  Two Wars with the Gastrea already happened off camera so where.  Also the story takes place in Neo-Tokyo where the residents have walled themselves off with a material called Varanium and constructed Monoliths that ward off the Gastrea.Main character is Satomi Rentaro who is generic teen male fighter and righteous hero of the PEOPLE!  To be honest, most of the characters aren’t really interesting for the most part.  They all take some token presence and bait for the audience to both feel secure and idyllic.  The only character I can ever approve of is Hiruko the foil to Rentaro, who seems to be the only one who’s not brooding serious, or intense serious, or dumb-righteous seriousness (Rentaro what the f**k).  Hiruko could have been the main character of the story because he’s cool without the tone of desperation to be such and such for shallow approval.  And to enlighten on that desperation, I’m going to call it “Simplistic Obligatory Writing”.  It’s when characters for no discernible reasoning become total cocks because they have to.  Now in some cases this makes but in most it just doesn’t.  Sure there’s build up but what to?  What has the character learned from it and why is it in the story?  It’s for the delusion of “Character growth” but in the end it makes no sense and makes the characters unlikable.Now the story is offset at the end when you realize that the show doesn’t know what it’s suppose to be or it’s inconsistent tone.  This is marred by multiple tones ranging from Slice of Life relaxation, to whimsical silliness, to brooding seriousness etc. etc.The anime isn’t so bad that writing this review has taken a few bricks from my load, but that’s like saying the ""Internship"" wasn’t so bad that I got eat some popcorn with it.  You can almost feel the general conflict of the anime, trying to be both fun and dark-seriousness, which is like having it\'s cake and eating it too, leading to being baked in mother\'s \'boiling\' love oven.In the end I’m very tired and feel very awful from this experience, but if you’re the kind that enjoys some nice action, Black Bullet has some of that as well.

I actually enjoyed this a lot more than expected though.Story:6Contrary to some other reviews I've seen around, I found the story was pretty well done if a little dumb. While it did leave a lot of things up to guesswork or otherwise a mystery, there was never really a time where it would have been appropriate to bring the questions back up, nor any reason to do so. For what the characters worked through of the plot elements, it all seemed mostly appropriate, though I would...fault it a bit toward the second-half of the series where it felt a bit rushed.Art/Sound:7For the art, the animations and details were excellent; clothing, hair, weapons, landscape, just everything was well done...except the gore. Any time something or someone was killed, all quality went out the widow in lieu of a gore explosion and almost no definable anatomy.Sound was decent across the board, nothing spectacular, nothing particularly memorable.Characters:5The main character sucked. He was very typical to the 'I will do it for my friends, but I'll do it alone' anime standard, but he did vary a little bit in that he never learned from his stupidity. I'm not saying that love and the power of friendship should ever win the day, just that, if you get your ass kicked whilst alone enough times, you might consider backup. If it were just up to the two main characters, this category would be a 2.However, we have a supporting cast that was amazing. Much out of standard from anime cliches, they really brought the world to life. The first bad guy could be en class with characters like the Joker for how well one could follow his motives. The main (non-loli) girl ended up actually surprising me; usually a character seeking revenge ends up a)feeling bad for the person they were after or b)giving them a slap on the wrist instead because their friend made them soften up. Those and several other characters pretty well displayed a diverse field of characters and views of people in crisis situations.Enjoyment: 6 (personal enjoyment: 8)While I enjoyed this quite a bit, I was looking for something this ridiculous to fill my time, so it was perfect for what I was going for. I think the average person could get a fair amount of enjoyment out of it as well, however. In my opinion this is just as good to watch as any well known action series, possibly better than most. The biggest turn off for me was the unnecessary child death and the loli love crap. The former lost any value it had after the third-ish time and the latter is just dumb.Overall: 6The show probably would have been better received if it had left off after the masked man. Instead, I guess, people felt slighted that they didn't get to know the greater world that was so alluded to but not explored in the anime.I want to note specifically that they do fairly well address the little girls' origins, while some of it is guesswork based on life situations, it doesn't seem too out of place to me. Some spoilers after this point, but it also might make the story easier to understand because this seems to be a large issue with the community...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The story starts 10 years after the attacks that put the world into a state of near ruin. Infected women who were pregnant at the time would give birth to girls only, due to mutation set by the creature's virus. However, they developed along side the infection and basically inherited it in a reduced effect, but with beneficial properties to further alterations. Given that the attacks at the time were (as best I could find) the first attacks, there would have been little data on the infection and the infection has various speeds that it can affect someone based on how it was contracted. While they found out later that it could be spread through bodily fluids, it could easily have been contracted by people just kissing one another or possibly sneezing while infected. The low infection catalyst would have allowed the mother to continue as normal for an unknown time and when they finally had to kill her, it's not that unusual to try to save the child even if the mother is dead. Emergency standard is to save women and children, so having a couple thousand pregnant women being saved is hardly a stretch. Since the newborns exhibited no signs of succumbing to the infection, there would be no reason not to raise them. However, once the realization was made that anyone infected would turn into a monster, it's likely that the protocol became to simply execute them before they turned, which would explain why the girls affected all seem to be around 10 years old; any would-be generations after this would have simply been killed along with the parents when found out and, unable to support the continue influx of infants, they would simply die along with the parentsThen once the girls were older, the government started keeping them around as weapons since they had new knowledge on them and they ended up being tools to combat a greater evil, but as few people wanted them they were basically just tribes of children left in isolation from the normal world. fault it a bit toward the second-half of the series where it felt a bit rushed.Art/Sound:7For the art, the animations and details were excellent; clothing, hair, weapons, landscape, just everything was well done...except the gore.

It starts with an interesting AoT-like apocalypse setting with sci-fi elements, and enjoys good soundtrack and decent production, but turns out to be a mediocre shounen loli-harem-doing-cute-things fan-servicing show that has zero plot progression and expands the range of world too far that not many foreshadowings are actually revealed within the anime.The story starts with our beloved Kaji Yuki VA character that acts cool and cold-blooded. He works a loli partner, who is actually a demi-monster and risks her life in fighting those monsters. So as I was guessing the anime were gonna show the brutality of demi-monsters struggling in...their personalities and not to become a complete monster, the anime introduced more and more high school girls and a female doctor who works in this anime solely to help prepare the materials that the author needed to progress the story.  And then more lolis are introduced, who becomes our beloved MC's harem, and then boom! They fight the final boss and wins.What an unpredictable ride.Story: 2/10The way the story progressed contains no sense at all. Why did that mask guy acts like he was the MC's enemy at first and then suddenly fights that big monster with MC? Why was Seitenshi always caring about MC and allows MC all the rights he wants? Why did Tendou Kisara change her personality? We got ZERO explanation to all those. Instead, we got more screentime for lolis and lolis and explosion scene.Art: 7/10The slice-of-life scenes are done pretty well, not just showing slideshows but has moving characters with detailed emotions. The fight scenes are mediocre though.Sound: 7/10This soundtrack is memorable: https://youtu.be/m9JCveBR-TIOthers are just fine.The OP and ED are good.Character: 3/10I have been expecting deep characterization to Satomi Rentarou since episode 1, as he acts so sad like he has a sad past. But no, they decide to put more 2D lolis into this anime. We got an energetic loli, a silent loli, a smiling loli, and so on.And it is like a joke that Satomi claimed that he likes Tendou, as he seldom shows liking in anyone, including Tendou. Which is annoying.Enjoyment: 5/10Not really enjoying, but since the art is fine, I still completed this series.Overall: FThis anime fails to grab the setting and explores it well.

Instead, we got more screentime for lolis and lolis and explosion scene.Art: 7/10The slice-of-life scenes are done pretty well, not just showing slideshows but has moving characters with detailed emotions. The fight scenes are mediocre though.Sound: 7/10This soundtrack is memorable: https://youtu.be/m9JCveBR-TIOthers are just fine.The OP and ED are good.Character: 3/10I have been expecting deep characterization to Satomi Rentarou since episode 1, as he acts so sad like he has a sad past. But no, they decide to put more 2D lolis into this anime. We got an energetic loli, a silent loli, a smiling loli, and so on.And it is like a joke that Satomi claimed that he likes Tendou, as he seldom shows liking in anyone, including Tendou. Which is annoying.Enjoyment: 5/10Not really enjoying, but since the art is fine, I still completed this series.Overall: FThis anime fails to grab the setting and explores it well. Instead, it just becomes a mediocre loli-killing show that fulfils some's interest."", 'I see how this show earned its 7.5 rating. But at the same time, for as far as this genre goes it deserves a higher rating. Imagine Attack on Titan where they actually explained shit. This review will contain minor spoilers but will not ruin the show for you.Story: Mankind it on its last leg fighting off literally giant ass bugs. However the only two things that can cause harm to them are (1) a rare metal and (2) female children infected with the virus. Hence why it is very much a harem for the MC.Art/Sound: The artwork for this anime is visually stunning....When my friends ask for a good harem, this is in my recommendation. The artwork and sound track is very good considering the type of anime it is.Characters: In 12 episodes, there is only so much character development that can be done. But every character in this show has a role that they successfully fulfill. And you can see them slowly growing over the course of the show but sadly no second season.Enjoyment/Overall: I describe this show as if they explain what the hell happened in Attack on Titan but as a harem and less dramatic. It is a good show, underrated but good none the less. If you enjoyed this show, watch God Eater next. When my friends ask for a good harem, this is in my recommendation.

It felt rushed and had little development throughout the story.Story 5/10- The story didn't flow very well. Events happened that didn't seem to fit the flow, random new injections occurred all the time leaving the viewer to question what they should be paying attention to.Art 7/10- The characters looked fine, however, they didn't have the most detail. Colors were used wisely to fit the mood the creators were trying to get at. But the Gastrea looked really weird and failed to impress to me.Sound 8/10- The soundtrack was done very well.Character 4/10- The characters...were all very predictable and 2 dimensional. But if they weren't following a predictable pattern they were acting in ways that made no sense. Lots of Lolis who wanted MC detracting from me caring about anything else they said. New characters were introduced and given screen time only to play a minimal inconsequential role with no follow up.Enjoyment 5/10- The fight sequences were pretty cool, short but well done. The art and soundtrack were well done. But the story was choppy and left me wondering if anything covered in a certain episode was even important. Characters were poorly done and left me with no emotional attachment to any of them. And the ending was all over the place. It went from predictable, to what Hell is happening?Overall- If you like Loli harem this is the anime for you. were all very predictable and 2 dimensional.

However, it suffers from its blistering pace causing it to miss out on character development and fall flat with its attempts at humor. Your enjoyment hinges on how well you can tolerate its flaws, and while I\'d argue that this anime has more good than bad it does straddle the line quite hard.Review in full:Let\'s start with the good. Black Bullet\'s most frequent quality is its steady (but not overbearing) action scenes. The show does a good job of making action intense and brings out some admirable animation and music...for these scenes. The fights felt varied from each other as a wide variety of battlegrounds, circumstances, and opponents (both human and Gastrea, the antagonist monsters of the show) prevented even repeating rematches from feeling repetitive. There are a few fights that feel like they were cut short to prevent important characters from dying though. Still, solid overall. The other strong point of Black Bullet are its emotional scenes, which are pulled off beautifully thanks to how the show uses its setting.While others have criticized the setting because it doesn\'t convey a sense of imminent human extinction, I would argue that this was never meant to be the case. Humanity clearly suffered a heavy blow in years past, but the discovery and usage of the fictional metal ""Varanium"" is shown to have protected humanity and allowed it to get back on its feet. This is made bluntly clear by the fact that the ""wall"" protecting Tokyo is just an array of Varanium obelisks. Armed with the Gastreas\' kryptonite, it\'s reasonable to believe that the remaining human enclaves (of which there are implied to be many in Japan alone) could exist as futuristic city states similar to Singapore in form and function (which in loose terms is what the setting is).That said, humanity is still fighting the Gastrea, and it turns out that people who are infected with the Gastrea virus before birth (and survive) develop Gastrea-like abilities during their brief lives. This is the point that Black Bullet focuses much of its serious moments on; in a world where the main group fighting humanity\'s enemy are a bunch of child soldiers imbued with the genetic code of that same enemy, what happens when these children are inevitably distrusted & despised for their similarity to the enemy? When they are no longer seen as children but as weapons of war? How does this affect them and their worldview? Is it right, or fair? Black Bullet is just as much about a war between humans and alien-like monsters as it is about main characters Rentaro and Enju as they struggle to find meaningful answers to such questions. This turns what would have been merely a jadedly serious teenage action hero and an energetic young girl into surprisingly appreciable characters and solid main leads.The reason I say ""surprisingly"" is because plot-wise Black Bullet took a lot of shots in rapid succession and not all of them hit (more on that in a bit). Black Bullet\'s touching moments are hits in this regard, and the serious scenes all hit hard. Expect many doses of emotion from this show. Everything is held together by the great soundtrack that feels right at home with the setting, plot, and whatever is currently happening on screen. It\'s even worth checking out on its own. The animation has both good and bad moments, but tends to be good on average. The CG is really hit or miss and is not infrequent.Now for the not-so good. Black Bullet\'s main flaw is that its pacing is simply too fast. While this partially lends to the steady flow of its action it also pushes much of its humor flat on its face, stunts character development, and affects believability by skipping explanations. That\'s really it, but I\'ll go in depth for those wondering exactly what this affects.Anyways, most of the jokes are centered around the loli characters and how Rentaro does a great job of (unintentionally) making a lot of them develop crushes on him. Not all of these jokes are inherently bad but the quick pacing means that these jokes often come shortly after serious scenes. I had to stop and take a breather at a few points when a touching scene was bulldozed by a poorly placed joke just to be forgotten by all characters involved. However, there isn\'t much fanservice outside of these jokes (and these jokes aren\'t frequent either) leaving things balanced to those who can get past them.It does lead to another one of Black Bullet\'s flaws though; character development outside of the main duo is quite low and many backstories are explained in seconds. This isn\'t helped by how oblivious most of them are to the joke scenes. Instead of making you think ""oh, so that scene wasn\'t serious"" they\'ll often make you think ""wow, that character is an idiot"" thanks to this combination. Even worse is the fact that many characters have super-human abilities (a rather common thing in Black Bullet, even outside of the child soldiers) but don\'t so much as have their abilities discussed (with even less having their abilities explained well). It does come off as the sort of thing that is usually left to the viewers to fill in the blanks, but given how often these super-powers are relied on it does tug at the story\'s believability when so little of it is explained.Lastly, the plot is rushed at points (especially during the last arc). Many crucial plot elements are given little to no explanation and there\'s a few lampshades to be had. Sadly, it all falls back to a lack of backstory for most of the characters, as most of these plot elements involve specific side characters that receive far less attention than their importance to the plot warrants. This affects the ending as well since it takes the time to set up for a continuation that seems quite unlikely at this point. At the very least the main plot points are resolved and the final scene is well done.Verdict:Black Bullet might have its problems, and many of them are glaring, but the things it does right are quite great. Its problems keep it from being easily recommendable though. It\'s the sort of show that you watch when you have nothing else planned at the moment, and only because you had a sudden urge to try it out. Then again, pacing is really its biggest issue, so if you can get past that you shouldn\'t have much trouble finding something worthwhile here. for these scenes.

When I first say the preview I thought this post apocalyptic world was going to be  a great setting for an anime. The problem with the anime was it's pacing of the anime it was just awfully done. They throw so much info and story on you in just the couple episodes that you'll be thinking the show is only a 3 episode anime. Then comes the characters. The characters...I thought were awful. You got the generic tsundere anime loli that is in love with the MC. The MC is one of those doesn't look that strong but in reality he is one of the strongest soldiers in the world. Story wise the show had a interesting plot but the problem was everything felt rushed and pushed on the watcher. The ending of the anime made zero sense to me and I tried to pay attention to the show but I still felt the ending was such a waste. I will say I would of enjoyed it a little bit more if it wasn't for the terrible ending. All in all Black Bullet was just another watch once and never talk about it again anime that I will  probably won't watch again. I thought were awful.

In the past decade, we got Spice and Wolf, Baccano, Full metal panic, Haruhi Suzumiya and Toradora. All this series may have some similarities, like most of them taking place at high school, but at the end, they have their own stories. This decade we got more anime based in light novels than manga, and they are all the same. Not all, ok, but most of them are, the same generic fantasy setting, harem story. The formula worked with Sword Art Online, and like eveything it proves to work, it didn't take too...long to start to appear the rip-offs and knock-offs. Black bullet is one of them.¿Male protagonist supposed to be a loser, but end up being a Marty Stu, because he always saves the day? Check.¿Every female character in the show want to be with him, even if some of them are little girls? Check, and yeah, many people find it gross, that's why this show has so bad the reviews. It get more popular for what somepeople called loli fanservice, than the plot. That's not a lolicon, and thak god it doesn't has fanservice scenes with every episode showing little girls' panties, but anyway...japanese people may find cute a little girl who says she loves someone older, western people, not.Just forget about what everybody else talks, and focus and something important tahat nobody said: this show try to made a social criticism, using superpowered kids as a metaphor of oppresion.

It's supposed to be a loser, but he success in everything he does. All the girls in the show are there to be his love interest, even the ones who hasn't reach puberty. Even the villain admire him, and end up fighting by his side.-The harem. Girls who want to be with him. Every girl in this show, even a class of girls Rentaro teach. Enough said. Just the scientist menage to not be there, and even her has her moments.-Characters who are against Rentarou thinks is right that end up two ways: being pathetic villains and dying soon, or joining Rentarou's side, and admiting they were wrong and Rentarou is one of the best ones they've ever met. What a surprise.Also, there are moments so out of character that came from nowhere that you can't believe, specially one in the last episode.So, this is what we got.

The show had felt mediocre and I didn\'t think I would think too highly of it, though the last few episodes end up shining against the rest.For most of the show things felt oddly pointless, characters seemed like they had their own personalities but they still felt a little flat. That is how the entire show felt, flat. Deaths felt like they had no meaning and were just sprinkles on your freezer burned ice cream. It was like the show saw how successful Attack on Titan was and decided...that it was popular due to the deaths. So it introduced a character only to have them die within a few episodes. This formula was persistent through the entire show and it got bland. I did have to chuckle at the end when Rentaro is sobbing on Enju talking about starting to not be fazed by death as the entire show I wasn\'t too fazed. I just sat there going ""Why does it have to be the loli, why does it have to be the loli, why does it have to be the cool guy, why does it have to be the loli."" Though I will say that a few deaths were executed well, but for the most part characters were introduced to be more cannon fodder for your emotions because ""oh my god they killed a kid"".There are plenty of shows which have children dying, I mean Deadman Wonderland starts with a class being slaughtered (wow that totally didn\'t happen in Black Bullet off camera). Black Bullet feels like it see\'s the popularity of other shows and tries to mash it into their show. But this doesn\'t work if you can\'t execute it well. I will say that one thing they executed well was the characters that lost their sanity, they did a good job at portraying people that have seen the gates of Madness and have no care in the world.There were also a few scenes which I genuinely got goosebumps at, mainly some of the scenes where amazing things or amazing shots happened. Like the scene towards the end about the festival that helps them in the battle. I also really enjoyed the scenes where kagetane appeared. He is the top hat guy with the bat shit crazy loli girl that is a mantis type.He is just a fun guy to watch that in a lot of ways I can relate to. He views the world as scummy and wants to rewrite parts of it. He wants to see a new world order and does it looking like a dapper gentleman. I don\'t want to rewrite things, but I am not content with society as it is and would like to change parts of it. Though I have come to accept that you cannot change things by yourself and will condone society temporarily because I am far to lazy to campaign for change. I realize I just slightly contradicted myself but it is simply how my brain works. I can make a change but I don\'t feel like it so I will condone something I see issues in simply because I am lazy. Though Kagetane isn\'t lazy, he acts and he is very good at playing mind games. Another feature I saw is his love to flaunt his power, that is something I enjoy doing when the situation permits it. For the most part I don\'t flaunt such things around because I have no desire for people to see how much I can do; that simply means more publicity and more hassle which I want to avoid for now.Honestly the show doesn\'t have a ton to root for other than its somewhat heart of darkness esque look at things. Heart of Darkness is about thinking you are doing something good when really you are the evil. This was explored from a military point of view in Spec Ops the Line, really recommend the game. But certain characters feel like they come to this realization and other characters feel like they are teetering and don\'t know what is right.I ussually introduce a bunch of characters but really with a show full of people dying why would I, they would just die suddenly because I said ""Hey I like this character"". I will say that other than Kagetane I have two characters I liked a fair amount.Tina SproutA cute loli character that during her ""arc"" she has some very funny scenes and she is someone that has seen death all around her and has come to reconcile with it. She is fine with it all so long as she could carry out her goals, but that changes and she learns to love. She is probably the most mature character on the show and she is like 10. Also she is really cute, has a nice dress, has cool arm things, leggings, a sniper, really good eyesight. I just really like her character, and how cute she is. I love my lolis and this is a girl that made it into my top 10.Sumire MurotoShe is a scientist that has a funny sense of humor. She accuses Rentaro of being a lolicon and nearly convinces Tina that he is amassing a loli harem. It is quite funny to see, she seems to be the only character aware of the show she is in and nearly breaks the fourth wall all the time. Her voice is also nice, it is the voice of someone that has seen it all and is only mildly intrigued by things that others will be exceedingly energetic about yelling, screaming, etc. In most scenes she reminds me of The earl of pudding (Lloyd Asplund) from Code Geass. Though he was a little more energetic especially when his work was threatened. They both remain calm in the face of destruction and death; true Sociopaths.Overall the show was above average when you factor in some good characters and some good scenes and really should be a show you save for a rainy day as there isn\'t much the show accomplishes that isn\'t done much better in other places. Well except if you want harems of loli\'s, then you should go watch Fate/Kalied (ha you thought I would say this show excels in some regard, fucking pleb tier bullshit).Animation: 6 (the show as a whole looked ok, but the Gastrea had really bad CGI for a lot of scenes)Characters: 7 (again the show had some good character but most had less character than the cardboard cutouts of race car drivers at gas stations)Sound: 8 (surprisingly the show did good with the opening, ending and general background songs. Though many songs felt cliche because songs like it are always used to make scenes more badass)Enjoyment: 7 (i felt meh about the show for the most part, with cetain characters bringing a smile to may face, but I wasn\'t loving any characters; except for you Tina, you get a pass)--------------------------Overall: 7 (watch this for your rainy days or loli pleasure if you exhausted other better shows, this will get you to to the next one piece episode most likely) that it was popular due to the deaths.

They both remain calm in the face of destruction and death; true Sociopaths.Overall the show was above average when you factor in some good characters and some good scenes and really should be a show you save for a rainy day as there isn\'t much the show accomplishes that isn\'t done much better in other places. Well except if you want harems of loli\'s, then you should go watch Fate/Kalied (ha you thought I would say this show excels in some regard, fucking pleb tier bullshit).Animation: 6 (the show as a whole looked ok, but the Gastrea had really bad CGI for a lot of scenes)Characters: 7 (again the show had some good character but most had less character than the cardboard cutouts of race car drivers at gas stations)Sound: 8 (surprisingly the show did good with the opening, ending and general background songs. Though many songs felt cliche because songs like it are always used to make scenes more badass)Enjoyment: 7 (i felt meh about the show for the most part, with cetain characters bringing a smile to may face, but I wasn\'t loving any characters; except for you Tina, you get a pass)--------------------------Overall: 7 (watch this for your rainy days or loli pleasure if you exhausted other better shows, this will get you to to the next one piece episode most likely)', ""In the near future world was infected by a virus which transform humans into beasts that kill people.

I hope they never make a sequel.', 'Despite having a setting I am fond of (lolis and scifi), this show has some serious issues. The biggest are broken pacing and inconsistent narrative. As already mentioned in one of the top reviews, the first 4 episodes feel like they could well fill a whole season if directed properly. Instead, because the action progresses so fast, there is no room for any significant reflection moments or character development. On top of the pacing issue there is the narrative problem. The shows jumps from emotional drama to ecchi comedy in a span of minutes. Because of that, the comedy scenes feel unnatural and out of...place, whereas the emotional scenes get unimpactful. So many characters die that the audience stops paying attention to it.Overall, a setting with a lot of potential, sadly wasted by poor directing. place, whereas the emotional scenes get unimpactful.

It takes place in a post apocalyptic future where earth has been overrun by mutated creatures called Gastrea.

Occasionally Gastrea will break through the barrier in which Civil Agents"" are dispatched to defend the population.

It has the same tone as AoT,...lots of action mixed with a decent amount of drama and tragedy.

While it does have a fairly rushed story that moves a fair bit too quickly for my liking and some really dark and bleak moments that are enough to turn off a fair few people, there\'s still a fair amount of enjoyment to be found for those who enjoy post-apocalyptic stories, with some very likable characters, surprisingly good visuals and epic action scenes.Story (6.5/10):Set 10 years after the planet was ravaged by a...devastating epidemic that came to be known as Gastrea, a parasitic virus that turns anyone infected by it into monsters, most humans now reside in the Tokyo Area, a city that\'s protected by metal walls. Even with this protection, however, Gastrea remain a threat to people and so various measures are taken to repel them. There are two ways to defeat the monsters; the first is the titular \'black bullets\', made from a rare metal known as varanium, the same metal that the walls are made out of and only substance that\'s been proven to be effective against Gastrea. The second is the ""Cursed Children"", young girls who were infected by the virus at birth and developed superhuman abilities as a result, but were able to retain their humanity. One such child is Enju Aihara who, along with her partner and surrogate older brother, Rentaro Satomi, is employed by Tendo Civil Security, a company built with the purpose of combatting the threat of Gastrea and is run by Rentaro\'s childhood friend, Kisara Tendo. Soon enough, however, it becomes clear that Gastrea are far from the only threat that Rentaro, Enju and Kisara have to face.Okay, many of you are probably thinking this sounds a lot like ""Attack on Titan"", and trust me, the similarities would be obvious to me even without someone pointing it out. That doesn\'t necessarily have to be a bad thing, though, and there are enough differences to make ""Black Bullet"" its own thing. In some ways, it\'s more similar to zombie thrillers like ""Highschool of the Dead"", particularly in regards to how the Gastrea infect people and turn them into more Gastrea. There\'s a pretty decent amount of world-building, with exactly how the world became the way it is being explained very clearly in the first episode, and political clashes between various authority figures as they struggle to keep the remnants of society from falling apart. And like any zombie thriller worth its salt, we get to see various atrocities committed by humans, to the point where you find yourself wondering who the real monster is.Sadly, none of these things were enough to keep the story from being any better than mediocre. One of the reasons for this is the pacing. The series is 13 episodes long, but it\'s based on content pulled from the first 4 volumes of the light novel series it\'s based on, something that very much does not work in its favour. The series often goes at a really fast pace, with the characters being thrown into all sorts of events that are given next to no build-up beforehand, and the motivations of various characters are left pretty vague since there just isn\'t enough time to explain everything. Also, we learn early on that a lot of people view Cursed Children with contempt due to their connections to the Gastrea, but this discrimination ultimately didn\'t make much sense to me, since regardless of their origins, these girls are one of humanity\'s only hopes against the Gastrea. One could chalk it up to simply people fearing what they don\'t understand, which is sadly common in real life, but I do believe it could have been explored in a little more depth than that. In addition, while the show doesn\'t end in the middle of an arc or anything, it nevertheless does so with pretty much none of the major plot points resolved, and with the novel series having ended prematurely, the chances of ever getting a second season are infinitely close to zero.Art & Animation (8.5/10):""Black Bullet"" is a really good-looking series, which is a surprise given that it was made by two studios that weren\'t all that well-known at the time. From the characters, Gastrea and environments, everything is very well-drawn and detailed and the animations are just fluid enough to be believable. It definitely doesn\'t look flawless; there are a good few rough edges to be found and some effects do look better than others, with the Gastrea transformation being probably the low point as far as effects are concerned, but all in all, the visuals are easily one of the most noteworthy parts of the series, and it deserves credit for nothing if not them.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Black Bullet""\'s music is actually very good, for the most part. It\'s not the most memorable I\'ve ever heard but there are definitely quite a few tracks here that are worth noting, particularly those that play during action scenes. The best parts of the soundtrack, however, have got to be the opening theme ""black bullet"" and the ending theme ""Tokohana"", two very distinct songs that brilliantly capture two separate aspects of the series. The voice acting is very good too, with Luci Christian and Chris Patton easily being the standouts as the leading duo Enju and Rentaro, and Christina Kelly being just behind them as Kisara. As with the music, some performances are better than others, though none of them are what I would call ""poor"".Characters (7.5/10):From the first episode, we can see that Rentaro is a very skilled fighter, as evident by the fact that he manages to earn praise from a villain for the simple fact that he was able to land a strike on him, implying that few, if any, were able to do that before. This skill comes from being trained in combat by Kisara\'s family, who took him in after the death of his parents, as well as being bio-augmented to enhance his strength and speed, making him not a cyborg, but a genetically enhanced human, though to nowhere near the same level as Enju. Personality-wise, he\'s normally a nice guy, but also very pragmatic and realistic, being more than willing to look the other way if he feels it\'s beyond his capacity to help, something Enju calls him out for. While he\'s not an especially interesting or engaging protagonist, he\'s nothing if not likable, and I certainly didn\'t mind the fact that he was on-screen for the majority of the show\'s runtime. His relationship with Enju certainly helps, as he repeatedly shows that he will do anything for her sake and considers her to be family, providing some much-needed heartwarming moments in a show like this.Let\'s be real here, though, the best character in the series has got to be Enju. Yes, she\'s a badass little girl who can use kicks to destroy monsters several times her size, but the best part about her is undoubtedly her kindness. From the first few episodes, we see that she is a very compassionate and forgiving person, showing sympathy for a man who\'s about to transform into a Gastrea and being quick to forgive classmates who turn on her simply for being a Cursed Child, saying she\'ll continue to protect them no matter what. She suffers a lot over the course of the series, which will make you really want to give her a hug on more than one occasion, but throughout all of it she remains strong, cheerful and the single biggest ray of sunshine in a very grim series. People seem to be split on this, with some claiming that her optimistic outlook doesn\'t fit at all with the dystopian wasteland she lives in. However, a similar thing was done with Akane Tsunemori from the cyberpunk crime thriller ""Psycho-Pass"", and she\'s not only my favourite character in that show, but one of my favourite anime characters, period. Similarly, Rei Miyamoto is my favourite character in ""Highschool of the Dead"", for being arguably the only main character who isn\'t an anti-hero. With that in mind, I think it would be pretty hypocritical for me to say that I liked a character like Enju in those shows, but didn\'t like it in this one, especially since while Enju is idealistic, she\'s never preachy about it and has the good sense to know that infected people are beyond saving, even if she doesn\'t like it. Her precocious crush on Rentaro can be annoying, but thankfully it isn\'t focused on too much, with their relationship being framed more as that of an older brother and his younger sister.Next up is Kisara, who is best described as a hybrid of Mikasa Ackerman and Saeko Busujima. For the former, she\'s the black-haired childhood friend and foster sister of the protagonist, with the main difference being that he was adopted into her family instead of her being adopted into his, and for the latter, she\'s a beautiful, highly-skilled swordswoman with a very violent and unstable side, which is especially shown during the last episode, in what is easily one of the most shocking and memorable scenes in the anime. She can be rather harsh towards Rentaro at times, even usually calling him by his last name despite their status as childhood friends, but she still obviously cares for him and does use his first name on occasion, which makes for some very sweet moments. The fourth and final member of the main cast is Tina Sprout, another Cursed Child who is introduced little under halfway through and consequently isn\'t quite as developed as Enju, Rentaro or Kisara, nor does she get as many moments to shine. Without giving too much away, the best way I can describe her would be that she\'s similar to Enju, only not quite as kind and more mature, as well as fighting at long-range with a sniper rifle instead of up close and personal with her feet. Other than the main cast, there are a few other good characters, like the young politician Seitenshi, murderous nihilist Kagetane Ririko and morbid doctor Sumire Moroto, but anything meaningful about them is best left unsaid. Quite a number of characters also end up kicking the bucket over the series, some of which you may end up liking, so you\'d better be careful as to who you get attached to.Enjoyment (7/10):As I\'ve mentioned quite a few times already, ""Black Bullet"" is a very dark and somber series. While there is some humour and fluff to be found, especially when it comes to Enju, Tina and the other Cursed Children, that barely even begins to make up for the sheer bleakness of the show, particularly since much of it involves said children and the various atrocities that are committed against them, and there are quite a few gut-punching scenes that are guaranteed to make you shed a few tears. The action scenes are great and exciting, but with them comes with the frequent death of numerous characters, which may turn off some people completely.Overall:""Black Bullet"" is certainly not without its fair share of problems, mostly in regards to its story, but it\'s still a very likable, entertaining series with a good few memorable moments and just enough originality to make it stand out. There may be a tendency to dismiss it as an ""Attack on Titan"" clone (it isn\'t) and some may be put off solely by the idea of young girls suffering in a horrible, dystopian world.

An anime that shows a black bullet, like once. In the first or second episode. And never again. No more black bullets in Black Bullet.-OverallThe story of Black Bullet is average. It\'s straightforward, which isn\'t necessarily bad. However, something that degrades the score for story is that the main character, like in many action anime, develops this ""immune"" status. The main character, Rentaro, is so ""at the center of the show"" and is so good at fighting, that the audience starts to believe that Rentaro is ""immune"" to the deadly fighting in the show. So, this sort of belief will remove the audience...from the action, since we all know that Rentaro will win in the end. Moving on, the art seems above average. It\'s a lot shinier than other 2014 anime, and it, honestly, looks better than contemporary anime. Can\'t beat No Game No Life\'s art though. Don\'t know if anything can. Ok... getting back on track...The sound is average, but the characters are flat and boring. They all fit into different action-anime-character tropes/archetypes. Their back-stories are unique, but their behavior, as well as beliefs, have all been seen before multiple times. That said, I still enjoyed this anime a good deal, and I\'ll be keeping my eye out for a season 2. Crossing my fingers!Story: 6Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 4Enjoyment: 8Overall: 6.6It\'s fair enough, nearly good. Although in my mind the show deserves a 7. Well, rounded, 6.6 is 7 so...More details down below:-StoryThe story is decent enough. The plot, for the most part, is pretty good and not completely predictable. The action is flashy and looks nice. The fighting is well choreographed, but never too immersive. This is because, over the course of the show, Rentaro develops this ""immortal status"" that, unfortunately, develops for most action-anime protagonists. The ""immortal status"" is when a character wins so many fights, is so good at winning, that we, as the audience, stop believing that this guy can lose. While at times, building the ""immortal status"" is great for plot twists, it doesn\'t really suit a straightforward plot like the one in Black Bullet. Because we know that Rentaro cannot die, the action does lose it\'s luster. But, it\'s not a bad story, and the action is good.-ArtThe visual quality seems somewhat better than contemporary works. It\'s shinier, and the effects look digitally added instead of hand drawn, (which most shows don\'t do anymore anyways) making things like blurred backgrounds look very refined.-SoundThe sound is standard. The opening/ending and the soundtracks are pretty average, and the voices, while not bad, aren\'t amazing either.-CharacterFor the most part, the characters are flat as a piece of paper. They have little dimension. However, it IS an action anime, so I guess it\'s not unexpected. The character\'s back-stories are interesting, but they all act like one archetype or another. Satomi Rentaro is the stereotypical hero. He\'s emotional, stronk, selfless, full of justice, nice, and cheesy as all hell. Enju is... just boring. She doesn\'t really follow an archetype, the closest one she gets to is ""annoying companion."" 49% of the time she opens her mouth, it\'s to declare that she will marry Rentaro or something along those lines. Another 49% of the time she talks, it\'s to ""scare"" off ""competition"" like Kisara. 1% of the time she says something normal and the remaining 1% is when she says something actually serious. The comedy is bland, and funny things just go and ruin the mood of the dark premise. Kisara for most of the series is just ""childhood friend/crush"" and the other characters aren\'t much better. But, this is all normal for an action anime, which focuses more on action than deep characters/story. So I\'ll give character a 4 instead of 3.-EnjoymentDespite all the negative stuff I said in the character section, I still enjoyed this anime. While I laughed my head off because of all the cheesy lines the characters had, the action was entertaining and the show was alright. Although it wasn\'t even close to my two favorites this season, (Woot Isshuukan Friends and No Game No Life all day every day) it was still fun to watch, and hey, it could\'ve been way worse. from the action, since we all know that Rentaro will win in the end. Moving on, the art seems above average. It\'s a lot shinier than other 2014 anime, and it, honestly, looks better than contemporary anime. Can\'t beat No Game No Life\'s art though. Don\'t know if anything can. Ok... getting back on track...The sound is average, but the characters are flat and boring. They all fit into different action-anime-character tropes/archetypes. Their back-stories are unique, but their behavior, as well as beliefs, have all been seen before multiple times. That said, I still enjoyed this anime a good deal, and I\'ll be keeping my eye out for a season 2. Crossing my fingers!Story: 6Art: 8Sound: 7Character: 4Enjoyment: 8Overall: 6.6It\'s fair enough, nearly good. Although in my mind the show deserves a 7. Well, rounded, 6.6 is 7 so...More details down below:-StoryThe story is decent enough. The plot, for the most part, is pretty good and not completely predictable. The action is flashy and looks nice. The fighting is well choreographed, but never too immersive. This is because, over the course of the show, Rentaro develops this ""immortal status"" that, unfortunately, develops for most action-anime protagonists. The ""immortal status"" is when a character wins so many fights, is so good at winning, that we, as the audience, stop believing that this guy can lose. While at times, building the ""immortal status"" is great for plot twists, it doesn\'t really suit a straightforward plot like the one in Black Bullet. Because we know that Rentaro cannot die, the action does lose it\'s luster. But, it\'s not a bad story, and the action is good.-ArtThe visual quality seems somewhat better than contemporary works. It\'s shinier, and the effects look digitally added instead of hand drawn, (which most shows don\'t do anymore anyways) making things like blurred backgrounds look very refined.-SoundThe sound is standard. The opening/ending and the soundtracks are pretty average, and the voices, while not bad, aren\'t amazing either.-CharacterFor the most part, the characters are flat as a piece of paper. They have little dimension. However, it IS an action anime, so I guess it\'s not unexpected. The character\'s back-stories are interesting, but they all act like one archetype or another. Satomi Rentaro is the stereotypical hero. He\'s emotional, stronk, selfless, full of justice, nice, and cheesy as all hell. Enju is... just boring. She doesn\'t really follow an archetype, the closest one she gets to is ""annoying companion."" 49% of the time she opens her mouth, it\'s to declare that she will marry Rentaro or something along those lines. Another 49% of the time she talks, it\'s to ""scare"" off ""competition"" like Kisara. 1% of the time she says something normal and the remaining 1% is when she says something actually serious. The comedy is bland, and funny things just go and ruin the mood of the dark premise. Kisara for most of the series is just ""childhood friend/crush"" and the other characters aren\'t much better. But, this is all normal for an action anime, which focuses more on action than deep characters/story. So I\'ll give character a 4 instead of 3.-EnjoymentDespite all the negative stuff I said in the character section, I still enjoyed this anime. While I laughed my head off because of all the cheesy lines the characters had, the action was entertaining and the show was alright.

Does any of these things ring a bell? No? Ok.Story 4/10:So Black Bullet. The premise of Black Bullet to me seems like they just copied and pasted elements from other shows- cough attack on titan cough blue gender. Basically, there is a virus that turns people into monsters and what’s left of humanity is in a walled off city.So one problem I had with this show right off the bat is the setting it takes place in. The world the story takes...place in paints this epic picture of where humanity is close to extinction and every day is a fight for survival. There is a virus that turns people into monsters that are ""apparently “ beyond human imagination because it seems that giant moths and spiders are apparently beyond human imagination, that kill other people.  Humanity’s only hope is the brave warriors that fight these monsters every day.Now probably judging from what I have said about the world this takes place in, you’re probably thinking to yourself, “why is this a problem for me?”. Well if you have asked yourself that question then I will tell you. Because while watching this show I never saw any actual survival going on. Despite how the monsters are apparently this huge danger to humanity and have killed off most of the human population everything in this world seems to be like our world except for the virus that turns people into monster. What\'s left of the human race is now living in walled off city going about life like nothing ever changed. There are even schools and shops that are open that people go to. You are probably going to argue “well the schools are there to train those you will fight the monsters right?”. Well if you thought that then I am sorry to tell you that you are wrong. They’re just normal schools. Because that\'s what we need in our post-apocalyptic setting… schools. So basically it is just another light novel version of a post apocalypse.Another problem I had with this is show is that it couldn\'t seem to keep a consistent tone going. For example, the tone of this show seems to swing back and forth from dark and edgy, to school life to fan service with little girls- and yes you did read right. Fan service with little girls trying to get on the main character’s D.One thing I did find funny  was this shows attempt to be mature and taken seriously with the whole concept of super loli discrimination. Despite the reason for the super loli discrimination being very forced and seems only to be used for shock factor. It also is used to make the protagonist look like a hero who treats his super lolis with love and respect while the rest of society tries to kill them every chance they get, even though the only reason they are still alive is because they’re super lolis.Wait… so what you’re telling me that these people are pretty much throwing away their only hope of survival? They must be very dumb to do that. I mean assume that these people were actually trying to survive, you would think that they would try and figure out exactly what would help them survive. It is like if an army person were to throw away his gun in the middle of a fire fight.But of course we can\'t have actual good writing; rather, we have to make sure that these little girls are victims and suffer.Now If you’re wondering about the actual storyline and what not, it’s pretty generic and unoriginal. It basically boils down to shit happens and main character has to fix it. And there is some sort of government conspiracy that you don\'t give a fuck about.Characters 3/10:The main character is pretty much a passive bland character that has nothing interesting and the only thing that makes him different from the rest of the character is that he is nice to his lolis and tries to make the world a better place for his super loli harem. Even though he not really trying that hard to do that.The side characters are very bland and nothing interesting about. They are pretty much cardboard cutouts of light novel stereo types. Which aren\'t even that good any way.Art 6/10:Now, for the most part, the animation was fine. But this show had some very bad CG animated scenes. The backgrounds look pretty cool but that was about it.Sound 4/10:The OST for this is very forgetable.  It\'s OP also rip-offs Attack on Titan’s OP, for some reason. The OST was done by Shiro Sagisu who worked on Attack on Titan, Berserk Golden Age movies, and Bleach.Enjoyment 4/10:The only thing I enjoyed about it was the loli discrimination thing. This is like racism to lolis which I found quite funny at times. I am like “oh this is racism towards lolis, I never thought that could happen but it did”. Despite the fact, that the reason for this was very forced and superficial.Overall  4/10:So overall, if you are a loli-con or some kind of pedo then this is the anime for you. However, if you looking for a good post-apocalyptic show then you won\'t find it here. place in paints this epic picture of where humanity is close to extinction and every day is a fight for survival.

Like I could literally only get 4 episodes in cause it was that bad. It's nothing but a fucking magnet for people who are obsessed with lollis, that’s literally this whole show. The story's shitty the characters are random as shit the fucking world these writers throw you into is not explained in the slightest. Let me get into a little detail, cause I actually only watched 4 episodes before I decided it was enough. Bright animation isn't enough to keep me watching. (If I state questions our shit that gets resolved in later episodes my...apologies)StoryIt's some ass. It's so damn cliché oh big monsters took over the world and the bad guy is trying to harvest or use them to take over or destroy the world or whatever and he wants the main guy to help for some unbeknown reason besides oh you interested me. Why the fuck did he interest you, how in gods name could this copy and paste main character from an early 2000's shonen jump anime interest you. The first and second episode are both absolutely pointless they're there to attempt to get you to care for these characters which no one does nor will you ever and to provide as little and as vague as a background for our two mc's so they can throw in what ever the hell they want to later. It's dick butt 2/10CharacterOur main characters are like this, the guy's apparently a like super badass half robot or some shit which we don't find out till episode three or four after he's fought the bad guy two other times already. Like why'd it take you so long to start using your robo limbs man, homies fucking died like he had them in both the fights with this obviously really powerful guy this point just really pissed me off so I'm gonna leave it at that. But robo arm man..robo arm. Now what about the girl well this is a bad example since this show isn't very popular not is it exceptionally good either but if you've ever seen a dark rabbit has seven lives she's essentially haruka. All up on the guys dick, oh blah blah I'm gonna marry you blah blah I love you blah blah shoot me in the woods blah blah surprise kiss blah blah. She's cute don't get me wrong (but the girls in a dark rabbit has seven lifes are way fucking better himea for life dogs). Oh and the one bitch with like clean cut tipped hair or whatever is literally *Insert abusive childhood friend that actually likes MC here*. The bad guy has a mask and reminds me of Pegasus from yugiyo for no reason in particular. The white haired girls super cute. That’s all. Fuck the rest. Actually even fuck these. 1/10AnimationThe fighting is actually pretty sweet. Well the 15 seconds of the fighting is pretty sweet. Cause all the fights are dumb short or not shown. Ending in a bullet or two and maybe even a kick or a punch. The art's kinda nice I guess its what you'd expect of a lot of recent animation bright but like glooming and dark at the same time it's strange if you're up to date with RE you understand what I mean. 6/10OverallAll in all this show is straight dick n balls in a can. The fact it has a 7.5 makes me want to jump infront of a speeding train legs first so my legs break as I get flung into the water below where I'll drown slowly being unable to swim cause of my broken legs. I've tried rewatching it on multiple occasions and each and every time I try to revisit I always forgot why I stopped watching it, then I see the ferst episode and remember. 4 episodes is the farthest I've gotten and the farthest I ever will thank you very much.

I\'m writting this review after few months, so It seems I don\'t remember the story very well, but I will review, what I think.THE STORYAs I mentioned, the story wasn\'t anything oversuperbest, it was casual story, setted in post apo world, which I can say is my fav...setting.

Story is good and bad at same time, although i get impression it is not necessarily because bad source material (although i cant say for sure as well i never read it). I also feel need to point out it is not fair in slightest comparing this to AoT (as it is often compared to it)For one, setting is actually lot more interesting than i originally gave it credit for when i first heard about it years ago. I mean virus bit that turns animals/insects giant and people into...monsters is not particularly new idea in fiction, however i found its implementation into universe be quite fascinating.Then regarding it, the cursed children are whole other subject. Again, overpowered group thats being discriminated is not new idea, but this bit is one area where i say implementation beats most other shows (and coincidentally only bit where i think this show is doing great job). As in this show is not treating discrimination with kid gloves- it goes all out. Although to be fair, it does not shy away from dark side.At its best, Black Bullet can definetly deliver great moments, the joy and heartbreak but at same time most of its good sides are strongly affected if not overshadowed by its bad sides. Biggest issue is its fluidity- it jumps from one section to another, making it sometimes look like loosely connected skits. And sadly- its exact same with lasting impacts. The show doesnt shy away from darkness, as i said, but its shrugged off too quickly. It is cruel world, but its at that point where it breaks any immersion. Its same with impacts characters make. I geniuenly feel if its because source material or just show trying to cram too much into 13 episodes)Also regarding death in Black Bullet- it actually feels forced more times than not, although i do grant that there were few deaths that were set up well.Also lot of plotpoints are teased then never touched upon again, while some things just make illogical jump. Also some important ones are never ever touched upon eitherCharacters tend to be quite interesting though, so at least there is that. Well, aside from, you know, whole ""no lasting consequences"" thing. I do say that male lead is quite all over the place however.I do have to separately point out the weird nature it takes toward cursed children\'s (who are all young kids in anime) relations. You can guess what the nature is. However show at least has enough sense to try and depict that as kids first crush... most of the time. Still, you are better off thinking it like that as hard as it can be.Art:Overall, i say art is quite good- animation can feel bit stiff at times (mostly more idle ones), but artwork and fighting animations tend to be quite good. Wouldnt compare it to say, attack on titan or MHA, but it is very decent.Sound:Music tends to be good to great in Black Bullet (i mean just listen to op!), however voice acting (for the record- i always watch dub if its available).... yeah, one of worse ones ive heard. Sorry.Overall:While black bullet has certainly its strengths, at this point i can only reccommend it as timekiller as plot being all over the place, it indulging in violence to point of having it just for its sake yet it not having lasting impact of any sort, well, these things make it hard to finish.And it is a shame because it had quite few good ideas there. But its very hard to say if it wouldve been better if same 13 episodes wouldve been spread out to 24... Maybe, maybe not.

I guess we never know.', ""Black Bullet is very similar to the amazing anime, Attack On Titan, hell even the openings are almost identical. But where Attack on Titan succeeds Black Bullet falls short of. Black Bullet is a sci-fi, action, and post apocalyptic anime set in the year 2021 where giant monsters known as Gastrea have forced humans to build giant walls made of varanium (Gastrea's weakness) to keep the monsters away. However some Gastrea still find their way into the city, and that's where civil officers come in. They fight the Gastrea and stop them from spreading. Our protagonist Rentarou Satomi is one of the civil officers. Each...officer is also paired with a superhuman female loli called Cursed Children. Cursed Children are the children of women who have trace amounts of Gastrea inside of them. These amounts make the child being born a female, and it gives them special powers. Unfortunately the world hates these children because they believe that the children are gastrea not human. So that's the basic premise, humanity is threatened by monsters, and special teams must keep them at bay. Sounds very similar to AOT, but AOT is able to make the world seem like it's the end, but in BB the world seems fine. They all have electricity, clean streets, and enough resources, giving off the sense that it isn't much of an apocalypse. So the world fails to give off a proper vibe, but are the characters any better? no, not really. Our protagonist is a very cliche character, whose traits are basically that he's a brave badass. Our secondary protagonist, Enju Aihara, is a cursed child working with Rentarou, and she's not any better. All she is, is a cute loli who likes to make boob jokes, and that's where the next problem arises. This show is classified as a sci-fi action anime, but it truly is a comedy harem anime. This show should be dark but it's filled with lame boob jokes that never even got a chuckle out of me. The beginning of the show didn’t have many problems, but as time went on the dark feeling went away, and Rentarou just seemed to gather more lolis for his harem. The beginning also had a very interesting character, whom I found a lot of interest in, but he was killed off after 3 episodes. And 3 episodes is definitely not enough for me to actually care about this character so his death didn't mean much to me, which can be said about basically every character death in this show. None of these characters meant anything to me so none of their deaths did either. The art, animation, and sound design were all very average, and contained nothing special. All in all this show completely fails at what it's trying to be, so if you’re looking for a dark, and action packed anime all you’re gonna find is a loli filled comedy, harem show. officer is also paired with a superhuman female loli called Cursed Children. Cursed Children are the children of women who have trace amounts of Gastrea inside of them. These amounts make the child being born a female, and it gives them special powers. Unfortunately the world hates these children because they believe that the children are gastrea not human. So that's the basic premise, humanity is threatened by monsters, and special teams must keep them at bay. Sounds very similar to AOT, but AOT is able to make the world seem like it's the end, but in BB the world seems fine. They all have electricity, clean streets, and enough resources, giving off the sense that it isn't much of an apocalypse. So the world fails to give off a proper vibe, but are the characters any better? no, not really. Our protagonist is a very cliche character, whose traits are basically that he's a brave badass. Our secondary protagonist, Enju Aihara, is a cursed child working with Rentarou, and she's not any better. All she is, is a cute loli who likes to make boob jokes, and that's where the next problem arises. This show is classified as a sci-fi action anime, but it truly is a comedy harem anime. This show should be dark but it's filled with lame boob jokes that never even got a chuckle out of me. The beginning of the show didn’t have many problems, but as time went on the dark feeling went away, and Rentarou just seemed to gather more lolis for his harem. The beginning also had a very interesting character, whom I found a lot of interest in, but he was killed off after 3 episodes. And 3 episodes is definitely not enough for me to actually care about this character so his death didn't mean much to me, which can be said about basically every character death in this show. None of these characters meant anything to me so none of their deaths did either. The art, animation, and sound design were all very average, and contained nothing special. All in all this show completely fails at what it's trying to be, so if you’re looking for a dark, and action packed anime all you’re gonna find is a loli filled comedy, harem show."", ""This anime was not that good. It seemed way too clichéd and was so insanely predictable as to what would happen next. If you've watched your share of anime, you would almost definitely grimace at the cheesy and predictable plot points that happen.First thing I want to say though, the setting of this anime and background plot had SOOOOO MUCH POTENTIAL. A really good anime could have been made with these two aspects, but unfortunately, it was wasted on such a basic and predictable plot.Story:The story ran around too much, was too uninteresting, and too predictable - like I mentioned before.The main character...didn't really have a goal besides an impossible one. Usually, this is alright for an anime because it's what allows the character to keep going and try to go towards their goal. It's supposed to actually develop the plot. But in this case, all it did was provide the determination for him to face the scenarios. However, in almost all these scenarios his goal seemed like a side objective for him until the section. Throughout this story, the gastrea seemed to be treated like side-characters that were only there for show purposes. He doesn't seem to be trying to work to his goal.Also, the cliches. It was all too much for me. The plot was so damn predictable and cringe-worthy. There was only one part that surprised me and that was when***SPOILER ALERT START***The lolis in the classroom all died because of a terrorist bomb.***SPOILER ALERT END***I especially didn't like the (its a somewhat spoiler so meh) bad guy becomes the good guy cliche.And the part I hate the most: it had so much potential AT THE END TOO DAMN IT. This series ended up wasting a huge amount of potential not just in the beginning but in the end as well! If the series was going to use it's potential the right way with a second season I would definitely have watched, but it isn't bothering to use it at all by not creating a second season at all!!!***SPOILER MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WATCHED READ****What happened to the diagnosis of Enju's corrosion rate!?!?! Wasn't she supposed to die!!!???***END OF SPOIL***Character:I didn't really like the lolis, except for the one with nekomimi, that one was alright... But really though, the characters were also predictable along with the story. Their attitudes were too bright which made me feel sick a bit, although in some cases it was acceptable.Enjoyment & Overall:It's hard to enjoy it because you practically knew what was going to happen next. The plot and characters weren't well made, which wasted all the potential that this series had. I would not recommend this anime, especially to more experienced anime fans. didn't really have a goal besides an impossible one.

And that’s pretty much Black Bullet.As for what it's like: it’s a light novel. Enough said? Its story moves fast, swings big, and is generally not very well told. That said, the story is, if...nothing else, interesting exactly because it is blunt and does not meander much, like many other light novels. It can get pretty angsty, a bit expositiony, and the main character is not much more than a blank cipher for the presumably young, male audience to live vicariously through.

I have never seen nor read its source material before.So you come and see the summary of the anime. you found the summary and the genre quite interesting. Now you might be thinking to yourself whether this anime is worth giving a shot or not? well then, my fellow anime fans, let me help you decide by giving some of my hindsight about this anime.The story starts surprisingly good and interesting, no unecessary dialogue or whatever you want to call it. rentarou a promoter/civil offficer and enju a initiator/curse children, the main character of...this anime. Together they eredicate the gastrea/infected person to protect the citizens of japan.

I like how logical/realistic the main characters think, there\'s no hidden plot armor in terms of strength/power our mc have. The character are all loveable and not annoying except for one side antagonists. The character development is surprisingly good, despite the fact that it\'s moving on an incredible fast pace. Which leads me to discuss the major downfall of the anime, its pacing per arc. The anime is moving on an incredible fast pace, most of the times i felt that the emotions that it want to convey to its viewer is getting nullify due to its pacing. The story felt rushed, like it just want to reached the end. nonetheless i still find this anime enjoyable, I literally watch this anime within the day i started it.Overall: In my honest opinion, the anime is really great. It\'s been so long since I last experience, where in I\'m really excited to click the next episode to see how the story progress. I have seen hundreds of anime already, yet i really think that this is one of the best I\'ve seen so far.

Fuck...this anime. this anime.', 'The problem with Black Bullet is that they don\'t know how to develope a plot, seriously, they present several topics along the 13 episodes but they can\'t just stay with one and develope it, they have to present it and move to the next one.(Spoilers ahead)First example that comes to mind is the issue with the cursed children, they are presented as hated children by the society because the curse etc, they put a lot of enfasis in this but it really doesn\'t go anywhere, it doesn\'t affect MC decisions or Enju decisions, i mean then why so much develope? in fact, i think they...rush to close this in the last EP making the kids appear now somehow """"praying"""" along with the people that hunted and killed them for our heroes to win, i mean what the fuck?Second, Kagetane Hiruko, the guy with the mask, um..what was the point of this character? it is presented as the major antagonist and then it dissapears to come back in the last episodes and he doesn\'t make any different at all in the show, it\'s almost like a joke to the viewer.The same with the doctor, Muroto Sumire, it is presented as something really important, someone who might have a really important role in the next episodes, but it really never happens, her role is the same role as the guy with the mask, just create mistery, the past relation she had with MC it is never really explained but we know something happend, that\'s it.Exactly the same can be said about Kikunojo Tendo and Seitenshi-sama, it is explained who they are and MC develops some realtion with Seitenshi-sama but that\'s it, it doesn\'t go anywhere, she loses relevance in the next episodes and it\'s forgotten even though she is an important person in this world.Also the anime tries to make us cry each time a Loli dies but hey we just meet her in this episode you should at least wait a couple to kill her, besides MC goes extremely emotional about this\'? It really doesn\'t have any sense, furthermore MC starts to understand how cruel was society to the cursed children but he doesn\'t do anything about it, you could think that he goes side to side with the mask guy to destroy Tokyo or something but no, he just doesn\'t do anything at all, neither save them or  anything.And to close this masterpiece we have Kisara Tendo that it is never developed, just presented as a support character that is in love with MC but at the end somehow turns evil by killing a guy who was responsable for the death of her parents, she turns really evil out of nowhere, literally out of nowhere.---Despite all of this im giving it a 5/10 because somehow i managed to enjoy it, was it because of the cute lolis? Was it so bad that it was average? Who knows really but anyway i had to point the terrible flaws this anime has. rush to close this in the last EP making the kids appear now somehow """"praying"""" along with the people that hunted and killed them for our heroes to win, i mean what the fuck?Second, Kagetane Hiruko, the guy with the mask, um..what was the point of this character? it is presented as the major antagonist and then it dissapears to come back in the last episodes and he doesn\'t make any different at all in the show, it\'s almost like a joke to the viewer.The same with the doctor, Muroto Sumire, it is presented as something really important, someone who might have a really important role in the next episodes, but it really never happens, her role is the same role as the guy with the mask, just create mistery, the past relation she had with MC it is never really explained but we know something happend, that\'s it.Exactly the same can be said about Kikunojo Tendo and Seitenshi-sama, it is explained who they are and MC develops some realtion with Seitenshi-sama but that\'s it, it doesn\'t go anywhere, she loses relevance in the next episodes and it\'s forgotten even though she is an important person in this world.Also the anime tries to make us cry each time a Loli dies but hey we just meet her in this episode you should at least wait a couple to kill her, besides MC goes extremely emotional about this\'?

This is a fairly detailed review in which I was VERY careful not to spoil ANYTHING. I admit, a good bit of it is me venting my frustration with the unjust flood of negative reviews for this anime.Having finished Black Bullet a few years after most reviewers, I have had the luxury of being able to read the reviews and reflect upon much of what is said about Black Bullet. I rather liked Black Bullet and hoped for a second season...that said, I find much of the harsh criticism is...unjustified. Having read through several reviews that seem like there was a massive bandwagon in which people expressed their dislike of Black Bullet in the most generic manner as possible...Story - 5I admit that this is the weakest link in the anime. While coherent, it tends to be fairly generic and occasionally has blatant displays of plot armor.  Near the end it felt rushed, but there was nothing a season 2 couldn’t fix. While the plot was nothing special, it wasn’t bad either. It had a more consistent plot than a slew of other anime (Sword Art Online, A Certain Magical Index, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titan...).  Was this the best plot? No, but it’s nothing that ruins the show.Art - 7???No expert in this. Wasn’t anything mortifying. There weren’t any instances of where Art work shined to support the plot (like Madoka Magica or Unlimited Blade Works).Sound - 8I tend to be fairly picky about the music I listen to. That said, I rather enjoy the music from Black Bullet. It’s opening and ending themes are pretty good and I seldom skipped them when watching Black Bullet. My favorite part is easily the theme music.  It has some amazing OST that shines during critical moments. While this was no Guilty Crown or SAO Ordinal Scale, this anime’s sound track is easily a notch above your average anime.Characters - 7-8This is one of the places where Black Bullet gets unusual amounts of hate. There are slews of reviews hating upon the Cursed Children being young girls, but the plot (and basic biology) can explain this... The main character was nothing special, but there were definitely some solid supporting characters. Many of the Cursed Children the audience gets introduced to are decent characters. If we are simply going for character development, even the main character gets more character development than 99% of the characters from Hunter X Hunter....an anime that ‘evidently’ was deserving of a ~9... I do not understand how other reviewers claimed the characters were ‘2-dimensional’ yet had deep and sad back stories. The biggest draw back to this anime in this category is that I wanted MORE character development. This is probably a frustration that other reviewers are having trouble voicing and thus blame the gender, age, or backstory of the characters... These characters are interesting enough to perk the viewers interest and like in Angel Beats, get enough character development for one to crave more, but goes no further, causing an uproar in the audience that other anime that don’t put ANY effort in developing characters (like Raxephon, Hunter X Hunter, seven deadly sins) don’t receive. This anime needed more episodes for this arc and more time devoted to plot and characters. (But nothing a season 2 couldn’t fix).Enjoyment - 9-10I really enjoyed it and want a season 2. This is a solid start to an anime series with an interesting world with cool mechanics.  Most of the complaints about the anime can be explained using 9th grade science knowledge which annoys me. This like other anime gets redundant complaints that the plot ADDRESSED. If I could go into more detail, I would take the time to debunk ~90% of the complaints give (this is not difficult since most of these complaints are repeated and seemingly copy and pasted from one review to the next).Overall - 8I feel this is a high 7 or a low 8. This anime gets more flak than it deserves, but it’s not without short comings.  If you enjoy interesting characters, dark humor, and an interesting world, Black Bullet does a pretty good job at that. I found it ironically enjoyable watching it AFTER reading all the ironious negativity about Black Bullet and puzzling over the complaints (most of which I found to be immartial). The anime is consistent with the ‘rules’ (there are little to no contradictions with the mechanics of the world) it sets and is fairly consistent.This is NOT an anime for those who want something simple that requires no thinking and everything spoon fed to them.  I am frustrated with the anime because there is justification using real world science that it can use to defend itself, but having lasted only 13 episodes, Black Bullet never takes the time to do so...Conclusion: If you enjoy tradgy, philosophy, Darker humor, and cool support characters than Black Bullet is pretty good. If you want mindless action or comedy or utopian worlds then this is not the anime to watch.P.s. Don’t watch this anime (or any anime for that matter) with high expectations.

However, there are some differences. For one, the story is set in the near future, and revolves around more modernized weaponry such as guns with bullets made out of a rare black metal (Hence the title, ""Black Bullet""), private companies commonly referred to as CivSecs (Civilian Security Agencies) that more resemble if the Men in Black were all private mercenaries, and the fact that certain characters are essentially overpowered cyborgs.That being said, the story is actually really...good, despite the show\'s thirteen episode run. It was pretty decent. Not fantastic, but it was certainly better than a bland show such as The Irregular at Magic High School. The ending however, well...it was kind of weak in my opinion. I honestly preferred the ending of the fourth episode more than i did the thirteenth, but I guess that\'s why 13 is considered an unlucky number.In summary, Black Bullet was a halfway good show with great ideas right up until it\'s somewhat weak ending, in my opinion. good, despite the show\'s thirteen episode run.

The characters get developed in interesting directions but you spend so little time on each of them you feel virtually zero connection to any of them by the end of the 13 episodes.I'm going to leave it at that, telling you its terrible and not to watch it because...it's terrible, and say that if the first five minutes of an anime is 1. Fanservice 2. Lolibait and 3. Senseless fast-paced action (this is all three) the anime is probably not going to be very good.I watched this so you don't have to. Please don't watch this.

It isn\'t even explained where the virus came from, how does it exactly work and what I do to the body. The final episode is the worst because there are at least 3 scenes, leaving us with cliffhangers only.Art: 8The art is pretty basic for a show from 2014. Nothing...special.

It also doesn’t even seem to be post apocalyptic.  In part of the first episode it did, and then that’s it it went back to normal world.  While that isn’t a bad thing, I still need to see more of it being post apocalyptic with humanity on the brink of extinction;...they all seem cool with everything.  To me, the art is cool at least.  Nothing special but still I liked it nonetheless.  The tone/story is also all over the place too.  One minute it’s a comedy, the next is a drama and then full on genocide of children and macabre and dark.  The transitions of the tone needs to be a bit better.  Another thing that confused me is why young girls ? I can get behind that pregnant women can get it and it’ll infect the baby inside, but why does it have to be girls that were born ?  Is it just pandering or am I missing something ?Overall I’d give it maybe a 6 out of 10 because while it did have problems, I liked the art style and I did tear up  at some scenes; the soundtrack is also nice too but it’s nothing to write home about or to go crazy over.  The absolute whiplash of tones and emotions didn’t help it either.  Not sure if I’ll watch the second one but who knows they all seem cool with everything.  To me, the art is cool at least.

I enjoyed having the characters discovering different aspects of their humanity. However in the last moments of the final episode they turn Kisara into a ""bad guy"", when it appears she was fully justified and inline with what her stated goals were.Also the one guy throwing the batteries away was stupid. I personally just hate that kind...of stuff. of stuff.', 'Black Bullet is one of those series that had massive potential to be good if only it had an exit strategy. It takes the apocalyptic world-invasion setting of the Shin Megami Tensei and Devill Survivor series, with a decent amount of intrigue surrounding the invading lifeforms and plenty of inter-character drama revolving around how people would deal with the end of the world. However, any time a breakthrough is made regarding the nature of the creatures, the series feels the need to immediately throw it aside with increasingly god-mode baddies. This has the added unfortunate side-effect of the Mary-Sue-ification of the main character as the...series continues. I don\'t know why it is that these series can\'t seem to feel comfortable letting their characters have nice things when they\'ve earned it — they always have to up the ante.Of course, there\'s always a tipping point where both the viewer and the creators seem to acknowledge that the effect of constantly-raising stakes is coming back to bite the series in the ass. The viewer increasingly doubts that the characters are in any real danger, so to counteract this the creators start throwing in massive, poorly thought-out moments that either involve arbitrary character death or character-breaking moments. This behavior often derails a story and leaves the story full of unanswered questions.Unfortunately, Black Bullet\'s final few episodes are jam-packed with these moments, leaving the viewer thinking, ""What on earth is happening anymore?!"" The two main characters start out likable enough, but eventually one of them completely loses any redeeming qualities and goes a bit insane. Meanwhile, the other fully embraces his lolicon tendencies in a very uncomfortable way. This rapid shift away from an otherwise enjoyable story was the unfortunate result of a series that lost sight of its goal somewhere along the way.In fairness, the OP is phenomenal, and the art is often breathtaking. So, if you like spectacle for spectacle\'s sake and can turn off the part of your brain that keeps track of plot points, you\'d probably love this series!

The story\'s premise, set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is threatened by the Gastrea virus, is intriguing and sets the stage for intense action and suspense. Rentaro Satomi\'s character is compelling, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect those around him.However, the anime also delves into darker themes such as discrimination and loss, which can be emotionally taxing. The relationship between Rentaro and Enju, while heartwarming, also highlights the harsh realities of their world and the sacrifices they must make to survive.Visually, ""Black Bullet"" is well-executed,...with beautifully animated action sequences and a detailed post-apocalyptic setting that enhances the overall atmosphere of the anime. The soundtrack complements the tone of the series, adding to its immersive nature.Overall, ""Black Bullet"" is a complex and engaging anime that offers a mix of thrilling action and emotional depth.

You think it sounds bad? Don’t worry, it gets worse!PRODUCTION-WISE, IT'S GOODAnimation and sound is what saves this anime from being complete trash. The voice acting is pretty alright if you can tolerate the protagonist’s constant yelling (it’s the same voice actor as Eren from Attack on Titan, by the way) and the lolis’ high-pitched voices. Music-wise the background music was good and there are even some tracks that are worth...re-listening, such as Crisis Point and Hiruko Kagetane’s theme. The opening and the ending were nice, too. The fight scenes are done pretty well and the 2D animation is smooth and clean. The CGI doesn’t look very good, particularly the huge CGI monsters, but to be fair I’ve seen way worse. The backgrounds and props look good and are very detailed. However, the character designs aren’t great and look either very generic or very incoherent – they don’t really fit the story and the general mood of the series. There are also many times where the characters faces look inconsistent and ugly. But for the most part, it looks very good.AN ATTACK ON TITAN RIP-OFF?In their reviews and comments about this anime, a lot of people have said that it was a rip-off of Attack on Titan, but in my opinion, that is an exaggeration. Granted, there are some significant similarities in the setting: humanity is threatened by horrible creatures and people are living in “safe-zones” protected by a structure (monolith) that keep the creatures away, but that’s about it. Apart from that, they have nothing in common. In fact, this series has more in common with the average zombie apocalypse setting than with the masterpiece that is Attack on Titan.A HAREM SHOW WITH TONS OF LOLISThe worst aspects of this show are the harem elements and the loli bullshit. Most of the female characters, lolis included, are madly in love with the protagonist and will fight to decide who gets to have sexual intercourse with him. As a result, the “comedy” in this anime is about sex, girls talking about their boobs’ size, but especially pedophilia – because pedophilia is cute and funny, apparently!Yep, most of the supposedly comical and cute elements are borderline pedophilia: Enju, the protagonist’s loli partner, can only talk about how much she loves the main character and how she wants to marry him and “make babies” with him (so wholesome!), she calls him her “fiancé”, the protagonist says dumb stuff about her boobs size, Enju and the protagonist live together and sleep in the same bed, there are moments where Enju is half-naked and other moments where the protagonist looks below her skirt (so cute!) and then there’s also the fact that in the first episode, the anime jokes about Enju being covered in “white sticky stuff” (so funny!).If that wasn’t bad enough, there’s also another loli that wants to marry the protagonist and calls him “big brother” (how unexpected!), and they go on a date together because… I don’t know…  it’s not like your very survival is being threatened by a monster virus and you probably have something better to do than going to the mall and buying fancy clothes.THE STORY IS COMPLETE NONSENSEThe job of the protagonist partner is to fight the monsters called Gastreas, but they aren’t soldiers, policemen or even employed by the state. They are “civil officers” who operate in pairs with a loli and work for a private agency and are sometimes called by the police or the government to eliminate Gastreas. Do you realize how stupid that is? They partner with red-eyed lolis with supernatural strength who are the only people capable of fighting the Gastreas. They are supposed to be humanity’s last hope, yet they are private contractors. Shouldn’t these people be under government control? Some of them even do this as a part-time job: the protagonist and his “boss” (a tsundere with big boobs, how original) are high school students, and it is shown that they aren’t remunerated very well, as they are struggling to get enough food. That’s right, the saviors of humanity are poor. How uncharacteristic and funny.The Gastreas can’t be killed by regular weapons, only Varanium rounds can kill them. Varanium rounds are supposed to be expensive, but the protagonist gets them for free from his other female friend with big boobs who works in the weapon industry – how convenient! Why would she give them for free, you might ask? For advertisement, apparently… what a dumb excuse!The character designs seem completely random. Seitenshi, the ruler of the Tokyo area, is clothed like a princess or a British woman from the Victorian era. She also lives in some sort of palace and has an advisor that looks like the stereotype of a Chinese kung fu master. One of the red-eyed lolis wears a huge and impractical dress, when she is supposed to be a sniper and a professional killer. Yes, the story takes place in the future, and fashion and clothing may have evolved. However the background characters and most of the secondary characters are clothed like people of today, so this is incoherent.At some point, the loli with a weird dress that I mentioned earlier is arrested for doing bad stuff – murder of a policeman and assassination attempt on the ruler of the Tokyo area, but they forgive her so that she can join the protagonist’s harem and play the little sister fetish. Hilarious.In one episode, the protagonist, who became the teacher of a classroom of red-eyed lolis (not commenting on that one), decides to go on a field trip, even though Tokyo is on the verge of being annihilated by a huge Gastrea.Then there’s the fact that they never explain why they don’t use weapons of mass destruction against the Gastrea. True, normal bullets can’t kill them, but a nuke or some napalm should do the job.But the thing that makes the less sense in this anime is the systemic racism against the red-eyed lolis. Yeah… That sounds pretty stupid – and it is! The “cursed children” are discriminated against by the vast majority of the people because they are mutant lolis who carry the Gastrea virus and have supernatural strength. In many episodes the anime shows citizens mistreating them and killing them. It is shown several times that it is not just the people who despise them, but also the government and the institutions. The red-eyed lolis live in an abandoned district, separated from the rest of the people. In one episode you see two or three policemen beating and then shooting a red-eyed loli who stole food. This isn’t very believable. That people are scared or suspicious of children with supernatural strength is understandable, but why would the state discriminate them too, when the “cursed children” are the only ones who can defeat the Gastrea and when the government could actually use their supernatural strength to assert their dominance over the masses? This makes no sense.RUSHED PLOTStuff happens way too fast in this anime. Some characters die one or two episodes after being introduced. Then you have Hiruko Kagetane, who is presented as the main antagonist in the first episodes, tries to bring the protagonist to the dark side as early as episode 2, and gets eliminated by him in episode 4, only to reappear towards the end of the series as the protagonist’s ally. The last episodes are even more rushed than the rest of the series: one of the huge Gastrea that is supposed to be very strong and dangerous is killed in a matter of seconds, the protagonist becomes a commander and suddenly turns into an authoritarian tyrant for like 5 minutes and then goes back to normal.THE CHARACTERS ARE EITHER CLICHE OR INCOHERENTThe protagonist is a high school student with a cyborg body made of Varanium, making him pretty overpowered and almost immortal – how convenient for the plot! By the way, why would a 16-year old high school student have such an expensive enhanced body? Good question! Probably because he needs it to hunt monsters with his red-eyed mutant loli “friend”. Right, that makes no sense. This character always gets angry and is constantly yelling for no reason. He also has a weird tendency to yell the name of his attacks which is a bit annoying. Well actually, he isn’t the only one. The antagonist, too, likes to spout nonsense like “Allelujah” or “Gospel” while fighting with the protagonist.As I already said, this show is a harem and most of the female characters just want to have sex with the protagonist for some unknown reason. This automatically makes them bad and predictable characters with overused archetypes such as the tsundere with big boobs, the evil and bloodthirsty loli, and other boring clichés seen hundreds of times in anime. Then you also have Seitenshi, the ruler of the Tokyo area, the “too young too simple, sometimes naive” idealist who is clothed like a princess and somehow ascended to a position of power. How did she managed to do it when she is such a naive and stupid 16- year old girl? Good question! Go ask her advisor who looks like a Kung-fu master. Right, that makes no sense.Then you have the cartoonishly evil characters with distorted and overly evil faces like Seitenshi’s bodyguard, whose only purpose in life is to be super angry at the protagonist, and the ruler of some other area in Japan who is nothing more than your cliché villain that wants the world under his boot.EDGINESSAs I said earlier, towards the end of the series, the protagonist somehow becomes commander of the “civil officers” who must stop an incoming Gastrea invasion, and turns into a dictator, or at least that’s how the anime tries to portray him. In fact, the only authoritarian stuff that he does is shooting the leg of a deserter. But seriously, what kind of armed body allows desertion? Armies don’t, paramilitary groups don’t, mercenaries don’t. Why would the “civil officers” be allowed to desert when Tokyo is about to be destroyed by thousands of giant monsters? In times of war, desertion is punished way more harshly than this. During WW1 the French Army shot at least 918 of its own soldiers for cowardice, and we’re talking about reality here, not a post-apocalyptic world where giant monsters decimated mankind. So the protagonist only did what all commanders would (and should) have done, and I would even say he was pretty kind, as there wasn’t even any execution. Yet the anime tries to portray him as a tyrant, and the protagonist himself thinks he is being a tyrant when acting like this. What does that mean? That the anime tries to make the protagonist cool and edgy, but fails miserably and it ends up as ridiculous.But that’s not the only time they fail at making their characters look cool. The ending actually manages to do worse than this. In the very last scenes of the last episode, a very evil dude is introduced. Very evil dude is Kisara’s (the protagonist’s tsundere boss with big boobs) brother. Very evil dude did very bad things that I will not explain here because the review would be too long. As a consequence, Kisara is very angry at him, and challenges him to a duel. She slashes him with her Japanese sword. Again, the anime tries to portray her as evil and dark, and she acts as if she is evil, even though the man clearly deserved his punishment. But the worst thing in this scene is that Kisara, who until now, acted as the typical tsundere who supports the protagonist and is in love with him, suddenly turns into some sort of crazy woman. There is no explanation as to why her personality changed so suddenly. What does that mean? That the anime tries to be very dark and edgy, but fails miserably and it ends up as hilariously bad. The anime ends on this unexplained personality change and on Kisara’s exaggeratedly evil looking face. A fitting ending for this dumb series.CONCLUSIONAs a conclusion, Black Bullet is yet another dumb harem show with a nonsensical plot and cliché characters. Yet another anime filled with “cute” lolis to appeal to the ped- I mean the “lolicons”. Yet another anime that tries to be dark and violent to impress the teenage anime fans who think that violence means maturity. Yet another light novel adaptation that had too much effort put into the animation and the music when the original story was garbage. re-listening, such as Crisis Point and Hiruko Kagetane’s theme. The opening and the ending were nice, too. The fight scenes are done pretty well and the 2D animation is smooth and clean. The CGI doesn’t look very good, particularly the huge CGI monsters, but to be fair I’ve seen way worse. The backgrounds and props look good and are very detailed.

This makes no sense.RUSHED PLOTStuff happens way too fast in this anime. Some characters die one or two episodes after being introduced. Then you have Hiruko Kagetane, who is presented as the main antagonist in the first episodes, tries to bring the protagonist to the dark side as early as episode 2, and gets eliminated by him in episode 4, only to reappear towards the end of the series as the protagonist’s ally. The last episodes are even more rushed than the rest of the series: one of the huge Gastrea that is supposed to be very strong and dangerous is killed in a matter of seconds, the protagonist becomes a commander and suddenly turns into an authoritarian tyrant for like 5 minutes and then goes back to normal.THE CHARACTERS ARE EITHER CLICHE OR INCOHERENTThe protagonist is a high school student with a cyborg body made of Varanium, making him pretty overpowered and almost immortal – how convenient for the plot! By the way, why would a 16-year old high school student have such an expensive enhanced body? Good question! Probably because he needs it to hunt monsters with his red-eyed mutant loli “friend”. Right, that makes no sense. This character always gets angry and is constantly yelling for no reason. He also has a weird tendency to yell the name of his attacks which is a bit annoying. Well actually, he isn’t the only one. The antagonist, too, likes to spout nonsense like “Allelujah” or “Gospel” while fighting with the protagonist.As I already said, this show is a harem and most of the female characters just want to have sex with the protagonist for some unknown reason. This automatically makes them bad and predictable characters with overused archetypes such as the tsundere with big boobs, the evil and bloodthirsty loli, and other boring clichés seen hundreds of times in anime. Then you also have Seitenshi, the ruler of the Tokyo area, the “too young too simple, sometimes naive” idealist who is clothed like a princess and somehow ascended to a position of power. How did she managed to do it when she is such a naive and stupid 16- year old girl? Good question! Go ask her advisor who looks like a Kung-fu master. Right, that makes no sense.Then you have the cartoonishly evil characters with distorted and overly evil faces like Seitenshi’s bodyguard, whose only purpose in life is to be super angry at the protagonist, and the ruler of some other area in Japan who is nothing more than your cliché villain that wants the world under his boot.EDGINESSAs I said earlier, towards the end of the series, the protagonist somehow becomes commander of the “civil officers” who must stop an incoming Gastrea invasion, and turns into a dictator, or at least that’s how the anime tries to portray him. In fact, the only authoritarian stuff that he does is shooting the leg of a deserter. But seriously, what kind of armed body allows desertion? Armies don’t, paramilitary groups don’t, mercenaries don’t. Why would the “civil officers” be allowed to desert when Tokyo is about to be destroyed by thousands of giant monsters? In times of war, desertion is punished way more harshly than this. During WW1 the French Army shot at least 918 of its own soldiers for cowardice, and we’re talking about reality here, not a post-apocalyptic world where giant monsters decimated mankind. So the protagonist only did what all commanders would (and should) have done, and I would even say he was pretty kind, as there wasn’t even any execution. Yet the anime tries to portray him as a tyrant, and the protagonist himself thinks he is being a tyrant when acting like this. What does that mean? That the anime tries to make the protagonist cool and edgy, but fails miserably and it ends up as ridiculous.But that’s not the only time they fail at making their characters look cool. The ending actually manages to do worse than this. In the very last scenes of the last episode, a very evil dude is introduced. Very evil dude is Kisara’s (the protagonist’s tsundere boss with big boobs) brother. Very evil dude did very bad things that I will not explain here because the review would be too long. As a consequence, Kisara is very angry at him, and challenges him to a duel. She slashes him with her Japanese sword. Again, the anime tries to portray her as evil and dark, and she acts as if she is evil, even though the man clearly deserved his punishment. But the worst thing in this scene is that Kisara, who until now, acted as the typical tsundere who supports the protagonist and is in love with him, suddenly turns into some sort of crazy woman. There is no explanation as to why her personality changed so suddenly. What does that mean? That the anime tries to be very dark and edgy, but fails miserably and it ends up as hilariously bad. The anime ends on this unexplained personality change and on Kisara’s exaggeratedly evil looking face. A fitting ending for this dumb series.CONCLUSIONAs a conclusion, Black Bullet is yet another dumb harem show with a nonsensical plot and cliché characters. Yet another anime filled with “cute” lolis to appeal to the ped- I mean the “lolicons”. Yet another anime that tries to be dark and violent to impress the teenage anime fans who think that violence means maturity. Yet another light novel adaptation that had too much effort put into the animation and the music when the original story was garbage."", ""If you ask me to tell you the names or the plot I wouldn't be much help.

I thought that I could get past all this loli shit to see the bigger picture. Turns out there really wasn't much of one. The story started out strong, then felt like it got rushed at the end. I have no idea why this isn't labeled as a harem on this site because literally EVERY female character had some weird obsession for Satomi. Personally this took away so much potential from the anime seeing as how half of these admirers are like 10 year old girls. Towards the end there were irrelevant...characters brought in, and Kisara had just a shitty change of heart that made no sense at all.Favorite Character: Tina SproutWhile I wasn't a fan of the whole underage girl liking this older guy thing, I did think that when Tina had action she was bad ass. characters brought in, and Kisara had just a shitty change of heart that made no sense at all.Favorite Character: Tina SproutWhile I wasn't a fan of the whole underage girl liking this older guy thing, I did think that when Tina had action she was bad ass."", 'There are only two good things about this anime: ending theme and Kisara. The world that was created by Black Bullet\'s author seemed interesting but in the end i felt that the idea could\'ve been much more exploited. The biggest disappointment in this anime for me was unstable and illogical narration of characters. In single moment one\'s personality was changed by 180 degrees so i couldn\'t find any real connection with any of main characters. Maybe that was purposeful effect to show how ppl will act in world after ""apocalipse"" but it didn\'t feel like it.Only ending theme and Kisara motivated me to watch...untill the end, because she was one shiny star in world full of loli.

So let\'s talk about why it\'s meh.1. The characters had so much potential. They really did. They were all good characters, take or give, I mean some of them were the typical anime cliche, but what can you do. The thing is that, despite being good characters, the development and animating (figuratively speaking) of these characters succkk. It was like watching a show with really bad actors.I don\'t know how to explain it.... Let\'s see. Okay I got it. So the...main character Kentaro.. He does this thing where when he gets upset and emotional, he like pins women to the floor, the wall, railings, ceilings, you name it. But the way he does it, it looks super fake, like an actor portraying a lover\'s role, but hating the actress he\'s working with. And don\'t even get me started on the random emotional  outburst. I swear, i didn\'t think i\'ll ever say that an anime character had ""bad acting"" but kentaro really proved to me there was a first for everything.2. Okay, you know when you\'re going on vacation, and you\'re packing everything you need, but you got lazy with the folding and stuff, so you just throw everything into the suitcase and end up with a curling iron encased in a cocoon of panties? This is basically the show. They have all these elements they wanted to add. but they just loosely tied it together, making a good story a pretty crappy one.  Sometimes, I felt like something was suppose to happen in episode 3, but they forgot so they jammed it into episode 7. It\'s just really unorganized.3. The fights scenes were pretty cool, so that\'s good.4. I\'ll give them the fact that they made me sad, but if you watched a show on killing innocent ten year old girls, I\'m pretty sure you\'ll feel, at the least, bothered. I mean (spoiler alert) they literally bombed 20 girls. legit.5. The ending was pretty cool. I just wish they gave us more time to connect with the characters before they killed them off. I was left feeling awkward, because the music was playing, and kentaro was screaming ""NOOOOO"" all dramatically, but I didn\'t really feel much cause i met him like two episodes ago. Also ONE character developed, and it wasn\'t a total flop. (sort of spoiler) she went all batshit crazy, and turned all evil, and i thought the animator did a pretty good job portraying that the audience. But then the super cool ending was ruined because kentaro got super emotional on a subway, and graced me his superb acting. (seriously, it was awful. you will understand it once you see it. like i know it was suppose to be touching, but ugh. really?)6. the older brother and little sister relationship was cute, and honestly the only reason why i finished this anime.idk man, the thing that disappointed me the most was that this show had so much potential to be a good show, but they went and fcked it up. the animation was good, the drawing, the idea, but they were unorganized about it, and the foundation was weak, resulting in a failed product.p.s. can we talk about how unorganized this review is. I literally have pro and cons all mashed up together, and look at me criticizing their organization LOL. well.

From the fast-paced (in most cases too fast) action scenes, to the heartfelt, altruistic, complex the main character has, it was easy for me to get absorbed into this fantasy world created by Kinema Citrus, and Orange.However, the show really falls flat(er than Enju) on it's face, and really disappointingly so.Story: There's already a synopsis, but basically it's like this:A dude fed up with the corrupt society he was born into (not much of a spoiler, it's apparent right off the bat) attempts to restructure his city inside-out,...by climbing the corporate ladder.

It was key fights ridden with contrived plot devices, to give an immediate resolution to fit within the 13 episode limit.Would I recommend watching? Yes, but with a warning.

In the recommendation page it suggested this one and so I decided to watch it since it was only 13 episodes and just might give me a quick fix.MUSIC:I really liked the opening and closing songs, they each went pretty well with the action and got me pumped up to watch the show. The song from the opening was just about the same song as the one from Attack on Titan (which may explain why I liked it). Overall...though, the opening and closing did fit with the action and and a few good songs throughout the episodes depending on the emotions of the characters so Music in my opinion was great.CHARACTERS:The main character Rentaro was done by the same voice actor as Eren in Attack on Titan. Although I do really like Attack on Titan, I've had some friends tell me they thought he was a little to whiny and cried a lot so when he plays a similar character in another Sci-Fi anime and can't help but agree with him about this voice. Other then him he does manage to get a band of misfits together as the show progresses but you don't get to know to much about the characters in general. Character development is definitely lacking.

In this anime the suspense wasn't really built up and it was quite predictable. As I said before, the characters didn't develop and the story did not really affect that much at all. The premise to the show was interesting, it had a lot of potential but the story needed a bit of work in a few areas to make it go from a 7 to a 9. I did still finish the whole anime so I wouldn't exactly say it wasn't entertaining at all. I wanted action, I got it, the plot was simple but it made sense (for the most part). You won't get to invested in the story, if you had then there would be a second season.ART:Art was one of the strong points in the show, I really like the colours. It was kind of dark and colourful. If there was a bit of other supporting characteristics about the anime to help out then I feel like the art would have been better. Overall the animation was great and I found it pleasing show to watch. though, the opening and closing did fit with the action and and a few good songs throughout the episodes depending on the emotions of the characters so Music in my opinion was great.CHARACTERS:The main character Rentaro was done by the same voice actor as Eren in Attack on Titan. Although I do really like Attack on Titan, I've had some friends tell me they thought he was a little to whiny and cried a lot so when he plays a similar character in another Sci-Fi anime and can't help but agree with him about this voice.

It’s not a terribly unique plot but it’s one that works well. It’s interesting that while there was a danger from the Gastrea, basically a zombiesque invader, they weren’t the real enemy of the series.What I liked:1. The enemy wasn’t as much the Gastrea as other humans. It wouldn’t have been bad for it to have been the Gastrea but it would have been predictable and expected. This made it much more suspenseful and interesting to me.2. Satomi was a complex character with...a mysterious past that was revealed over the course of the series. I loved that he wasn’t afraid to speak his mind or stand up to anyone, regardless of their station.3. I found the rivalry between Kisara and Miori quite amusing.4. Sensei was demented in the best way.5. I found myself loving to hate Hiruko.What I didn’t like:1. Enju is a ten year old girl who keeps hitting on Satomi like she’s 25. It’s made clear in the anime that it’s disturbing but that doesn’t make it any less disturbing.2. As much as I enjoy watching the rivalry battles between Kisara and Miori, it bothers me that a high-schooler (Miori) is openly offering sex to Satomi on a regular basis. I guess I’m getting old.3. Regardless of your opinion of Ayn Rand’s work, she was a she. Making her a male villain is just wrong.4. There’s no logical reason for the Cursed Children to be only females other than to create a bunch of loli fodder.STORY: The synopsis makes this out to be a typical “defeat the invaders” plot when it’s really not about that at all. That’s an overarching theme, yes, but it’s really not the true focus. It’s more of a backdrop. The real enemies are humans -- political enemies, social enemies, peer enemies, familial enemies, unexpected enemies. It’s not just the Gastrea and it’s far more interesting for it. There are quite a number of deep themes touched on in here, more to be conversation starters, I believe, than to give any true answer. What defines social injustice and how should we respond? Does who we or our role in society play a part in how we should respond? Should it play a part? Who has the right to determine who lives and who dies, who’s worthy and who’s not? How does one determine any of that? How should we respond to death? How does war desensitize us to death? So many questions that aren’t really answered because they are almost impossible to answer. But they should be discussed.ART: The art is good. Nothing struck me as amazing but nothing stood out as awful either. It was slightly better than average. There was detail in the hair and clothing of the main characters but not the “extras.” The facial drawing could have been better. The backgrounds were realistic enough and didn’t really add or detract from the scenes. None were memorable. There was a really lovely array of textures -- cement, marble, glass, steel, wood, modern and traditional.CHARACTER: Satomi was the most complex of the characters but given that he’s the main character, that’s the way it should be. His motivations were straight-forward and remained consistent. He’s a Protector personality but he didn’t always succeed and that added suspense and realism and angst, and I loved it. He was often snarky and sarcastic, a fabulous combination. He struggled with his emotions in a variety of ways and was a well-rounded character who went through several mini-growth arcs. Stellar character writing, in my opinion. The other characters were nowhere near as complex but they weren’t shallow either. They each had their own distinct motivations and goals and acted accordingly. Enju had a small growth arc, as did Tina, and many of the Cursed Children showed their humanity in a variety of ways.SOUND: The sound was okay. I rarely noticed it one way or the other. A couple times, I felt the background music wasn’t suitable but it was short-lived. I didn’t particularly like the first opening or ending theme but the second set, I liked better.OVERALL: I enjoyed it. It kept my attention and while it never elicited a strong emotional response from me, despite many emotional moments, I did like the questions it posed in my mind. I liked that, in reality, they weren’t fighting the Gastrea as much as each other and oftentimes, used the Gastrea as an excuse for what otherwise would have been inexcusable. I recommend it and feel it’s best watched as a marathon or in chunks of four episodes for cohesiveness. a mysterious past that was revealed over the course of the series.

The concept is similar, but the anime itself is VERY different. Let's get to it:*Story*It's good. I like the idea of having these troubled children that evolved to allow them to better combat the threat of having to live outside the walls, and then having these children trained for combat alongside a partnet. It's a good concept and it makes for a good anime. I found the story quite satysfying, although it's nothing special.*Art*The anime looks really good, and has some really nice action scenes. The girls are...cute and the protag looks cool. Not much more to say.*Character*This is kind of where the anime dies for me. I REALLY hate the whole lolicon theme going on, and the whole little girl coming on to the protag thing is a big turn-off. Most of the characters are also really bland, especially the girls who are all generic moe lolis.*Enjoyment*I think I would have enjoyed this anime a lot more had the fun not been constantly interrupted with borderline pedophillic garbage constantly ripping me out of the immersion. I couldn't get into a good spree because I'd constantly have to skip or painfully suffer through lolicon romance.Aside from that though I enjoyed it very much.Black Bullet is a good anime that suffers from annoying lolicon fanservice and poor character arcs. The action is good and the premise is really interesting, and if you can ignore the annoying loli harem garbage, I think you will enjoy this anime quite a lot actually. cute and the protag looks cool.

I decided to try it again and, while I admit it wasn\'t as awful as I was expecting, it still had areas I was left disappointed in.Story: Black Bullet\'s story was initially enticing for me to give it a try.  A brand new disease known as the Gastrea virus ravages through much of Japan.  This causes it\'s citizens to transform into monsters, usually in the form of a ferocious looking insect.  They attack humans endlessly...and don\'t let up.  In order to counter this, Japan employs female children, dubbed by some as the ""Cursed"" ones.  They are assigned with a partner, known as a promoter, and as an initiator, they fight in teams of two to eradicate Japan from these monsters that pop up.  In an effort to save Tokyo, giant walls made of Varanium, a special metal disliked by the Gastrea, are created.  The mix of all of these show what Japan needs to do in order to keep their citizens safe, as these creatures are feared by all.If this storyline reminds you of something you\'ve seen before, then you probably aren\'t the first.  This is basically a mix of Claymore, Attack on Titan and Cagaster of an Insect Cage.  This in itself isn\'t a bad thing because all three of these series had some really strong elements in them.  Black Bullet actually does a decent job explaining why they need to use the cursed children and the risks associated with it.  They also take ample time showing us the hardship they go through because the public doesn\'t see them all in the same light that the promoters do.  They also treat death among certain members pretty appropriately, and it\'s pretty eye opening when our characters react to that.  There were some solid storylines that I\'m glad we got to watch.The problem is when you have too much of a good thing.  They ""really"" wanted to push action sequences between non-Gastrea, and I\'m not entirely sure why.  It\'s done well at points.  But not well enough to make more than half the series about it.  Some of the smaller confrontations between humans legitimately made sense, but aren\'t we watching this series to see how our cast attempts to save humanity?  There just wasn\'t enough of that.  There also wasn\'t enough talk, or even action, on how our crew was going to thwart off the threat, on any kind of scale.  That\'s really disappointing.  More inexcusable is the ending.  One of our characters seems to have this pent up feeling of revenge that they\'ve been hiding, and roughly half of the final episode give us that ""storyline"".  It\'s just kind of randomly added and it\'s not even that enticing.  My guess is that\'s goal is to feed us into another season, but this wouldn\'t make me watch more.  (5/10)Characters: Rentarou Satomi is our main character, a promoter, and he\'s actually a lot smarter than we\'re led on to believe.  He has simple tactics and doesn\'t try and brute force anything.  He has a bit of a damaged past that somewhat keeps him motivated through the entire Gastrea war, and he\'s a man of very strong ideals, especially regarding his partner, Enju Aihara.  She is a very sweet girl who clearly wants to live like a normal ten year old, while being by Rentarou\'s side at pretty much all times.  She displays real emotion at key moments during the plotlines that revolve around other cursed children.  You really feel for them all.Side characters are mostly decent because of the backstories that the series uses to support them.  Sumire is a researcher who has a bit of a strange personality, but I weirdly liked her inclusion.  She\'s just so different than any other character in our cast.  Kisara Tendou is our sword-wielding president of the security agency that she manages.  She wants to see the Gastrea defeated and seeks to use whatever powers she has to see them slain.  Kagetani is possibly the most confusing character here.  He has an early interaction with both Rentarou and the local authorities that make you question who he is, but the path between that and the ending left me terribly confused about both his goals, and what his origins were.  They just kind of felt like they were included for the sake of having an awkward antagonist.  As we meet more and more characters in the series, we are given small snippets of information that tell you about their character, but he\'s mostly left out of that, which is strange to me, considering what he can do.  (7/10)Art: Black Bullet actually looks pretty good.  Action sequences are easy to follow and they all have a certain polish to them that make them appealing to watch.  The problem?  The series leaves out a lot of sequences where there could have been action, and they decide to tell us about what happened, rather than show us.  One example is when Enju is attacked by another cursed child and we are left to... believe what happened?  I really hate when series, especially action series, do this and it really leaves out something that could awe your audience.  (8/10)Sound: As far as sound goes, Black Bullet is pretty solid.  The OST had some really fun tracks.   Tokohana, the ED by Nagi Yanagi, is a solid song, while she also sang two different versions of another song, Wasurenai Tame Ni.  I really don\'t understand people\'s love for fripSide.  Their songs sound the same and even though the OP, black bullet, is an okay song, it sounds like their other works.  The voice cast here is extremely strong.  Luci Christian (Enju) is not the person I was expecting to be cast here, but she does a phenomenal job here.  Chris Patton (Rentarou) also puts in a very strong performance here.  Christina Kelly (Kisara) wasn\'t someone I expected a whole lot out of, mainly because of her work with 3D Real Girl, but she was really good here.  The cast up and down the lineup were really well done, credit to the ADR Director (Christopher Ayres).  On that note, this might be the first anime in a while to include so much swearing.  And while I don\'t love swearing, it worked out fine here.  Rarely do you hear swearing in anime series, but Rentarou and a few other cast members seem to use it sparingly here.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: Black Bullet\'s ultimate undoing was their lack of tackling the Gastrea, having questionable execution on certain plot points, such as leaving out scenes where the strong animation could be utilized.  There was so much potential, but it felt like there wasn\'t a clear direction on where this series wanted to go.  Add the poor ending, and I really don\'t recommend this to any certain audience.  It treats its characters well, while also including compelling character stories, but that\'s likely not the audience this kind of series would be targeting.  (6/10) and don\'t let up.

(6/10)', ""Right off the bat, let me say that I did not finish watching this anime for reasons I will get into. This anime has been sitting on my watchlist for literal years, so I decided to give it a shot. I mean, it comes from a year that I was binging anime like this and I am not surprised that I put it in my watch later list. It has all the elements that I like, it just fails miserably on execution. There is blood, gore, action, mystery, a good plot premise, and decent character setups. To top that off, Black Bullet even has a...good bit of lore behind it and somewhat of a sci-fi element.The problem is that nothing goes together with one another. This anime's failure is ultimately due to the insane pacing and the way everything is just crammed in or forgotten. The plot here moves so fast that subplots just fall out. This is a 13-episode anime and by episode four, the episode that made me give up on it, I had to put it down. That episode's pace was light-speed and felt like a final episode by the end of it. Which is really unfortunate, because I like a good part of what was presented initially. There is just no time given to anything. Not the character's backstory, not the supporting cast, not the villain, and definitely not the abilities that are presented.Look, I don't hate this anime, but I wrote this as a warning to those who are looking at that high rating and thinking that this might be a good anime to pick up. It is not. Attack on Titan did the whole setup way better than this.

However, the anime progression loses steam around episode 4 or 5, and some of those subplots are never fully explained in the end.For all the lack of development on the other subplots, one might think that it is due to the short series of the anime,...but in reality there was just too much distractions: there were two episodes where the anime did not progressed and trivial banter was included.The lack of a proper structure for the anime, combined with a lack of a cohesive story ultimately make this anime fall short of being what it could have been, a dystopian anime with elements of mystery, action, comedy and harem packed nicely into one. but in reality there was just too much distractions: there were two episodes where the anime did not progressed and trivial banter was included.The lack of a proper structure for the anime, combined with a lack of a cohesive story ultimately make this anime fall short of being what it could have been, a dystopian anime with elements of mystery, action, comedy and harem packed nicely into one.', ""Story:People started turning into giant monsters.

(also if you ever want to rewatch any part of this anime the twist at the end is great)"", 'The following is an excerpt from the deep dive project:Black BulletCompletedUnknown completion date, probably summer 2014Not RecommendedWhat do you get when you combine extreme light novel edginess with mutant lolis and kaiju bugs? One of my first favorite anime, which is also the trope-ridden edgefest that is Black Bullet. I actually recommended this show in some of my early reviews. Hopefully I edited that part out later.Black Bullet is basically my SAO. In other words, a not-very-good anime that I loved anyways due to inexperience. This show really speaks to my extreme tastes in...television. BB has a lot of classic anime tropes: delicacies such as the edgy protagonist and the tsundere main girl. You can’t talk about this show without bringing up the loli massacres and brutalizations, and the straight-up body horror present in this show. Also involving lolis. If anyone ever wants to argue that I’m an edgelord and a lolicon, this would be their earliest evidence.Allow me to spell it out for you; Black Bullet is a loli-ridden edgefest. There is lots of violence, gore and gritty tragedy throughout. Tons of lolis are harmed throughout the show, which is thoroughly saddening and edgy. Most main plot points are just slathered in blood and edge.In the same way that I can argue that this show is great because it has a loli that wields a fifty-cal or a protagonist who possesses some cool, uh, features, it is just as easy to point out the clichéd and trope-ridden amalgamation that is Black Bullet. If the light novel was a western novel series then emo kids would have spent weeks discussing how deep and meaningful the themes were and how their depression reached new lows.Briefly defending my position here, this anime is at best a 6/10 for me now, obviously. Despite all the edge, BB has one of the best color palettes I have seen to date. It’s got a subdued, slightly moody take on the vibrance often present in modern anime. I love the artstyle in general, so needless to say I quite like Kinema Citrus as a studio. Could just be rose-tinted glasses, but I also recall the animation being excellent for most action scenes in the show.Yeah, there’s no recommending Black Bullet to anyone, no matter how much I want to. If I say ‘edge’ anymore I am going to get blacklisted, so due to the extremely violent, loli-destroying nature of the show I do not recommend that you or anyone you know watches any of it. It emotionally devastated a friend of mine; it’ll probably do the same to you.In terms of alternative grimdark anime series you should watch, my first recommendation goes to Darker than Black, an off the rails sci-fi action show with weird world building that makes no sense but is enjoyable nonetheless. For seconds, you are welcome to try out Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, a dark fantasy show that I have been kind-of championing for some time now. The show’s not perfect and there is some teenage dialogue from some teenage kids, but if that doesn’t phase you it’ll probably be a good watch. And for dessert you can go watch the three Berserk: Golden Age Arc movies on netflix. They’re 3D but look good for the most part, and daaaamn do most of the major scenes hit hard. The dub was also excellent. Just be warned that anything Berserk is extremely hardcore; not for squimish viewers.(Whew, I finished it. That one took awhile. Also took like five editing passes.) television. BB has a lot of classic anime tropes: delicacies such as the edgy protagonist and the tsundere main girl.

It is sad to see an Anime with no real Story behind it, or lets say to have a proper storyline itself.Imo, the flaws are not: Loli Harem, Bad Animation, Bad implementation.The flaws are: Story Telling and specifically Characters.Im going to make it short because i want to sleep.First things of, the Story. It had no impact in itself and was not really are masterpiece in its telling. We had fragments put together to make it one story until you could get it into the end to make it a...whole. Yet the fragments were either to big or it didnt fit in. Those were made to fit, which is sad. Some episodes of these, some episodes of that and the main focus in its telling is... it hasnt one. Predictability shouldnt be mentioned. People who read crime novels are practically reading the same, just with different patterns, so you cant use it as an argument for the story. The plot line was just weird, as you could follow it step by step but had full clue where it ended. There was nothing you wanted either to happen or to not happen. It was just there thrown in and you should be fine with it somehow. 5/10Sound was nice and good to hear but a little bit standart in some scenes. 8/10The Art was not the worst. Sometimes it had some very nice elements of animation. Though it didnt really made you tear from your stool. 7/10While getting in to find a good feeling for the characters, the anime was either too short, or as you can tell from above it didnt give out much for the watchers. Experiencing the pain of a child is always heavy to watch. Being lonely is one of the worst things that could happen to children but having someone watching over you feels heartwarming. The girls was standardly cute but also very dangerous. The side characters though didnt give me something to make me feel related nor should I be liking them somehow. Main Problem here is that you have too less time to give them a place in your heart. The side characters who fought with the MC were not really involving, in the way of his life because it was too fixated to MC\'s goals and MC\'s problem yet we have to kinda get used to them somehow. I wanted to know more about the professor for example, the children, MC\'s waifus etc. But they kinda were just there to begin with and MC worked for one of them.Spoilers ahead:It also felt very forced to make Kisara Tendo being the villain after MC had to deal with the first villain and getting beaten up by Ayn Rand\'s little girl who then allies with MC who has been threaten by Ayn Rand to make us feels sorry somehow. They gave the ""feel-sorry-for-them"" factor waaay too much priority just because it was post-apocalyptic and people were way to paranoid. I still liked the MC and i shipped him with Kisara, even though it was not meant to be and MC was kinda edgy. 5/10Overall: It wasnt a bad anime but with much more time in thinking about what should be let in or how much of something should be put in would be a very good idea to make future Anime like these great and enjoyable for all. It sometimes felt underwhelming to watch and i had to give it a shot after half a year. Good to make this experience though. 6/10But still as a side note; we can somehow learn from this Anime. Racism is a thing in it and MC tries (or atleast he tried somehow by beating up the bad guys) to give them a place in the world. The girls were different and they never stood a chance to get a life of a normal born Person. They were excluded from the main town, got killed etc. just because the bloodline differed the humane. In real life, we should never judge people just by their appeareance. Always judge them from their personality because the skin color still does not show the personality. (even though a lot of people still fishing for it. but then again, we still shouldnt put everyone from one race in a box just because there are negative examples from them. Look at Obama and Trump. Two different people with different intentions and guess what skincolor they have.) whole. Yet the fragments were either to big or it didnt fit in. Those were made to fit, which is sad.

The plot is nothing special from many of the generic animes that come and go each season. It comes with characters that are very typical as well. For example, the common younger girl who likes the MC and stuff. I find it kinda whatever and since it's not a huge thing in the show, I don't mind it. The MC's personality is better than most shows since he acts more mature but he still lets his emotions control his words/actions sometimes. NOTE: There is a lot of clichesOverall, this is a nice watch if you are looking for something that...isn't terrible. However, this show is not a must-watch show.

I want to see something NEW and exciting! Something original. Black Bullet was not original. The typical Post Apocalyptic setting and having your parents brutally killed. Etc. The story was rushed. One thing I hate are anime's with only 13 episodes yet they're not executed properly. If you know the story is too long for 13 episodes do not try to squeeze it in...because it only ends up rushed in the ending. An example of this is Charlotte which I wouldn't recommend anyone going to watch.Art:5/10Some may say I'm so evillllll. Why would you give Black Bullet's art 5/10?!!Why do you ask??Because of Kisara's hair.This girl looked like she had straw on her hair it was ugly, very ugly. In addition to this Rentaro's body?? Why is his waist smaller than mine?? For this I had to mark the art down.

The show starts as an action show (with a little of Equilibrium (the awesome movie from 2002) vibe, then it tries, not very competently, to be a political thriller for about 2 episodes, then it switches to comedy mixed with a horrendous romcom, only to end as an action show. All in just 13 episodes. Yes, it is...exactly as bad as it sounds.The show follows the exploits of one Rentarou Satomi - a type of security agent who fights Gastrea - type of parasitic monsters, and his 10 year old (yes, it’s that bad) super-human partner - Enju Aihara. Together they fight monsters, act as bodyguards, save the last remnant of humanity and still have time to act like morons. Seriously. At least 50% of the shit they get into could be avoided if at least one of them had a functioning brain. But I guess intelligence and competence isn’t something that was in the cards for them.Let’s stop for a moment and talk about our main dynamic duo.Rentarou Satomi - A 16 year old agent fighting monsters. Not a bad premise to start with. He’s pretty competent when it comes to a fight but absolutely hopeless when it comes to using his brain. That said, he's not a complete idiot. His heart is in the right place, the problem is he follows it with little to no thinking things through. Especially when in the heat of battle. Something I do like about him is that he doesn’t run from the consequences of his decisions. He’s willing to take responsibility, even if that gets him in more hot water.Now let me tell You something moronic. When he was 6, his life was saved by a special, government program that dealt with cyborgs. Yes… the writers  thought that giving a 16 year old a backstory that gives him artificial limbs and eye as a goddamn 6 year old is a good idea. I mean… why? Who the fuck would even approved of this? A 6 year old still grows and has rapid growth spurs. Making expensive, combat prosthetics for a child is not only irresponsible, it’s a waste of resources. To be fair his backstory is total, edge-lord shit. He has combat prosthetics. Cool. You don’t have to make it so he practically grew up with them.He gets no growth throughout the show. He starts as a cocky asshole and ends as a cocky asshole. There are moments that show him care for others but they are few and far between. He has no personality, no interests and pretty much no goals. A perfect (and I use this word ironically) self insert for the viewer… or writer.Enju Aihara - Basically a loli jailbait #1. A 10 year old Cursed Child - a type of child that has gastrea virus inside of them, which gives superhuman abilities like a healing factor and enhanced physical abilities. She seems to have a pretty big boner for Rentarou and often tries to flirt with him. Let’s give credit where credit is due, the man rejects the idea of having anything romantic going on with a 10 year old.She’s cheerful, optimistic and caring. Despite being in a pretty shitty line of work and being something that most people treat like shit and a threat she doesn’t question her decision to defend civilians. Like Rentarou she doesn’t really change over time. She does have one scene of breakdown but it’s handled horrendously and it goes away the next episode. It’s a shame cause I think that out of every cast member she had the most potential and should have been the main protagonist. Her perspective on the world would be so much more interesting than what we got.Now the plot itself is pretty cliche but handled mostly correctly. Not great but far from being a total piece of shit. The greatest weakness is the pacing. The show can really do a number on the viewer. Towards the end one episode ends on a very dramatic note, only to start the very next one, in a pretty laid back atmosphere. Hell the whole episode turned out to be pretty laid back. That was pretty awful.Another thing is that the show shifts genres every few episodes. Especially in the beginning. I get it, mixing genres isn’t anything new and can be a good thing. If You have someone who can write this properly. I actually got pretty furious when the show began to act like a political thriller for 2 episodes only to drop EVERY aspect of that genre after capturing an assassin. Why the hell write an intro into politics and even give some detailed information about the power dynamic only to forget about it for the rest of the show?Let’s get down and dirty into the fight scenes.After some point our hero switches from using mainly a gun to using mainly his combat prosthetics. The problem is… neither of those are utilised well. The fight scenes when he’s using a gun are boring. It’s not on the level of Cowboy Bebop or City Hunter where You can see the stakes and thought put into them. Here we have shootouts that do close to nothing. In the very first episode we see how his gun is pretty useless against the monster and yet he still sticks to it… for a few more episodes at least.When he finally grows a pair and starts using his prosthetics to fight the scenes aren’t better. The only reason why You can follow the fights is that those aren’t really fights. Those are mostly executions. He sees an enemy, punches it, goodbye. Even the prolonged fights when he meets someone who can put up a challenge are pretty much the same, just require more frames. Again… boring but I’ve seen worse.The dialogs are a joke.They are either some lame jokes, stating the obvious or some kind of pseudo-dramatic stuff that made me cringe. I think the dialogs are the worst part of the show. The best dialogues happen when the show cosplays as a political thriller. Otherwise they are abysmal.All in all the show doesn’t have much going for it. It’s a middle of the road show with shitty dialogs and a plot that overuses deus ex machinas and plot armour. If You like to watch lolis killing monsters I guess You could find some entertainment in it but if You care about writing, You won't.Shame because I think the show had a lot of potential as a Sci-Fi political thriller, but decided to go the comedy-action route. exactly as bad as it sounds.The show follows the exploits of one Rentarou Satomi - a type of security agent who fights Gastrea - type of parasitic monsters, and his 10 year old (yes, it’s that bad) super-human partner - Enju Aihara.

At the time, I didn't really think about this anime much, so I've been analyzing it more this time around.The story is pretty basic and slightly predictable, which is kind of to be expected from an anime from 2014. Coming from its original source material, this adaptation is very loose. Of course, this is due to the fact that this would be adapted for 13 episodes. However, because of this, the story ends up feeling rushed and the pacing is all over the place. The contents of the story...are not bad, and in some cases are very good, but the way it's delivered leaves a lot to be desired, whether or not you are familiar with the source material.

In terms of the fact that I did not expect to see some kind of fanservice at all, that 10-year-olds would dry up on our gg and try almost to have children from him, however, not only 10-year-olds.The characters are not of particular interest, except for one. Kagetane Hiruko came to me personally. He is one of those antagonists in the first 3 episodes. His style.. and the tricks are just a bomb😘The plot is neither good nor bad, it seems like they provided everything they needed: A problem of universal scale, saviors, and...actually the solution to this problem. They show a good amount of drama related to children. Sometimes it was sad from the moments when a lot of children die under the tyranny of other people. After all, these children are cursed.The soundtrack - in principle, I liked everything, varied, tasteful. I also liked the opening, of course it's a matter of taste.The result is a complete average. Detective, drama, action here sometimes does not feel at all, it seems that in some moments it's just everyday life. actually the solution to this problem.

It started off with a bang and the Gastrea Virus was explained immediately. The writers got right to the point and made it very clear on what I should expect. The CGI was a little iffy at the beginning of the show but as the show progressed it really improved. The idea of the Cursed Children and the political aspects to it were wonderful and exciting to watch. Normally I don't pay attention to the more political parts to any anime, but they really got...me hooked by the end.Now that I have explained what I liked I will now explain the parts that in my opinion were not as great. The fast pace of some characters lives, especially Midori Fuse. I feel that her character along with Shouma. With Midori it felt like she had a lot more potential and more story to her. I strongly disliked the fact she died off camera and was found. It had the potential to hurt the viewer a lot more if she had died on screen. With Shouma I felt his death was a little cliche where he sacrificed himself in place of Rentaro. It's the same issue with his partner Midori, the writers could have made it more dramatic and more emotional. I honestly loved his character design and the was he presented himself with all the mystery surrounding him. I feel he wasn't done the justice he should have been given, he had a lot of unwrapping potential to his character.Total opinion- Was good, I am looking forward to season 2.Rated-6/10 Only because the season one ending didn't fit.Favorite Character- Kagetane Hiruko me hooked by the end.Now that I have explained what I liked I will now explain the parts that in my opinion were not as great.

Events are just happening without any relevance, explanation, or meaning. It jumps from one thing to another without any context as to why it was important or how it connects with prior or subsequent events. And as others have mentioned, there is weird loli crap going on. This anime is junk. Do not waste your time.*******************************************************I need to write more apparently, but there's honestly no more to say since this anime doesn't have a good plot or any sense of deeper meaning. "", ""Alright, before getting into the review, I'd still recommend watching this, if only to laugh uncontrollably at how confused you actually get.Story: 1/10The story is very stilted, both in pacing and content, with random information thrown in and then thrown out the next episode. It took like 8 episodes before an actual attempt at a plot was made, and then the story kinda has a flow to it, but I say this very lightly. The ending of an anime should tie everything together and clear up all confusion, but it both created more holes and made everything more confusing. The ending is like an incoming...nuclear bomb, you accept your fate, make your peace with god, and just let it decimate every atom of your body, leaving nothing. Incidentally, this story is nothing. Loli harem by the way. Not as bad as it could be, but having a cumshot fanservice in episode 1 is kinda L.Art: 6/10The art is pretty decent all around for the 2D portions, but there are some awkward frames, and the CGI was pretty sloppy, but that's to be expected of late 2000's and early 2010's anime. So other than that, the art was tolerable, some cool scenes, but not enough to justify whatever the hell they did in 3D.Sound: 6/102 points come out of the amazing opening, 2 points come out of the amazing ending, and 2 points come from like the two tracks that made the action bearable. A lot of the non-action scenes have some random ass violin in there or some flute track that doesn't match the tone. Ever. Not to mention the only good track for the action scenes sounds basically identical in every action scene.Character: 2/10Absolutely no character development, somehow people realize their true natures 13 episodes after they were supposed to develop those. For the ones that didn't have true natures, well they didn't have natures to begin with. Nobody did. Hell, a friend of mine watching thought a certain character was named Brick Nigel until the very end only to realize that he was not, in fact, Brick Nigel.Enjoyment: 5/10First time watching: 0/10. Very disappointed throughout, didn't really feel worth it. Second time watching: 10/10. My main mistake the first time was having expectation about this anime.

It did not double down on the conflict of the story and the characters who serve to play that story out. The beginning of the anime even has plot points that aren\'t addressed at all later in the show. It is annoying, as it feels like the show completely fell on its head towards the end and is relying on a second season that will probably never come. The characters had a chance for being extremely morally gray and their decisions could have been examined to help develop the world and...the psyche of the people living in it, but instead the show loses focus on that and instead choses to focus on loli harem shenanigans. Sure this can be a sort of juxtaposition of the story and have it open and/or close episodes to keep them still enjoyable and not super dark all the time. Even the op contains this, with some extremely moody and edgy scenes, followed by harem and tsundere actions that have no right to be there at that moment in the op or anime. At least the first half of the show attempts to tell a clear story. The second half is messy and loses what little character development the anime tries to create in the first half of the show. The show tries to make up for this loss with shock value and the main character sulking around, but that just kills the show more. The final showdown in the show doesn\'t even involve the main character much, and a lot of it happens too quickly and off screen. The killing blow is made by a character who gets developed in the last 3 episodes of the show, and that too, not by much. The love interest is messed up at the end of the show, and is basically just bait for a second season, and a love interest was created right at the end of the show for seemingly no reason. The show tries to do too much right at the end (almost like it was procrastinating) and is just wasted potential.Sound:The sound is probably the worst aspect of the show. At its best it is a normal and barely helps to add to a scene, and at its worst, it downright undermines the events that happen in the show. There is one scene that is emotionally scarring and visually shocking, and the music team decided on picking a recorder solo for it. As a music person myself, the recorder is an extremely hard instrument to put into a show, especially a show like this, due to the general perception of the instrument. The recorder is known to be an introductory wind instrument and for a lot of people, is synonymous with poor music and squeaky sounds. This can be felt directly as the music and the events that take place afterward (which is just the main character sulking around, because of course it is) are at a perceivable crossroads with each other. If it were me, I would rather have a solo piano or solo flute or another instrument that conveys fragility and vulnerability to accurately depict the feelings the main character is going through and the consequences of the event.Art:The art of this show is pretty standard when it comes to your ""edgy protagonist saving the world"" style of anime. The main character looks straight out of SAO and the human side characters have pretty standard designs. This really stinks, as the show could have had a way more interesting art style that help set it apart from a lot of the other shows about word ending devastation. The animation is also pretty normal. Nothing is too crazy in terms of movement, but in certain scenes, the fights looks not too bad. The anime shows so much potential in this category, but falls completely flat due to its close contact with similarity and the general audience.Overall:The only saving grace of the anime is the fact that the visuals are not bad. If you took a still frame of certain scenes, you could have a nice poster or emotional picture. This show could have been about really delving deep into the relationship between multiple factions and thoughts of our minds, as well as humanity in general, but the show completely misses the mark in this regard. The anime had an enormous amount of potential and could have easily turned into a deep retrospective on the evil of us and our primal instincts of egotism and self-sufficiency, but instead is about a bunch of loli girls and a regular sized yandere fawning over a bargain brand Kirito and his off brand Edward from Fullmetal Alchemist body parts. the psyche of the people living in it, but instead the show loses focus on that and instead choses to focus on loli harem shenanigans.

The anime first aired in the spring of 2014 and is based on a light novel series of which there are seven volumes.Personally, I didn\'t get to the anime right away, and then after reading some reviews, I decided to place it on the back-burner as a result. I think many went into this anime expecting a sci-fi version of Shingeki no Kyojin, otherwise known as Attack on Titan. And I can understand why, as there are three distinct similarities, but they end after those three. Well, there is...one more, but that is only because the lead voice actor in AoT for Eren, voices the lead in BB.The three similarities are:1. Humanity is driven to near extinction.2. They now live behind some walled infrastructure.3. Huge monstrosities are what created the extinction event and continue to plague humanity.When I first read the reviews, the reason the show seemed so reviled was people viewing the use of young girls in the show as lolis. And while most usage of lolis in anime has some form of relationship tension as the subplot or sexual innuendos, this is not the case here overall. Ok, let me get to the story and explain why.The story begins with an apocalyptic flashback of devastation as giant monsters attack. Cut forward ten years as our main protagonist Rentarou Satomi is hastily riding his bicycle in what appears to be a fairly revitalized city. He arrives on site and flashes his badge identifying him as Civil Security. People working in Civil Security are specially trained in eliminating Gastrea threats. Rentarou is a Promoter and his partner Enju is an Initiator. Each promoter is partnered with an initiator. But Enju is not with Rentarou at the moment and he is asked if he can handle the problem on his own. Rentarou acts confidently as he pulls out his handgun armed with Varanium bullets. Varanium is the only material that can apparently repel Gastrea and prevent them from regenerating if not killed outright. Sadly, the police had thought they could handle it on their own and a few officers rappelled down the building and entered before Rentarou. Rentarou charges in, only to find everyone dead, and our first look at whom would appear to be the show\'s antagonist and we witness our first confrontation. The assailant gets away with little effort.We cut to Enju, who fell off the back of Rentarou\'s bike and is running forward. She comes across a guy asking for directions who appears completely addled in the head. Momentarily, his body starts to burst and mutate until he becomes a large spider-like monstrosity. My first reaction to this was ""Oh no, not another Gibiate type anime"" Yes, I watched this in the fall of 2020 after watching Gibiate a month or so earlier. Enju quickly and utterly dispatches the monster with ease and only received a slight cut to her arm.That is our introduction to the two main characters of the story.I feel that people went into this anime fully expecting an action series of man vs monster. And while that is the overall premise, in my impression is actually the subplot of the story. And let me explain why.As I said earlier each promoter is partnered with an initiator. In a later episode, we find out that there are many Civil Security teams. Most of the promoters seem to be specialized with some form of weapon or skill set. Very much like a mercenary for hire, which is essentially what they are, as each works for one firm or another and get paid to deal with the Gastrea threats that pop up. The initiators though are all young girls, none older than the age of ten, hence where many get the loli image from. As it turns out, when a pregnant woman was infected prior to giving birth, some of the gastrea traits were passed along and slightly altered the genetics of the unborn child. This results in the child having untold strength, agility, and potentially some other subset of abilities depending on what type of gastrea inflicted the mother.And here is where we get to the actual story behind Black Bullet. While there is a healthy amount of action, the whole story arc is really about how the gastrea have affected our culture. The story deals a lot with how the ""Cursed Children"" are treated in society. Most of society views the cursed children as monsters themselves, even though physically, they appear no different from any other ten year old. And yes, there must have been a lot of pregnant women afflicted during the first outbreak. And here is another note; while a person can be affected, until their body reaches a certain percentage of infection they appear and act normal. They just are a ticking time bomb and don\'t know it. And this can take place anywhere from days, months to years as with the children. So since the beginning of the Gastrea outbreak, it has only been ten years so there is no Initiator older than ten years of age. The children are viewed as monsters by most of society and thus are outcasts, living outside the protected areas or in the sewers. Scrounging for food and money, some resorting to stealing. Others, like many of the Promoters, view them simply as disposable tools and are conscripted into service. For some, like Enju, this service means a better life, education, a roof over her head etc. Most though are still just treated like outcasts.Thus the show is about human nature, greed, and prejudice. An important lesson, especially during one episode is how children pick up the bad habits of adults, as Enju\'s friends at school do a 180 and treat her completely differently once she is outed as a ""Cursed Child"". These cursed children just want to be normal, lead normal lives. Have hopes and dreams for the future, though not knowing they can be ticking time bombs before their own infection goes above fifty percent.Besides prejudice, the story focuses on business and politics where again, greed and pride are big subplot points. Mostly culminating in the final episode. Though a couple of unanswered points are not addressed at the end. One dealing with Takuto Yasuwaki last actions not being addressed nor who Ayn Rand (a nod to the author Ayn Rand no doubt) is and what they are planning. I figure those are resolved in the rest of the light novel chapters.The animation artwork is fairly consistent with the mid-2010s. Nothing overly spectacular, but neither jarring or cheap looking. Decent overall. Occasionally, some of the digitally produced Gastrea don\'t blend as well as they could have. Luckily, those are few and far between.The music is very good, especially the opening by Fripside and endings performed by Nagi Yanagi. I appreciated how the end credit music would start gently before the end of the episode animation. And Haru Yamada did a very good job as the sound director. I watched it subtitled, so I can not speak for any translated versions out there.Overall it was an enjoyable show, but one you have to pay attention to all the small to little details to get the full and underlying story. one more, but that is only because the lead voice actor in AoT for Eren, voices the lead in BB.The three similarities are:1. Humanity is driven to near extinction.2. They now live behind some walled infrastructure.3. Huge monstrosities are what created the extinction event and continue to plague humanity.When I first read the reviews, the reason the show seemed so reviled was people viewing the use of young girls in the show as lolis. And while most usage of lolis in anime has some form of relationship tension as the subplot or sexual innuendos, this is not the case here overall. Ok, let me get to the story and explain why.The story begins with an apocalyptic flashback of devastation as giant monsters attack. Cut forward ten years as our main protagonist Rentarou Satomi is hastily riding his bicycle in what appears to be a fairly revitalized city. He arrives on site and flashes his badge identifying him as Civil Security. People working in Civil Security are specially trained in eliminating Gastrea threats. Rentarou is a Promoter and his partner Enju is an Initiator. Each promoter is partnered with an initiator. But Enju is not with Rentarou at the moment and he is asked if he can handle the problem on his own. Rentarou acts confidently as he pulls out his handgun armed with Varanium bullets. Varanium is the only material that can apparently repel Gastrea and prevent them from regenerating if not killed outright. Sadly, the police had thought they could handle it on their own and a few officers rappelled down the building and entered before Rentarou. Rentarou charges in, only to find everyone dead, and our first look at whom would appear to be the show\'s antagonist and we witness our first confrontation. The assailant gets away with little effort.We cut to Enju, who fell off the back of Rentarou\'s bike and is running forward. She comes across a guy asking for directions who appears completely addled in the head. Momentarily, his body starts to burst and mutate until he becomes a large spider-like monstrosity. My first reaction to this was ""Oh no, not another Gibiate type anime"" Yes, I watched this in the fall of 2020 after watching Gibiate a month or so earlier. Enju quickly and utterly dispatches the monster with ease and only received a slight cut to her arm.That is our introduction to the two main characters of the story.I feel that people went into this anime fully expecting an action series of man vs monster. And while that is the overall premise, in my impression is actually the subplot of the story. And let me explain why.As I said earlier each promoter is partnered with an initiator. In a later episode, we find out that there are many Civil Security teams. Most of the promoters seem to be specialized with some form of weapon or skill set. Very much like a mercenary for hire, which is essentially what they are, as each works for one firm or another and get paid to deal with the Gastrea threats that pop up. The initiators though are all young girls, none older than the age of ten, hence where many get the loli image from. As it turns out, when a pregnant woman was infected prior to giving birth, some of the gastrea traits were passed along and slightly altered the genetics of the unborn child. This results in the child having untold strength, agility, and potentially some other subset of abilities depending on what type of gastrea inflicted the mother.And here is where we get to the actual story behind Black Bullet. While there is a healthy amount of action, the whole story arc is really about how the gastrea have affected our culture. The story deals a lot with how the ""Cursed Children"" are treated in society. Most of society views the cursed children as monsters themselves, even though physically, they appear no different from any other ten year old. And yes, there must have been a lot of pregnant women afflicted during the first outbreak. And here is another note; while a person can be affected, until their body reaches a certain percentage of infection they appear and act normal. They just are a ticking time bomb and don\'t know it. And this can take place anywhere from days, months to years as with the children. So since the beginning of the Gastrea outbreak, it has only been ten years so there is no Initiator older than ten years of age. The children are viewed as monsters by most of society and thus are outcasts, living outside the protected areas or in the sewers. Scrounging for food and money, some resorting to stealing. Others, like many of the Promoters, view them simply as disposable tools and are conscripted into service. For some, like Enju, this service means a better life, education, a roof over her head etc. Most though are still just treated like outcasts.Thus the show is about human nature, greed, and prejudice. An important lesson, especially during one episode is how children pick up the bad habits of adults, as Enju\'s friends at school do a 180 and treat her completely differently once she is outed as a ""Cursed Child"". These cursed children just want to be normal, lead normal lives.

I genuinely struggle to find anything redeemable from an adaptation perspective.The fact that they skimmed over 10 chapters of plot and world building in a 30 second montage at the end of the last episode was especially painful.The only reason I don’t rate it lower is due to the source material.If this was my first encounter with the series, I probably would’ve dropped it by...the first or second episode.Read the manhwa instead, and forget this adaptation exists. the first or second episode.Read the manhwa instead, and forget this adaptation exists.', ""What an absolute breath of fresh air. In the world of fantasy anime, there's the trope of the OP protagonist. This anime has a slightly powerful protagonist (not OMG OVERPOWERED as of episode 7), but he has every reason to be strong. As he is repeating his life once again starting from school, his stronger powers make absolute sense. Imagine going back to high school and crushing it.

Do not judge this series by the anime, because they screwed up. The details that are missed hurt the anime so much as these details are crucial to help express the characters and show more information about them. Without these details, the anime turns bland and cliche, which is not what this story was meant to be.It's made very clear so far that there was very little research into anything but the basic art style. From names being changed (we could blame translators for the manhwa, but none of them translated the names differently) to the artwork and style being...laid out for the animators, but still being missed entirely. Much of what is going to be below is not going to categorized, mostly due to how many of the issues tie together and compound.The art and animation should have a good foundation, but it feels like so many small details went missed. The groundwork was laid out in the manhwa, and even for it being early for the original artist, they still did a good job with little details that add to the overall aesthetic and emotion for the scenes that take place in the manhwa. This was entirely missed by the studio that animated this. The animation is ok, but it the art style and little details could have made it much better. There seems to be little to no reason for the of the details missed.In the second episode during the fight between Adjest and Desir, the manhwa shows that when Desir shoots past Adjest, his eye is closed and bloody, and he has a grimace on his face from pain. In the adaptation, he has a grin on his face, and it seems like he's unscathed. The whole point was that he took damage and persevered through the pain in order to win, and the anime left these things out entirely.These little details change the weight of the scene entirely, and makes it feel like a cliche trope that we've seen everywhere where someone is overpowered. This is not Desir at all. His character was meant to be represented in this moment. This is meant to show that he has the experience and has felt pain before, and he will go through that in order to succeed. Desir knows what is at stake, and it's more than just an entrance ceremony to him. This is but one step in order to save the world. Success is a must, and to him it seems clear that he needs to succeed. This is what sets him aside from the others. Leaving these little details out, leaves the potential to express these things and make them clear.To tack on to lack of details, brings me to dialogue issues. In episode three when Pram loses the fight to Percivus and Desir intervenes, Percivus should have a flashback to being scolded when treating commoners poorly, but this doesn't happen in the anime. Pervicus is supposed to have this core memory that fuels and explains part of his hatred for commoners.There is key dialogue from Desir in moments like episode five where Desir makes note that the property is fairly secure. In the anime they instead have him touch the door and say security is perfect? I think something got lost in translation, but the message still comes across, I guess. When they walk in in the manhwa, Desir notes to himself that there is even a barbarian (Estaban) securing the door. The anime leaves this detail out, and he just mentions that it's heavily guarded. This is another moment that his knowledge and experience can be shown but is missed entirely.To summarize everything above, there was a gross lack of understanding of the materials and details of key moments. These details that are missed are important for events and characters that will come up in the future and will help reinforce some of the information that will be needed and will add to backstory of characters later on. It seems that there was no one that actually took on to research and read the story, or to double check that everything is represented well.

Why hasn\'t it been done yet?""That was me with this show--- about 5 years ago when I first started reading the Manhwa.After completing it I can safely say it absolutely FLOPPED and did not live up to expectation like with Attack on Titan or Mushoku Tensei. But looking back on it, the signs were there and realistically even with better animation or editing this was about the level of quality to be expected.I will put it here if you don\'t want to read the following ramblings: This is show...is not very good, is kinda boring, but provides a bit of entertainment if you like Isekai, Fantasy Academy stuff.I can\'t comment on the Manhwa since I only read maybe a hundred chapters years ago and honestly don\'t remember much about it, but I think that in and of itself says something.Minor Spoilers, if you couldn\'t figure it out from the title, the main character of the story is Desir, a magician, who goes back in time to save his friends(?) and his magic and his use of it is abnormal, special even one could say. Now, as it sounds this should be a fairly standard I-Can\'t-Believe-It\'s-Not-Isekai fantasy story that feels like an Isekai because of the aforementioned premise, but there were a few points to it that make it, or would have made it, a more interesting story.First, the protagonist isn\'t overpowered, sorta. Much like many other stories from Korean authors, Desir isn\'t overpowered because of some God-Given Gift or power but rather his own intelligent use of his abilities, skills, and knowledge.Second, he is returning to save people who had died rather than for some self-serving purpose. Instantly makes him a more likeable and supportable character whom has their own autonomy.Third, a harem. You know it. I know it. We watch these shows because it tickles that little funny part of our monkey brains for a nice dopamine hit. However, this show spices it up by making it a more pseudo-harem feel. Like in his eyes he loves them, as his kids, and not as romantic partners so it doesn\'t feel weird and makes it more wholesome while having fairly legitimate reasons for them to interact the way they do.Now putting that all together you get a show just as interesting as you reading me list out all of the interesting things about the show. It\'s bland, tasteless, but also exactly what you came for while knowing it may or may not have something fun or exciting to read.Did that blow your mind?Don\'t worry, I only noticed after I had written out that entire dissertation and realized it truly encapsulated what the show felt like.If this review bored the crap out of you, there\'s your answer.

We then follow him trying to change what happened originally, to hopefully change the outcome of the world's possible end.The plot is very much about the growth of characters and to start building up...knowledge and power, so they can stand together.

You explore Desir’s past throughout the season and start to understand why he is making specific choices, so you don't see him evolve that much, but instead learns more about him and his past. The other characters you see grow, overcome obstacles and have a steady progression forward.This is also a show that sticks very close to the original fantasy vibe, where magic is not explained by levels, but instead is purely based on skill and abilities.The show also has a specific style of animation that puts much focus on colors, which can especially be seen in the characters' hair, since they have some interesting color schemes.Overall, is this a good fantasy anime that has a nice plot and some stereotypical roles done right, so i would definitely recommend giving this a watch. knowledge and power, so they can stand together.

A magic school anime with a twin-tails tsundere heroine? WHAT YEAR IS THIS?So yeah the show is built around some well-known tropes, typical MC-looking MC, aforementioned tsundere, ""I can\'t believe he\'s a boy"" boy sidekick, but they are done well, MC is not too generic, tsundere is not overdone.Overall it is a rather light, easy watch, typical magic school story, but there\'s a dark twist right at the start, which gives a considerable amount of weight to the story: there is the well-known thought experiment of ""What would you do differently if you...could travel back in time and be your younger self?"". Well, the MC has to do a lot different because in his original timeline humanity basically got wiped out.So it is rather interesting watching him going up against the end of the world, but with a lot of future knowledge. Other than the lingering fact that humanity might soon be facing total annihilation, the anime is lighthearted, but we are reminded here and there that the MC is actually taking everything very seriously.Some (for me) very important factors: no harem, no fanservice and the MC and his party are not OP.Obviously, they are strong, since the MC has future experience, and he picked people to his team who he already knew are going to be strong in the future (but not strong enough, that\'s why he\'s focusing on improving their skills even further), but still they are no all-stars, each of them has their strength and weakness. MC is basically an anti-mage, but he is not very good at the offense (for example at some point he\'s shown to be helpless against a pack of rats). The tsundere girl has powerful magic, but she needs to be protected and the boy is an ""agility tank"" (I am a big fan of party-based RPGs). Actually there is an all-star magic knight, but she\'s on the opposing side, making it feel like an uphill battle, and overall our heroes\' situation makes them the underdogs.Other things:Art/animation is fine and rather simple, there aren\'t grand animated spells and CGI monsters look like CGI monsters (but they don\'t appear often).Humor: There are funny little animations and they did the tsundere thing quite well, it is funny watching her react to stuff.Background music is fitting, and ED song is my favourite ED of the season.Overall I would recommend it, it is obviously not the anime of the season, but they weren\'t aiming for that.It is good for what it is, easy not too generic fun. could travel back in time and be your younger self?"".

Nah, that\'s just extra time and effort we have to put into the story. Hmm, but we still have to get multiple seasons out of it for revenue.... Eh.. Whatever, most people probably won\'t read the Manhwa anyways.""Lots of content hasn\'t shown up from the Manhwa for this anime, it skips lots of plot points that would be typically displayed, that would otherwise assist the plot....To be honest, it seems like a lazy effort from it\'s producers to skip these plot points. These plot points would otherwise help those who haven\'t read the Manhwa, to understand the story and it\'s ""why\'s"" and ""how-come"" moments that exist in the anime adaptation.Take that for what its worth, or watch it and compare it to the Manhwa if you would like to know what I am referring to.The animation even seems a bit basic for what it tries to accomplish, and I am not talking about character designs, I am talking about quality that you see averaging across the episode, it seems to only focus some specific battle scenes to have all the production value, otherwise it sometimes has some PowerPoint type panning across the screen, or fix framing a specific reaction from a character for 5 seconds (it tends to happen a few times an episode), and they also look moderately more simplified outside of intense conversations or battles.This is on top of every episode feeling like it\'s 1/2 of what it should be, it seems to try and force itself to slow down to save content for future seasons, even when their seems to be plenty of stuff they could add to the anime from the source material instead of making conversations made to be slow to extend the view-time, and making battle scenes last 3-4 minutes (which is very disappointing).And this wasting time, is the worst aspect of the show. For a quick comparison for the artificial extension; The anime ""MF Ghost"" (released this season) does this by going to side characters for their reactions, but at least it shows something different and(albeit poorly) tries to keep the pace of the show. This anime on the other hand, tries use tension or intrigue to drive a few separate conversations to be 10+ minutes combined throughout an episode, sometimes slowing the plot and pace down dramatically after each fight scene. It doesn\'t try to keep the pace the same throughout the series, which gets more noticeable the more you watch it, and it gets very boring to see this reoccurring.I will say, the best part about this anime is the fight sequences, they are well constructed and make use of most of the source material, but these do still leave out big details from the plot.I don\'t recommend it. 6/10, it isn\'t necessarily bad, but it really likes to waste time and cuts out source material, but mainly keeps the lengths of the episodes lengthened artificially, so it gets to be a bore sometimes.I recommend ""My Daughter Left the Nest and Returned an S-Rank Adventurer"" as a possible alternative to this; It has a smaller budget is so the animation isn\'t as good, but the story is cohesive, enjoyable, and has some similar themes to this.Thanks for reading. 🗿 To be honest, it seems like a lazy effort from it\'s producers to skip these plot points. These plot points would otherwise help those who haven\'t read the Manhwa, to understand the story and it\'s ""why\'s"" and ""how-come"" moments that exist in the anime adaptation.Take that for what its worth, or watch it and compare it to the Manhwa if you would like to know what I am referring to.The animation even seems a bit basic for what it tries to accomplish, and I am not talking about character designs, I am talking about quality that you see averaging across the episode, it seems to only focus some specific battle scenes to have all the production value, otherwise it sometimes has some PowerPoint type panning across the screen, or fix framing a specific reaction from a character for 5 seconds (it tends to happen a few times an episode), and they also look moderately more simplified outside of intense conversations or battles.This is on top of every episode feeling like it\'s 1/2 of what it should be, it seems to try and force itself to slow down to save content for future seasons, even when their seems to be plenty of stuff they could add to the anime from the source material instead of making conversations made to be slow to extend the view-time, and making battle scenes last 3-4 minutes (which is very disappointing).And this wasting time, is the worst aspect of the show. For a quick comparison for the artificial extension; The anime ""MF Ghost"" (released this season) does this by going to side characters for their reactions, but at least it shows something different and(albeit poorly) tries to keep the pace of the show.

Everything is pretty standard for a moderate budget adaptation.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10...------------------------------------------The show has some cool battle themes, but ultimately nothing overly noteworthy.Story - 7/10-------------While full of common fantasy tropes, the story is fairly interesting. A young man who studied magic and adventured for 10 years with countless friends and colleagues, gets sent back in time when a catastrophic event destroys the world.With his knowledge of the future, and some extra skills at his disposal, he will attempt to rewrite the events that lead to the catastrophe and save the world, along with all his friends and allies.And pretty much the entire runtime of the show, he will attempt to do just that. Recruit his friends and allies, and help them train to become stronger than they were in the previous timeline, in the hopes that it will be enough this time.The story doesn't much innovate, but it's more interesting than most.Characters - 7/10---------------------The cast doesn't receive a whole lot of attention. A lot of their personalities and motivations, and personal history are left unexplored save for a few short flash-backs.Still, the protagonist is quite well done. Having come back with knowledge of the future, he is more composed, confident and capable than his age would assume. Having such an adult like teenager be the main character in what's essentially a school training arc anime in Season 1, helps to do away with a lot of the common cringe tropes like the main character feeling like they're not strong enough, being all depressed, no knowing how to make friends, or not knowing how to talk to girls and whatnot. This is not a problem in this show, which is nice.Other characters are fairly nice as well, if a tad annoying at times.Nothing too remarkable however. A pretty standard cast for a teenage school anime.---Total - 7/10---Returner's magic is not particularly impressing, but it doesn't really drop the ball anywhere either. The visuals are fine, sound and music fine, story fine, characters fine.

I really enjoyed the Manwha, it was something different. Thought the anime adaptation skips throgh four archs in one season. I have mixed feelings about that. The archs that were skipped over had a lot of character building in them that was almost completely skipped over in the anime. On the other end, they did cover all of the important stuff that needed to be covered and I'm not sure if everybody would want to stick arround for two or three seasons of character development. So this very quick run through of the first part of the series was probably necessary...if they want to continue with this anime in the future. Personaly though I think that the final 3 episodes should have been the first six episodes in the next season.All of that said I would overall recommend this anime, if nothing else the story is something different from the norm. It doesn't tend to follow the typical anime script and it does tell the story decently well, enough that someone new to the series should be able to understand it.

While this loyalty is appreciated, it becomes a double-edged sword. The animated series could benefit from injecting its own creativity, especially in the battle scenes. The manhwa excels in showcasing stunning battles through illustrations, but the anime feels somewhat lackluster in comparison.

The MC, who is oddly named Desir, has to go back in time with his reincarnation and do it all over again- but this time actually defeat the monster in the end. Okay, that’s not a terrible idea. It puts me in mind of an old movie where a man is tragically murdered, and he’s committed too many sins...to get into heaven, so he’s told by an angel he has to go back and figure out his own murder…. in both cases this is a storytelling concept that isn’t original but it CAN be interesting if done right.So the real challenge for the main character- he needs to build the perfect team. And he already knows who the members are that he wants- but going back in time even the slightest change in what you do also changes the outcome- and things don’t go exactly like he thinks they will.

This gives the whole show a sort of empty feeling… like I know who the characters are, but nothing else. There’s no sense of time or place. There isn’t ANY concept of why saving the world is even important, since we never see people outside the college or the world he’s trying to save.Mostly what you get here is low-level game-mechanics magic battle with a small amount of characterization. The main character is a little too kind and too flat- he mostly just stands there and smiles at his enemies while defeating them in fights where he mostly stands still. Pram and Romantica are more interesting- at least they have clear motivations. But they mostly just fight too. The standout is Pram, who is the most animated character in the whole show- he darts all over the screen and has the best moves of the entire cast.But that’s all you get with this show- is some magic battles where the stakes are not very high, the tension is lacking, the characters hardly ever get injured and never really feel like they’re in any kind of danger. The major fight of the season was between Desir and a guy transformed into a ridiculous green lizard monster thing… and the entire time, the entire battle- the harder it tried the more I just laughed at its ridiculousness.

I even like that in the first episode there were flashbacks to people I don\'t know with no explanation except the main character grimaced in remorse and sorrow while having said flashbacks. I knew these people were important to him and gone. A good case of showing and not telling that stays true through most of the anime.After fighting a long war, the protagonist is sent back to high school. This is the fantasy magic high school...where they learn no basic skills except how to fight and the filthy commoners barely even get that. Protagonist now wants to use this opportunity to minimize the horrors of war by training his friends that do no know they are friends, using said friends to say ""fuck you, classicism"",  and tab bit of diverting terrorist schemes.We know nothing of the protagonist aside from ""commoner"", so there is a bit of Mary Sue energy. I am fine with this because there no kirito harem and love is not a focus. We don\'t need to know about protagonist because we understand the world around him by following him. Like in a video game where the map gets revealed as you venture to new spaces.The side characters and antagonists are fleshed out and feel like complex characters. Except that one noble teacher that is the personification of classicism, but he comes and goes. I personally like that the children are not objectified as sexy symbols.The fight scenes are pretty good. Sometimes you see some feet getting clipped into the floor and other animation errors, but I don\'t think that is a huge issue.Note that this anime ends in a setup for the next arc. Kind of like it is telling us to push for another season or read the source material. I liked it because now I can go do that.

However, this show committed 2 sins that I cannot tolerate: (1) It Bored The Hell out of me and (2) It confused me to no end. While usually I might write a review detailing the traditional aspects of a show and their qualities, everything in general was so mediocre that I didn\'t want to explain why everything was at best a 5/10. Instead, I will cover two things in this review, how it committed the aforementioned 2 sins.(1) Boredom - No Stakes, Bad Action, No...Way To Measure Strength.- When something has no stakes in it, you tend to start to ask yourself why you should care about what is happening. This was the case here. The first couple of episodes is as the synopsis says and then it drags on and on with no real sense of danger. The characters can\'t die in the school and we are never really given any idea as to why it would be so bad if the protagonists don\'t get transferred to class A. I mean, they\'re already training and getting stronger, our MC already knows everything cause he\'s from the future, and we already know that the characters that were in class B end uo being some of the strongest in the future. So really why should one care about anything that happens this season? And why would I get excited about something I don\'t care about?- The Action in this show did something unforgivable. It reminded me of the Last Airbender Movie and of the power scaling of Boruto. First I\'ll explain why it reminded me of the Last Airbender Movie. Several times we hear a character become impressed my the power and speed of magic being used but then when we actually see the magic it looks so incredibly lame. Powerful wind spells don\'t even leave a mark on a regular wooden wall, ice projectiles look dull and as harmless as a hard snowball, and both flames and stones that are moving so slow any normal person would be able to dodge them. And there in lies the connection. The spells and fighting are like the scene in The Last Airbender movie where the rocks fly at 2mph. It\'s very boring. As far as why it reminded me of the power scaling in Boruto, that mostly comes down to how inconsistent the characters are. You have a character do what appears to be a freaking light split blits in one scene, outrun and deflect spells in the other, and then get hit by a regular punch or be held up by characters who at any point of the story should have honestly been considered fodder. I am not joking when I say we have people moving like the flash and losing to a fight against someone who\'s best feat is throwing a sword and subsequently catching it.- This last aspect of boredom is very simple and ties in to the second category. We literally have no way of knowing what is supposed to be impressive or how anything works. Spells or moves that are reacted with shock and awe look the same as others that are met with phrases such as ""something of that level would never work on me."" Because of that you have to wait until the show tells you something is cool before you can think it\'s cool. Mind you, we have no idea why it\'s cool since we don\'t know how anything works.(2) Confusion - Why? How?-The two questions I found myself asking more and more as the episodes went by at what seemed to be a slower and slower pace. Like I previously said we don\'t know anything about how magic or fighting skills work and so nothing that\'s done ever feels satisfying. We see people training and supposedly getting stronger but we don\'t know how they got stronger. There\'s some mentions of magic circle tiers or something but that just makes it more confusing because said information seems to contradict the idea that some characters can become strong. Whenever that very contradiction is questioned we almost intentionally don\'t get a response. ""You have way less magic than me and the little magic you have is of much less objective quality than mine so why are you able to not only cast more than me but cast more powerful spells than me?"" Response: 🙂. Yeah, that\'s not satisfying, that\'s not funny, it just gives off a sense of laziness and a way to have the plot keep advancing. The magic system wasn\'t the only thing that is confusing, however. The choices of several characters is also very confusing, especially those of oir protagonists. I\'m talking serveral times where we end up learning that the plan all along was to almost purposefully lose or give the enemy an advantage but ultimately win because the MC is just better. This is especially the case IN THE FINAL BATTLE WHERE THEY WAITED FOR SOME RANDOM ARTIFACT MACGUFFIN (we we know nothing about) TO LITERALLY BE POCKITED BY THE VILLAINS BEFORE INTERVENING. *Sigh* sorry about that, but god the last two episodes were so stupid.Overall, when you get a show where literally nothing is explained, you\'re never given a reason to care, and you can\'t even unplug your brain and look at the fun action (because there is no fun action) you\'re left feeling two things: bored and confused.I honestly don\'t know why I didn\'t drop this but I had more fun writing this review than actually watching the show.

A Returners Magic Should be Special Manhwa is one of my favorites that I have read but unfortunately, this anime does not do it justice. The animation is pretty poor, with tons of still frames, and there's even filler. The whole show feels incredibly phoned in and half-assed. Starting off with the art style, the original manhwa is incredibly stylized with bold colors and lines, the spells look powerful, and the art style is unique. In the anime the colors are flat, the spells look like png assets,...and it just looks like a generic isekai. The fights lack any sort of impact due to the poor animation, and the show reuses clips to pad out an episode's runtime (the most egregious example being in episode 6 when the same clip of a certain character climbing up some stairs was played at least 5 times). Every scene in the show feels like its being extended to meet runtime requirements. Regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the show, I think you should read this series instead. and it just looks like a generic isekai.

But sadly, it isn't. The plot of this anime is pretty cookie-cutter for 2023. We've seen tonnes of anime with a tragedy-reset plot or an overpowered character in a school (The Irregular at Magic High School comes to mind, and that was nine years ago!). The problem with shows like these is that there's nothing much new to discover apart from the shallow world-building & hodge-podge mix of themes copied from various other franchises, plot twists barely existent, and like...junk food, most people understand these shows don't have a lot of variances to offer. But they still watch them for some brainless entertainment. As much as I want every anime to be unique, I guess there's a safety blanket of comfort anime to watch when one is in the mood.=====Story===== 5/10The story is fundamental and nothing special. Witnessing the eventual demise of the entire world, Desir's soul travels to the past to the time he joins the academy (quite convenient!). However, this time he assures himself that he will not let the tragedy occur again and will do everything in his power to prepare himself and the people around him for the doomsday. Shows like these are never meant to impress story-wise and a quota of only 12 episodes doesn't help (though it's not impossible, anime like Terror In Resonance & The Promised Neverland prove that it is possible.) There is another overused trope of the nobles vs commoners, which enables easy opportunities to set up internal conflict at the academy. And everything (conveniently enough) is settled through a ranking system. All these tropes and setups are utilized, just to tell a story that is a trope of its own.=====Characters===== 6/10The characters do give the show more color. While we have cookie-cutter tropes in this department, it is fun watching them bond with each other. Many stereotypes are used, like the evil teacher, the helpful teacher, the strong & silent girl who uses ice magic, the tsundere character, and the character that hates commoners. There is a sense of comfort in using generic characters. Some people may even enjoy that more since people, in reality, are more 'down to earth.' The problem is that their reaction to events is always predictable, and the appeal loses quickly. There is no amusing moment of changes or growth as a character. Every character can seemingly be symbolized as a line segment, traveling from A to B in a straight line without ups or downs.=====Art, animation & sound===== 8/10I think this department was a clear step up from the norm. Something about the visuals was more vibrant & colorful, especially the spell usage. A few soundtracks hit the sweet spot at the right time. The studio did a decently above-average job. But lights & sound without proper story guidance can only pull the weight so far before the fragility of it all shows itself. I think the animation itself could've been slightly better. It felt a bit lacking compared to the OST and the art (a lot of standing shots & weird movement.)=====Reasons NOT to watch=====If you're not interested in watching something generic or witnessing tropes you've most likely experienced prior, then I can tell that you won't enjoy this show. This show has most of the typical isekai/fantasy tropes of generic anime over several years prior.=====Overall===== 6/10I get the need for these shows. It's a comfort show where you can hop on and celebrate the MC's wins, and you don't have to use your mind actively. Unfortunately, I feel like we're being bombarded with too many of these kinds of shows as studios think it's probably a meager yet stable profit to capitalize on the folks attached to them.

Well, some episodes passed and all doubt I had has been dispelled and now I can say with confidence to avoid this show. Watching it was as annoying and as painful as biting your cheek while eating gummy bears, but instead of tasty jelly you are chewing on mud mixed with horse manure and gravel.It started very mediocre. Same old story, same old protagonist and same dreaded school setting with competition right around the corner and same old tensions between entitled/humble students.

The pacing in this is SLOOOOOOW, say what you want about Japanese mass produced Isekai/Moe fluffy, mass production does bring streamlining to production.Kikansha no Mahou wa Tokubetsu desu or A Returner\'s Magic Should Be Special is adapted from a Korea Manhwa and it shows, from the tropes favored by Korean creators to the character design to the pacing issues plaguing most Manhwas. Manhwas as a medium is IMHO a super inefficient form of storytelling, wasted screen space and lazy uninspired paneling work leading to scenes that add nothing to...the story besides padding out page counts. This unfortunately is ported over to the animation as well, with many scenes where the camera pans over set dressing in a poor attempt to build tension or drama, major offender being the tournament finals where they waste tons of screen time blasting the viewer with SFX from the gate opening then the slow pan over the participants back to the gate stabilizing back to the MC back to the gate changing color......you get the idea.Story: Shallow and slow af, they drag out each scene in order to hide the lack of substance, to anyone who is familiar with the genre you will be left with a ""that\'s it?"" when each episode or story beat concludes, no deeper exploration, no twist on the trope and not even basic setup and pay off.

For every piece of the genre pie that we can...easily get through manga, Webtoons also have their own iterations, with the only difference being in full colour, as opposed to the black-and-white manga standard. And in this season, we are presented with one such work: Kikansha no Mahou wa Tokubetsu desu a.k.a A Returner\'s Magic Should Be Special — author Usonan and illustrator Wookjakga\'s fantasy adventure time-travel series, being the equivalent to Ken Wakui\'s Tokyo Revengers, if only made in a fantasy realm.In a ravaged life of war with an armed party fighting against an evil labyrinth that has absorbed the world into its eternal darkness, only the strongest mages would remain to defeat the dungeon boss, which they did until its sac burst to bring out imminent, permanent destruction upon the world. But for one such mage, he finds himself mysteriously time-travelling back to the beginning of school days and only has one objective: by having retained all of the memories from the previous timeline, he will use that to thwart a repeat of that same catastrophe in the new timeline. That\'s the MC Desir Herrman for you, being one of the last 6 mages in a party of the strongest mages who\'s gone back 13 years to school to recruit the very same people in his party that would defeat the labyrinth\'s dungeon boss, by hook or by crook.The school that Desir once attended (and has to again) is the prestigious Hebrion Academy, the school for both nobles and commoners, split into Alpha and Beta classes, which is designed for students to receive the education best suited to their skill level, resulting in the best possible learning outcomes for all the students. But with that balance, soon came oppression between the two entities, because while the academy still placed the most skilled students in the Alpha Class, most of them were nobles who had been systematically trained from the beginning of their education, leaning the Alpha Class to an aristocratic, superiority-obsessed air to it. And in that sort of atmosphere, a commoner with the appropriate skills would sometimes rightly qualify for the Alpha Class but would always be pushed back into the Beta Class, which, other than the obvious difference of being the total opposite, was mostly composed of commoners who lacked any kind of support. Care and passion were not directed towards the students, as almost none of the lectures had proper professors assigned to them, making it extremely difficult for the commoners to reach their full potential.But there is a silver lining for the Beta Class commoner students (as well as nobles) wanting to make it into the aristocrat-stinking Alpha Class: Hebrion Academy\'s traditional Ranking Tournament, which also acts as a sort of midterm exam for the students. It starts off with the typical 1-on-1 tournament phase, which slowly dwindles down to the Top 30 students, who would use the academy\'s specially tailored and crafted Shadow World (which typically would be reserved for evil creatures to envelop their enemies) that\'s laden as both a survival-of-the-fittest battle royale and a team mission in top of it to avoid that world\'s catastrophe, which would round up the Top 9 to receive the Single Ranker title, regardless of either commoner or noble status.You might ask: What has everything above got to do with the characters? This is where the story and plot take their form.As mentioned, Desir\'s primary role is to recruit his party members to avoid the exact same catastrophe happening in the new timeline, albeit in their high school form. And the first of which he would meet is the Wind elemental attribute mage of Romantica Eru. She first depicts herself as nobility, having joined the Alpha Class and partnering up with one of the best parties in the academy, but after finding out that everything about her is falsified, Romantica is soon ""brought down to Earth"" back to the Beta class, where she has become the subject of infamy to both commoners and nobles. That is, until Desir\'s persistence that she\'d come to accept him after rejecting him many times through the persuasion of his time-travel knowledge (that she doesn\'t know about) and his training to refine her into a capable mage.The next to come would be the swordsman (or swords-boy, rather) of Pram Schneider, the blue-haired short boy who\'s perceived to be so cute and adorable that most people mistake him for a girl. How Desir found him is through the ranked tournament and the overly familiar torture of a fight between a noble and a commoner, being the son of a noble father that he\'d never met and taken care of by his commoner mother until her passing. To be expected, Pram starts off being the assumed commoner weakling that he is, until Desir picks him up, trains him, and utilises the last gift from the scum of a noble father of a rapier to defeat his opponent, to which he\'d lean towards taking care of everyone, even Desir himself, to the point of being a Tsundere-like child for his affection.The last of which is also the strongest of the bunch: Azest Kingscrown. Her being Hebrion Academy\'s school idol is a testament to who she is: the perfect top-excelling student and leading the academy\'s top Blue Moon nobility-only party but parading around in the Kingscrown name to avoid the anonymity about her: being the heir to the Hebrion throne as the Empire\'s Crown Princess. The tall, blonde-braid-haired girl certainly is a tour de force, the definition of a cold person who\'s disinterested in the things around her due to her affinity with ice magic. That is, until she meets Desir, and her world grows from a blue, cold-ish monotone to one of colour, with which she would become friendly and warm up to him, Romantica and Pram. Certainly, of which, said MC doesn\'t treat her differently from who she was before, and the party of 4 would become a united party to take down issues orchestrated by Desir.The biggest elephant in the room would have to be the lacklustre production. Please be reminded that Aniplex IS the head of the production committee for this show (and coincidentally, Project No. 9\'s ButaReba), and somehow this season, you have a double whammy of adaptations that are just straight-up inferior versions of their source materials. Arvo Animation, the studio best known for the Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai a.k.a We Never Learn: BokuBen series, I thought actually succeeded for once with Fall 2021\'s Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu a.k.a Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut, despite not having a lot of action in said source material. However, with almost ALL Korean manhwa, you can expect action at every corner, and sadly, the production just weighs the entire series down, almost to the point where the line between anime and manhwa just looks the same. Come on, Aniplex, you have a big (and I mean, BIG) budget; is this a test-ground experiment of sorts?The music...is as I\'ve expected: Japan\'s version of Shonen stuffed into a Korean manhwa, especially with FLOW\'s Shonen-sounding OP, comes from the J-Pop band famous for iconic theme songs from Naruto to Code Geass. It\'s decent, but it definitely fits the nature of the show to a T. The part that I don\'t get is Momosu Momosu\'s ED song, which just sounds like something you\'d expect to hear in a romance (if not rom-com) anime. So...a rather misconstrued misalignment of song selection, perhaps?Ultimately, I still come off of the pre-conception that with the failed abomination of Crunchyroll Originals adapting the Top 3 manhwa (Tower of God, God of High School, and Noblesse) back in 2020, Japan still has a long way to go before making a near-perfect Korean Webtoon adaptation.Maybe next season\'s Solo Leveling will change that perception?

Karneval (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/16035/Karneval_TV,"['Karneval is a mysterious series. By mysterious, I don\'t entirely mean it being filled with clues to be solved by some detective. What I mean is how the series comes together through its plot, theme, and most importantly the characters of the mysterious \'Circus\'. It spells out mystery in a variety of ways through fantasy and its elegant atmosphere. However, Karneval is one of those series that can be a hit or miss for potential viewers.The anime series Karneval is based off the manga of the same named written by Touya Mikanagi. With 10 volumes and counting, the manga has received some attention, enough for...an anime adaptation. So here we are, spring 2013 and the series makes it on to the screen for the very first time.To me, Karneval is one of those shows where a variety of things happen, some at the same time. The series has that fantasy background with majestic themes. The series focuses on a mysterious group known as the “Circus”. The way they dress seems to fit within this theme but their actions are a bit different. For a variety of reasons, this organization serves a protection force. In other words, they work to ensure that the safety of its people are guaranteed. To do things, it seems that its members relies on teamwork, magic, strategies, and even acrobat movements. It enforces the fact that its members are skilled enough for the task. Of course though, these tasks often puts its members of Circus\' lives at risks. There is danger ranging from armed kidnappers to mysterious creatures. Among other factors, the members themselves sometimes has internal factors that prevents them from accomplishing tasks at their best. But at any rate, this mysterious group known as Circus is the drive force behind the series.Two of the most prominent members associated Circus are Nai and Gareki. There is a lot of mystery going on between these two characters. For one, we learn that Nai is searching for something important. After a dangerous incident, he meets Gareki who saves his life. And here becomes their little adventure as Nai and Gareki becomes friends. On the surface, the two seems to get along but their characters\' basis contrasts greatly in comparisons. Nai is portrayed as a boy who is often feels like he is a loner along with feelings of cowardliness around certain situations. We can tell by his face expressions that he is quite nervous throughout each episode. On the opposite of the coin, there\'s Gareki. His expressions gives off a confident, rough, and sometimes arrogant atmosphere. He is also seen as fearless in many situations and doesn\'t hesitant to speak his mind to make the first move. Although they seem so different, the two becomes a compatible duo; in a rather peculiar fashion.The majority of the supporting characters makes up the \'Carneval\'. All of them seems to have specialized skills to handle various situations. For example, there is the beautiful and well respected girl Tsukumo who is skilled in acrobatics and is able to take down foes with a calm mind. There\'s also Yogi, a cheerful young man who is able to evoke fear through his magic. Then, there\'s the Hirato, the Second Ships\' captain with a mind of intellect capable of managing the team through various tasks. The point is that Carneval takes on challenges fearlessly and with precision to ensure its success. They work for the government and takes out the most dangerous individuals out of their world to ensure a place without fear. On the other hand exists another organization, one that opposes Carneval for their actions known as Kafka. They are even more mysterious as we know nearly nothing about them besides that they oppose the government and conducts in illegal activities. Yup, here it is again, mystery...The story of this anime adapted series is a bit difficult to comprehend. In fact, some fans may be confused to what\'s going on that may lead to a scratch on their heads. I\'ll say it out straight: the story is a bit blend and requires a bit of focus to enjoy Karneval at its fullest. Apparently, Nai used to be an acquittance or possible friend of a mysterious young man named Karoku. The accessory (bracelet) is a proof of his past relationship with him. Throughout the series, we also see Karoku make screen appearances but have little clue to his true origin or identity. Speaking of which, Nai\'s own identity is a puzzle throughout the series as well. His name literally means \'nothing\' in English. The way he looks also makes the boy seems quite feminine and his nervousness doesn\'t help him shape into a more masculine image. He often has to rely on others whether it\'s the tough bad boy Gareki or members of Circus. This makes the main male protagonist Nai a bit hard to appreciate or respect. He hardly develops throughout the series and becomes more frustrating to watch each episode as the only way he can achieve tasks is with the help of others. There\'s an old saying that goes \'if you want something done right, do it yourself\'. Nai is nowhere near that philosophy yet and becomes a pain to watch.There\'s also some confusion related to the other characters as the atmosphere of the show seems to be quite slow paced. Furthermore, it\'s even sometimes difficult to tell who the real antagonists are. Needless to say, the construction of the characters along with the plot are blend and hard to appreciate. On the bright side though, the action of this series flows quite well with the movements of its characters. Speaking of which, the characters\' designs are elegant and beautiful. Tsukumo can be seen as a mascot for this series by the way she is dressed. Then, there are the guys like Gareki and Yogi who gives off an impression with their good looks.The action of the series remains consistent enough. We can see that some of the adversaries throughout the series are truly dangerous and malevolent enough that only an organization such as Carneval itself can take them on directly. But even so, they sometimes struggle against them whether mentally or physically. In regards to the action, it is fluid and portrays the fantasy theme well. From the first episode, the acrobatic like movements of Tsukumo shows how capable she is. Then, there are the magic that gives off the fantasy vibes and more full throttle action with Gareki and his handy guns. The action is impressive enough to give the series a more serious mood when dealing with cases at least.Perhaps the beauty of Karneval makes up a large proportion through its visuals. The majestic feeling Karenval left me an impression of the show. The way the architectures are made in this series has that gothic feeling. The way the characters are dressed are also flamboyant especially Tsukumo and Gareki with their outfits. In my stances, the guys of this series are all dressed with a fancy style. Tsukmo is admired for her beauty, Gareki is dressed in a noticeable way, and Eva has that revealing style of fashion along with her straightforward personality. It\'s fan service in a way but in a more fancy style rather than the typical panty shots, up-skirts, etc.As for the soundtrack of this show, Karneval stands out only at average here for me. I\'m not exactly sure how the studios handled the OST but it\'s only noticeable during tense moments or when performances are out in the open. In other words, they only seem to stand out during prominent moments in the show rather than flowing properly. The OP song ""Henai no Rondo ""by GRANRODEO mixes in way with its fancy displays. Along with its ED song, ""REASON"" by KamiYU, both of these pieces of music works for the series. However, it\'s nothing special really, at least for me.In all, Karneval is an example of a show that can be a hit or miss for fans. Its mystical atmosphere might not be something for avid fans of shounen action or other other genres to get used to. However, its beauty is expressed through its artwork and themes. Despite this though, I still find the story a bit blend and out of place. It lacks the way to make an impact by the construction of its narrative, its poorly made main male protagonist, and weak development. For me, this series is more of a poor dark horse that exceed some expectations but other times drops the ball. Well, that\'s just me but if you have some patience, Karneval sometimes does have its moments. an anime adaptation.

His expressions gives off a confident, rough, and sometimes arrogant atmosphere. He is also seen as fearless in many situations and doesn\'t hesitant to speak his mind to make the first move. Although they seem so different, the two becomes a compatible duo; in a rather peculiar fashion.The majority of the supporting characters makes up the \'Carneval\'. All of them seems to have specialized skills to handle various situations. For example, there is the beautiful and well respected girl Tsukumo who is skilled in acrobatics and is able to take down foes with a calm mind. There\'s also Yogi, a cheerful young man who is able to evoke fear through his magic. Then, there\'s the Hirato, the Second Ships\' captain with a mind of intellect capable of managing the team through various tasks. The point is that Carneval takes on challenges fearlessly and with precision to ensure its success. They work for the government and takes out the most dangerous individuals out of their world to ensure a place without fear. On the other hand exists another organization, one that opposes Carneval for their actions known as Kafka. They are even more mysterious as we know nearly nothing about them besides that they oppose the government and conducts in illegal activities. Yup, here it is again, mystery...The story of this anime adapted series is a bit difficult to comprehend. In fact, some fans may be confused to what\'s going on that may lead to a scratch on their heads. I\'ll say it out straight: the story is a bit blend and requires a bit of focus to enjoy Karneval at its fullest. Apparently, Nai used to be an acquittance or possible friend of a mysterious young man named Karoku. The accessory (bracelet) is a proof of his past relationship with him. Throughout the series, we also see Karoku make screen appearances but have little clue to his true origin or identity. Speaking of which, Nai\'s own identity is a puzzle throughout the series as well. His name literally means \'nothing\' in English. The way he looks also makes the boy seems quite feminine and his nervousness doesn\'t help him shape into a more masculine image. He often has to rely on others whether it\'s the tough bad boy Gareki or members of Circus. This makes the main male protagonist Nai a bit hard to appreciate or respect. He hardly develops throughout the series and becomes more frustrating to watch each episode as the only way he can achieve tasks is with the help of others. There\'s an old saying that goes \'if you want something done right, do it yourself\'. Nai is nowhere near that philosophy yet and becomes a pain to watch.There\'s also some confusion related to the other characters as the atmosphere of the show seems to be quite slow paced. Furthermore, it\'s even sometimes difficult to tell who the real antagonists are. Needless to say, the construction of the characters along with the plot are blend and hard to appreciate. On the bright side though, the action of this series flows quite well with the movements of its characters. Speaking of which, the characters\' designs are elegant and beautiful. Tsukumo can be seen as a mascot for this series by the way she is dressed. Then, there are the guys like Gareki and Yogi who gives off an impression with their good looks.The action of the series remains consistent enough. We can see that some of the adversaries throughout the series are truly dangerous and malevolent enough that only an organization such as Carneval itself can take them on directly. But even so, they sometimes struggle against them whether mentally or physically. In regards to the action, it is fluid and portrays the fantasy theme well. From the first episode, the acrobatic like movements of Tsukumo shows how capable she is. Then, there are the magic that gives off the fantasy vibes and more full throttle action with Gareki and his handy guns. The action is impressive enough to give the series a more serious mood when dealing with cases at least.Perhaps the beauty of Karneval makes up a large proportion through its visuals. The majestic feeling Karenval left me an impression of the show. The way the architectures are made in this series has that gothic feeling. The way the characters are dressed are also flamboyant especially Tsukumo and Gareki with their outfits. In my stances, the guys of this series are all dressed with a fancy style. Tsukmo is admired for her beauty, Gareki is dressed in a noticeable way, and Eva has that revealing style of fashion along with her straightforward personality. It\'s fan service in a way but in a more fancy style rather than the typical panty shots, up-skirts, etc.As for the soundtrack of this show, Karneval stands out only at average here for me. I\'m not exactly sure how the studios handled the OST but it\'s only noticeable during tense moments or when performances are out in the open. In other words, they only seem to stand out during prominent moments in the show rather than flowing properly. The OP song ""Henai no Rondo ""by GRANRODEO mixes in way with its fancy displays. Along with its ED song, ""REASON"" by KamiYU, both of these pieces of music works for the series. However, it\'s nothing special really, at least for me.In all, Karneval is an example of a show that can be a hit or miss for fans. Its mystical atmosphere might not be something for avid fans of shounen action or other other genres to get used to. However, its beauty is expressed through its artwork and themes. Despite this though, I still find the story a bit blend and out of place. It lacks the way to make an impact by the construction of its narrative, its poorly made main male protagonist, and weak development. For me, this series is more of a poor dark horse that exceed some expectations but other times drops the ball. Well, that\'s just me but if you have some patience, Karneval sometimes does have its moments.', ""I wanted to like this show. Hand to God, really. It was probably one of the most visually unique programs I'd found in recent memory, and its commitment to the visual theme of a circus reminded me of Soul Eater's gothic design motifs in a refreshingly good way.But having finished its (insofar) only season, I feel exhausted, and yet, content-wise, I feel grossly underfed.The main problem is Karneval wants so badly to be a big, interesting anime with big mysterious overarching serial plot threads. It wants to do the FMA:B-esque slow, controlled, gradual reveal of information. All of its arcs (save for the one that...finds Gareki revisiting his childhood home—probably not coincidentally, the show's high watermark by a long shot), aim to pique the reader's curiosity about the mythos and the big picture first and foremost, but lose focus on being satisfying in the moment.So, throughout its run, Karneval withholds exposition and lore from the viewer, thinking it's being tantalizing, but it crosses the line well into confounding.So when it comes time to reap the benefits of all these seeds it had sown throughout the course of series—at the cost of its episode-to-episode (or even arc-to-arc) quality and general enjoyability—it fumbles. It simply can't cover them all. It shucks and weaves throughout a giant, chaotic battle climax to touch base on them, and satisfyingly concludes none of them. (Probably the most egregious offender is Nai's quest to find his old friend Karoku—an incredibly enigmatic character, frequently teased by the narrative, whose role and character are both woefully underexplained, even by the show's end.)I haven't read the manga, but what this smacks of is a poor adaptation, biting off more source-material plotlines than the anime had room to chew. With its lack of conclusions, and so many balls still in the air, characters introduced to hardly ever be used, not to mention its too-optimistic sequel-begging final scenes, I feel like I just finished watching the pilot to a show, not its entire first year (and possibly its entire run).And sure, the visuals are amazing. The characters are fun to watch interact with each other, even if they are a little short on development (although, with a cast of 24 characters for a 13-episode series, it was inevitable some of them would have wound up a little undercooked—again: overambitious source material selection). But all in all, I'd say unless there's something about the premise or the art that really speaks to you, getting invested in Karneval is primarily a discouraging venture. finds Gareki revisiting his childhood home—probably not coincidentally, the show's high watermark by a long shot), aim to pique the reader's curiosity about the mythos and the big picture first and foremost, but lose focus on being satisfying in the moment.So, throughout its run, Karneval withholds exposition and lore from the viewer, thinking it's being tantalizing, but it crosses the line well into confounding.So when it comes time to reap the benefits of all these seeds it had sown throughout the course of series—at the cost of its episode-to-episode (or even arc-to-arc) quality and general enjoyability—it fumbles.

That\'s what I would say if I had to sum up my thoughts on Karneval.Just looking at it - either the promotional artwork, the first few scenes of the anime, or the manga artwork - you can easily tell that it\'s pretty. Characters are drawn in pleasing ways and colours are bright and sharp. The animation of the series is also very well done - everything moves smoothly, action scenes are generally well directed, and CG is used to great effect. I have to admit, even the soundtrack is pretty solid.That\'s the flash I mentioned. In terms of substance, this is...where Karneval suffers.Let\'s start with the plot. The story revolves a mysterious boy named Nai who encounters the thief, Gareki, and the defense organization, Circus, in his search for an even more mysterious man named Karoku. Through Circus, the two also get involved in fighting against a criminal organization by the name of Kafka.It\'s quite straight forward, but for some reason, the anime goes through the motions of having a plot that\'s a lot more convoluted. For several episodes, antagonists seem to be plotting something or other, having to do with capturing Nai for whatever purpose, and in the meantime, Circus fights against human-like monstrosities; however, there is no direction or purpose for a long time. Random things just seem to happen inexplicably with no apparent end goal. Kafka as an organization doesn\'t even come to play until about the halfway point of the series, and even after the finale, I\'m still uncertain just what Kafka\'s exact goals are.I have a feeling the writers were going for the approach wherein there\'s a mystery and tidbits of information are gradually given to the audience to heighten the anticipation and excitement. However, as I said, the plot of Karneval is actually quite straight-forward when laid bare, so the added convolution and vagueness makes it feel too confusing  for its own good. The worst of it is the whole search for Karoku. By the end of the series, he\'s even made a few appearances but we still have no idea who he is or why he\'s important.To make matters worse is the issue of pacing. Karneval is 13 episodes long, which is relatively short when you have a plot involving mysterious organizations, plenty of action, and missing persons and lost identities to be found. This means that, ideally, every episode should count. However, Karenval squanders away good chunks of its time with having the cast go to parades, put on circus shows, or help a boy find a restaurant...or something.Now, this might all be a little forgivable if the characters were interesting. All right, they look great and, initially, they all seem really cool, but remember how I said ""All flash, no substance""? Yeah, that again.As the story progresses and each character gets their screen time, I came to realize that there was literally nothing original about any of them. Nai is innocent and cute, but ultimately weak and a crybaby. Gareki is the ""Jerk with a Heart of Gold"", the guy that doesn\'t like getting close to people but actually cares for them deep down inside. Also, for being a main character, he doesn\'t actually do a whole lot, something he actually realizes by the end. Tsukumo is sometimes hailed as a strong female character, and yeah, she can fight, but ultimately she\'s an emotionless, detached girl who isn\'t all that interesting. Yogi stands in contrast to Tsukumo - he\'s cheerful and bright, which is a nice breath of fresh air, but later on in the series, his continued exuberance and idealism make him more of a man-child and I found myself wishing we could see a different  aspect of him.There are a number of other characters in the story, but they aren\'t given as much screen time as the main four and they, too, suffer from the same lack of depth and/or originality. It\'s really a shame because a number of them have the potential to grow into very interesting characters.All in all, Karneval was a huge disappointment for me. Obviously, a lot of work and money was poured into this, but it was wasted on a cast of derived characters and a lacking plot. where Karneval suffers.Let\'s start with the plot.

We\'ve seen this happen with shows like Black Butler, Fruits Basket, and Attack on Titan, but they\'re the lucky ones in this regard. Their source material sells quite well, so there\'s always going to be a vested interest in making a continuation or indeed, a full-on reboot. Some shows, unfortunately, aren\'t so lucky. There\'s a whole host of shows that got one 13-episode season before fading away into obscurity because the BD sales were poor. For every Black Butler or...Attack on Titan continuation, there\'s a Deadman Wonderland or No Game No Life condemned to a life of obscurity. It doesn\'t matter if these shows are accessible outside of Japan either, because the executives who run these studios only care about their bottom line. But what happens if a studio goes bankrupt before establishing a bottom line of any sort? My friends, today we\'re going to be talking about the tragedy of Karneval and by extension, the inevitable collapse of Manglobe.Karneval is a show about a thief named Gareki and a mysterious boy named Nai. Both of them got roped into an organisation called Circus that investigates and exorcises creatures called Varuga; superhuman abominations that feed upon complex organisms like humans. These creatures are the result of experimentation by an organisation called Kafuka, whose goal is to spearhead human evolution. That\'s as best a summary as I can come up with, given how little the show tells us. Karneval as a show has so many ideas, concepts, and plot points that it wants to introduce. Unfortunately, that short season doesn\'t allow for these things to be fully fleshed out. Considering how the manga is approaching the 140-chapter mark at the time of writing, this only spells out a complete recipe for disaster. Then again, that\'s probably not an entirely fair assessment to make. The show itself does try to elucidate us on its inner workings; Manglobe did succeed in some regard, but they didn\'t quite hit a home run, so-to-speak.Had this show been a proper 24-episode season, I\'m sure we would\'ve had more shown to us. Unfortunately, that\'s not the finished product that aired on TV. Instead, we have a foundation for a story to be built upon rather than a narrative proper. That sad fact\'s reflected in the ending as it implied more is yet to come. Considering how it\'s been a little over seven years since Karneval ended and how Manglobe went bankrupt in 2015, it\'s unlikely we\'ll ever get more. Enough bellyaching about its flaws though, because there\'s still merit found in what we have. While the story\'s atrophied in terms of depth and detail, Manglobe provided us with sufficient context for the premise. If a prospective viewer intends to watch this show purely for entertainment without analysis, they wouldn\'t have much trouble doing so. We never find out much about the backstories of Circus agents like Yogi and Tsukumo, but there\'s plenty of context surrounding Gareki and Nai to provide some rudimentary picture of their origins. What\'s more, the bits of the story elucidated to the audience provided a framework for later events to follow during the show\'s run.Speaking of which, the Circus agents we\'re introduced to might not have much in the way of backstory. Even so, that still doesn\'t stop them from having fleshed out personalities, motivations, and investments. We know that the stress of the job presumably takes its toll on Yogi; that\'s why he\'s so dedicated to making the people around him smile. We never learn anything about Tsukumo\'s past, but her sensibilities on the battlefield and her compassionate demeanour make her a crucial ally. We know even less about the First Ship agents and their dynamics, but mutual respect and rivalry between both teams are readily apparent. Perhaps I may be looking too deep for merit, but these are details are so insignificant that other studios opt to neglect them entirely. The fact that Manglobe went through the trouble to even flesh them out, even partially, shows that there was someone on the writing staff who cared about it.On the subject of the premise, it\'s admittedly cliche on some level. However, I\'d argue that it\'s different enough to make this show unique. Unlike other animes like Bleach, D.Gray-man, and Black Butler, Karneval\'s not quite a supernatural series. The Varuga are indeed superhuman, and their deaths throughout the show come across as if they\'re exorcisms. However, they\'re explicitly monstrous aberrations of humanity and not some paranormal force. Their transformation can happen one of two ways: contact with tainted blood or through the use of drugs that spark these changes. Circus agents can fly, have superhuman powers of their own, and can conjure weapons whenever they please. However, these powers come from a treatment which alters their cellular makeup. Karneval may look like some flashy supernatural action flick, but it\'s far closer to sci-fi than anything else. Think SOLDIER from Final Fantasy VII instead of the Black Order from D.Gray-man.Moving away from the story and characters (or lack thereof), let\'s talk about the superficial aspects of this show. Before going bankrupt, Manglobe was renowned for giving each anime they worked on a distinctive look. These were the guys who created shows like Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, after all. Karneval is no exception, as the general aesthetic of the show blends elements of both shonen and shojo anime. That fact isn\'t too surprising though when you find out that Karneval is a josei manga. Gareki looks like any edgy shonen protagonist, but some of the other characters have those distinctive shojo manga eyes with the gangly proportions to boot. This fact is most apparent with Nai, as he looks like Kaworu Nagisa if he were the uke this time around.As for the designs of the Varuga, they\'re all quite varied in appearance and capability. From what I\'ve seen during the show\'s run, some Varuga can hide their monstrous form while being able to pass for normal humans. Those monstrous forms aren\'t necessarily the stuff of nightmares, but their transformations can spook a viewer who isn\'t ready for it. At least, that\'s what I try to tell myself because that first Varuga in the pilot episode scared the hell out of me when she started transforming. Subsequent transformations didn\'t catch me off guard, but first impressions tend to stick with you. I certainly can\'t fault Karneval for having original monster designs.The animation quality throughout the show is spectacular, but that\'s no surprise given Manglobe\'s reputation. Action scenes are fluid and enthralling to watch, especially by the show\'s end. Manglobe also spared no expense the stupider antics involving the gag comedy or the festival performances. Sometimes the jokes fell flat on me, but they were still lovely to look at regardless. While my formerly keen eye for animation errors has admittedly diminished, I couldn\'t personally make out any glaring animation errors throughout the show\'s run. I wouldn\'t necessarily call this show Manglobe\'s best from a stylistic or animation standpoint, but it\'s still quite a cut above average.The audio side of things is also quite lovely. The opening track, ""Henai no Rondo"" by GRANRODEO is a bombastic J-Rock track that quickly sets the tone for events to follow. It\'s fast-paced, it\'s upbeat, it\'s incredibly energetic, and it\'s such a joy to listen to at the start of every episode. Similarly, ""Reason"" by Kamiyu is quite a catchy and fun ending track. I generally don\'t like ED tracks that clash with the heavy tone that some episodes end on but Karneval\'s storytelling is atrophied in terms of depth and detail anyway, so it\'s not like anything of value was ever lost.I\'m quite late to the party as far as the dubbing ""controversy"" is concerned, but I can\'t say I had any problem with it. I\'d even argue that the dub is pretty fucking good. Greg Ayres typically plays the \'loveable goofball\' character, so I can understand why some people would take umbrage with him voicing Gareki in the first place. Even so, Ayres does quite an excellent job at conveying Gareki\'s sarcastic and taciturn demeanour. The rest of the cast does a fantastic job too, my favourite performances being Sean Michael Tongue as Nai and Ian Sinclair as Hirato. Sean Michael Tongue does a beautiful job conveying Nai\'s boundless optimism and confusion at the circumstances surrounding him. Similarly, Ian Sinclair perfectly captures Hirato\'s nature as a stern yet compassionate commander with a bit of a jovial streak. It honestly is a great dub, and I still find myself confused at all the people who think it\'s shit.Would I say that I enjoyed watching Karneval? The answer to that question is a resounding ""yes,"" and I\'m not ashamed to admit that in the slightest. I\'d even go so far as to recommend that you watch it, were it not for the fact that this is sadly a glorified trailer for the manga. Unfortunately, the entertainment value I got from watching Karneval isn\'t enough to override my critical faculties. Karneval is an unfinished product when push comes to shove; I honestly found myself craving a greater sense of resolution than what we ultimately received. With that said, the anime certainly left a positive impression on me that does give me an impetus to check out what the manga has to offer. Of course, other people might not be as forgiving, so your mileage will undoubtedly vary.Lastly, I want to take a moment to reflect upon Manglobe as a studio and what they brought to the table. My introduction to Manglobe\'s works was obviously through Samurai Champloo, as it was for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of other people. I certainly had my gripes with it, but it was a fun, stylistic show with a fantastic soundtrack and dub that I still adore to this day. With this in mind, I feel like Manglobe might have shot themselves in the foot with such a strong debut. Their subsequent shows never quite managed to achieve the same level of success that Champloo did, so I\'d wager that they relied heavily on short seasons to offset any potential losses that their shows might bring to the table.Unfortunately, those short seasons never managed to produce anything of substance that would keep the company afloat. Everything in their repertoire after releasing Champloo consists of either failed experiments like Ergo Proxy (a show that I do like but consider far too obtuse for its own good) or unfinished adaptations like Deadman Wonderland and Karneval. The only adaptation they committed to was ""The World God Only Knows,"" and that\'s not necessarily a series that would appeal to a mainstream audience. Their final show was Gangsta, and while I\'ve never watched it, a cursory glance at reviews posted on websites like MAL or Hummingbird reveals that it suffers from many of the same problems that plagued Deadman Wonderland and Karneval. It\'s quite a shame too given how Manglobe always had an eye for creating stylistic shows that manage to leave some impact on the minds of their viewers.Karneval might not be Manglobe\'s best work, nor would I consider it to be a definitive ""must watch,"" but it\'s still a fun show that brings some unique ideas to the table with lacking, yet serviceable execution. If you\'re perfectly comfortable with watching this show knowing that it\'s a glorified manga trailer, you\'ll enjoy the hell out of it. If you\'re curious about what the manga is like, you\'ll get a good idea of what the manga\'s like and then find out whether or not you want to read it. If you\'re looking for a show that\'s a paragon of quality, look elsewhere. Either way, let\'s hope that Twin Engine and Geno Studio have better luck than Manglobe did. Attack on Titan continuation, there\'s a Deadman Wonderland or No Game No Life condemned to a life of obscurity. It doesn\'t matter if these shows are accessible outside of Japan either, because the executives who run these studios only care about their bottom line. But what happens if a studio goes bankrupt before establishing a bottom line of any sort? My friends, today we\'re going to be talking about the tragedy of Karneval and by extension, the inevitable collapse of Manglobe.Karneval is a show about a thief named Gareki and a mysterious boy named Nai. Both of them got roped into an organisation called Circus that investigates and exorcises creatures called Varuga; superhuman abominations that feed upon complex organisms like humans. These creatures are the result of experimentation by an organisation called Kafuka, whose goal is to spearhead human evolution. That\'s as best a summary as I can come up with, given how little the show tells us. Karneval as a show has so many ideas, concepts, and plot points that it wants to introduce. Unfortunately, that short season doesn\'t allow for these things to be fully fleshed out. Considering how the manga is approaching the 140-chapter mark at the time of writing, this only spells out a complete recipe for disaster. Then again, that\'s probably not an entirely fair assessment to make. The show itself does try to elucidate us on its inner workings; Manglobe did succeed in some regard, but they didn\'t quite hit a home run, so-to-speak.Had this show been a proper 24-episode season, I\'m sure we would\'ve had more shown to us. Unfortunately, that\'s not the finished product that aired on TV. Instead, we have a foundation for a story to be built upon rather than a narrative proper. That sad fact\'s reflected in the ending as it implied more is yet to come. Considering how it\'s been a little over seven years since Karneval ended and how Manglobe went bankrupt in 2015, it\'s unlikely we\'ll ever get more. Enough bellyaching about its flaws though, because there\'s still merit found in what we have. While the story\'s atrophied in terms of depth and detail, Manglobe provided us with sufficient context for the premise. If a prospective viewer intends to watch this show purely for entertainment without analysis, they wouldn\'t have much trouble doing so. We never find out much about the backstories of Circus agents like Yogi and Tsukumo, but there\'s plenty of context surrounding Gareki and Nai to provide some rudimentary picture of their origins. What\'s more, the bits of the story elucidated to the audience provided a framework for later events to follow during the show\'s run.Speaking of which, the Circus agents we\'re introduced to might not have much in the way of backstory. Even so, that still doesn\'t stop them from having fleshed out personalities, motivations, and investments. We know that the stress of the job presumably takes its toll on Yogi; that\'s why he\'s so dedicated to making the people around him smile. We never learn anything about Tsukumo\'s past, but her sensibilities on the battlefield and her compassionate demeanour make her a crucial ally. We know even less about the First Ship agents and their dynamics, but mutual respect and rivalry between both teams are readily apparent. Perhaps I may be looking too deep for merit, but these are details are so insignificant that other studios opt to neglect them entirely. The fact that Manglobe went through the trouble to even flesh them out, even partially, shows that there was someone on the writing staff who cared about it.On the subject of the premise, it\'s admittedly cliche on some level. However, I\'d argue that it\'s different enough to make this show unique. Unlike other animes like Bleach, D.Gray-man, and Black Butler, Karneval\'s not quite a supernatural series. The Varuga are indeed superhuman, and their deaths throughout the show come across as if they\'re exorcisms. However, they\'re explicitly monstrous aberrations of humanity and not some paranormal force. Their transformation can happen one of two ways: contact with tainted blood or through the use of drugs that spark these changes. Circus agents can fly, have superhuman powers of their own, and can conjure weapons whenever they please. However, these powers come from a treatment which alters their cellular makeup. Karneval may look like some flashy supernatural action flick, but it\'s far closer to sci-fi than anything else. Think SOLDIER from Final Fantasy VII instead of the Black Order from D.Gray-man.Moving away from the story and characters (or lack thereof), let\'s talk about the superficial aspects of this show. Before going bankrupt, Manglobe was renowned for giving each anime they worked on a distinctive look. These were the guys who created shows like Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, after all. Karneval is no exception, as the general aesthetic of the show blends elements of both shonen and shojo anime. That fact isn\'t too surprising though when you find out that Karneval is a josei manga. Gareki looks like any edgy shonen protagonist, but some of the other characters have those distinctive shojo manga eyes with the gangly proportions to boot. This fact is most apparent with Nai, as he looks like Kaworu Nagisa if he were the uke this time around.As for the designs of the Varuga, they\'re all quite varied in appearance and capability. From what I\'ve seen during the show\'s run, some Varuga can hide their monstrous form while being able to pass for normal humans. Those monstrous forms aren\'t necessarily the stuff of nightmares, but their transformations can spook a viewer who isn\'t ready for it. At least, that\'s what I try to tell myself because that first Varuga in the pilot episode scared the hell out of me when she started transforming. Subsequent transformations didn\'t catch me off guard, but first impressions tend to stick with you. I certainly can\'t fault Karneval for having original monster designs.The animation quality throughout the show is spectacular, but that\'s no surprise given Manglobe\'s reputation. Action scenes are fluid and enthralling to watch, especially by the show\'s end. Manglobe also spared no expense the stupider antics involving the gag comedy or the festival performances. Sometimes the jokes fell flat on me, but they were still lovely to look at regardless. While my formerly keen eye for animation errors has admittedly diminished, I couldn\'t personally make out any glaring animation errors throughout the show\'s run. I wouldn\'t necessarily call this show Manglobe\'s best from a stylistic or animation standpoint, but it\'s still quite a cut above average.The audio side of things is also quite lovely.

I was sad that the art didn\'t continue very much into the actual show further than the costuming of the circus agents.  The overall feel felt like a brighter version of D.Gray Man.  The story was interesting but could have used a little more thought and the characters were decent, (despite Nai\'s lack of a back bone driving me nuts) but the downfall was the work put into the dub.  I cringed every time the main cast entered the...scene due to the poor casting of Nai and Gareki who both sounded forced and either below or above the actors\' comfortable vocal range.  The script writing for the dub at first sounded like they were trying to be off-beat and interesting but eventually just looked lazy.  The maturity of language was inconsistent, ranging from Gareki saying b**** every other word one minute to awkward childish censorship the next.  Lines like ""Come on Buckaroo let\'s kick some tail!"" or ""Allergies, my left foot!"" or just the general use of the word ""whatevs,"" became more and more distracting and irritating as the show wore on.  All things considered it was average and worth a watch (maybe not a rewatch) and I hope a second season is in the wings, however, I won\'t be waiting on the edge of my seat. scene due to the poor casting of Nai and Gareki who both sounded forced and either below or above the actors\' comfortable vocal range.

I just had to write one now. Please note that this is my first review, so please bear with me.Story: 10/10Without giving too much away, Karneval is about a young boy, Nai, who is looking for someone who was important to him—in doing so, he gets himself captured. Gareki, a thief, finds him during a robbery and decides to rescue him. Then a series of events occur, blablabla, and they meet a defense organization known by the name Circus.I found the plot very original and interesting. Let...me just say now that nearly every episode ended with a cliffhanger. A lot of people don't like cliffhangers, I know, but I personally love them. The point is to make you want to keep watching, right? Karneval certainly does the job with that. There are twists at every turn and I found myself rushing to the next episode. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.Art: 10/10The artwork and animation in this anime is simply beautiful. It's lovely. Amazing. Breathtaking. I need better words. Hang on, let me grab a dictionary...just kidding. But honestly, this is some of the best art I've ever seen in an anime. The character designs are very nice, the backgrounds always catch my eye, and the art in the OP especially was very enjoyable. I don't know what else to say about this other than it's fantastic.Sound: 9/10The music is also very good. I loved the OP. The ending didn't interest me as much, but that was okay. The soundtrack didn't stand out too much, but it did its job and added emotion to every scene. I approved of every voice actor—they fit the characters well. Nai's came off as innocent like he was supposed to, Gareki's had the edge it needed, Togi's was humorous, etcetera.Characters: 10/10This is one of the only animes I've watched where I love almost every single character. You watch how they are in the beginning, and then you watch them grow and change. You get a chance to see every side and emotion to them, which is huge. Not a lot of animes do that. I absolutely adore Nai—he's the sweetest and most honest little guy ever! I can't stand seeing him sad. Oh my gosh, I just want to hug him. Gareki is rough around the edges, but inside, he's a really caring person. Togi is absolutely hilarious; very lovable. I could go into detail, but I'd be giving spoilers. Basically, I just feel like I really know the characters. They really grow on you.Enjoyment: 10/10I wish I could rate this 1000000/10. Karneval is unmatched as my favorite anime. The combination of the incredible characters, the beautiful art, and the intense plot makes it impossible not to love. At first, I had my doubts about it (especially since you're kind of thrown into everything in the very beginning and you have no clue what's going on...but don't worry—all your initial questions will be answered), but this definitely proved worth the while.Overall: 10/10I highly, highly, highly recommend Karneval to anyone!

The intricacy of the details and the unique appearances...so, very confused by the lack of information on the plot, I began Karneval, expecting a lot of beautiful characters and an equally wonderful story. However, I have to say that Karneval is one of those animes that begins with a great premise and then fails to fulfill the expectations that it builds.Story :: 6Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the story. It started out interesting, albeit not that unique, and became even more fascinating when Circus showed up on the scene. As the...multiple plot lines began to build, I became excited to see a climax, a resolution, how the entire mess would turn out. The problem is, there isn't a resolution. Karneval just keeps getting more and more confusing until there's no possible way out. The last episode served a mediocre ending, and, for me, created even more issues.Art :: 9To reiterate, the artwork is what attracted me to Karneval. I think this anime is one of the best I've seen in terms of artwork. It did get a little too sparkly at times for my taste, but just take a look at it on Google Images, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. The character designs are incredibly richly detailed and everyone has such a unique design that there's no way that you could get confused between the characters. The animation itself does fall down a few times, but overall I was so entranced by the designs of the characters that animation errors didn't bother me that much.Sound :: 6Other than the ED, in my opinion, the music doesn't stand out. The OP is very fitting for the series, however.Character :: 7The characters each had attractive, individual personalities, but they really needed a lot more development. I feel as though the anime only scratched the surface of their true personalities. A little bit of background on the characters, maybe a few flashbacks, might have been helpful to the plot as well. Some of the characters received such inadequate development that I knew barely anything about them when the series ended, even if they were characters that were central to the plot, such as Karoku and Akari.Enjoyment :: 6Looking back on it now, I think the only thing that kept me attracted to the anime was the artwork [ and the constant desire to listen to the ED song ]. It could have been so much better. A season 2 where the plot is developed would be a great help to this anime, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though there's one planned.Overall :: 6It was alright. Karneval doesn't stand out for anything besides the art. I didn't dislike it at any point, but there were a lot of errors and plot holes that could have been ameliorated in some way. I wanted to like this, but I couldn't. multiple plot lines began to build, I became excited to see a climax, a resolution, how the entire mess would turn out. The problem is, there isn't a resolution. Karneval just keeps getting more and more confusing until there's no possible way out. The last episode served a mediocre ending, and, for me, created even more issues.Art :: 9To reiterate, the artwork is what attracted me to Karneval. I think this anime is one of the best I've seen in terms of artwork. It did get a little too sparkly at times for my taste, but just take a look at it on Google Images, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

I wanted to like this, but I couldn't."", ""After watching this anime, I can surely say that it is by far one of my favourites yet. This is one of the very few that I've enjoyed almost every, if not every single episode to the point that I had to absolutely binge it. I kept on putting myself off of the anime as I've been wanting to watch it for about a year or so, and I don't regret watching it at all... I kind of regret waiting this long, aha. Ironically, the reason that I decided to finally watch it was because I was looking for new inspiration to glisten up my...account, and straight after the first episode, I loved it to pieces.Story: 8/10While the story may be confusing for some, I do admit that it can be, but to be fair, you have to have a very high- *coughs*...sorry.As confusing as the story may be, the depth that the anime goes into basically blinds the confusion and treats the manga well.In the first minute of the first episode, you'll already question what you just discovered, but it'll sure get you hooked once you realise what happens.The amount of depth that gets put into characters to develop their own or others' persona is quite unique, and it always has a way to make it feel fresh and new: to make you feel happy or sad.The plot can simply be put into 5 words: Nai wants to find Karoku. But of course, it's much more complicated than that. Throughout the anime, new characters get introduced to develop mixed emotions towards the watcher and help the characters to grow in the present and to help us understand their past.Art: 10/10I'm not really that appealed into art styles as I focus on everything else and my own personal enjoyment, but there are always some things that make me cherish that specific art style. Detail.By detail, I mean what makes the character look unique: accessories, outfits, hairstyle, body language... and the eyes.Eyes are the main factor when it comes to anime because of the emotions expressed through them and how diverse they can be. For example, I love Ciel's dark blue eyes due to how perfectly shaped they are with those appealing bottom eyelashes; Karneval is no exception. The mixture of colours used with the eyes is mesmerising.The outfits are absolutely beautiful and creative to the point that the outfits themselves serve as a substitute for the entire meals in Food Wars. I'm not even kidding. The outfits, especially Nai's, give me the same satisfaction of wanting to wear them. They are so diverse and are colour-coded absolutely perfectly, alongside the similarity of the eye and hair colour of many characters such as Karoku and Yogi to compliment the designs even further.Sound: 9/10To begin with, the mandala in the OP is beautiful and so are the rectangular lights that scatter across the screen behind the pretty animated characters. I really like how the song is rock as I'm quite a fan of that. It's a really catchy song once you've listened to it a couple of times. Plus, it's Granrodeo so what's not to love?The ED is so colourful and bright that it sometimes doesn't even match with the ending of a few episodes, but regardless the song is calming and mesmeric.Character: 9/10I was very meticulous when it came to the characters, and they sure did something perfectly. Each character feels human, even the side characters that only get mentioned for a couple of episodes develop some sort of backstory for the main characters and bring sympathy to us watchers, such as the two twins developing Gareki's backstory even further. The small hints of Nai's abilities and persona really bring him out as a character that actually acts how they actually are to the point that it's smart yet absolutely adorable. With each character having some form of social weakness and a unique personality, plus the backstory of the characters and their reasoning, you could really make them feel special.Enjoyment: 10/10With some subtle areas of comedy and pureness, I just couldn't resist Nai. In every episode, I'd laugh at even the most minor things just because of how certain people reacted, such as Gareki talking all unenthusiastically in bright moments. And not to forget how cute Nai looks, I mean, just look at him.I absolutely loved the plot, characters, and ideas. Almost everything unanswered was eventually answered throughout the anime. Every episode was a rollercoaster whether it be of joy, melancholy, or pure excitement.The only thing that disappointed me was the cliffhanger at the end with the Karoku theory, but I swear that must continue with a sequel.Since the manga is still ongoing I'll read that while hoping for a second season. I'd rewatch it anytime without a doubt.Overall: 8/10 account, and straight after the first episode, I loved it to pieces.Story: 8/10While the story may be confusing for some, I do admit that it can be, but to be fair, you have to have a very high- *coughs*...sorry.As confusing as the story may be, the depth that the anime goes into basically blinds the confusion and treats the manga well.In the first minute of the first episode, you'll already question what you just discovered, but it'll sure get you hooked once you realise what happens.The amount of depth that gets put into characters to develop their own or others' persona is quite unique, and it always has a way to make it feel fresh and new: to make you feel happy or sad.The plot can simply be put into 5 words: Nai wants to find Karoku.

The pacing was done well, but even though it was only a 13 episode anime, I personally feel that it wrapped up quite nicely. Even though you are still stuck with the question of ""What happened to Uro? What about Palned?"", the future for characters like Gareki are shown, and thus end the anime without too many loose ends. I liked the story line, and the humor they put in every once in a while was enjoyable. The main characters, Nai,...Gareki, Yogi, and Tsukumo, spent a lot of time in the hospital, though. But when they go out on a mission, something very entertaining always happens.The art was amazing. It was really colorful without being gaudy. The animation was fluid and not bothersome to watch at all. The way the characters were drawn, from the eyes to their outfits was outstanding. Even extra characters, like the nurses and children, were drawn meticulously and looked great. The way the Varuga were drawn was done very well. The fact that they are colored black makes it obvious when someone or something is a Varuga and it is a nice contrast to the constant colors.The music and voices in this anime are on-point. The opening is Henai no Rondo by GRANRODEO, who also sang many openings for Kuroko\'s Basketball. The graphics are great in the opening. They immediately show all the characters, and show the relationship between Gareki and Nai. It was timed well and after they show the characters, they all get 2-4 seconds to show their abilities. The ending was nice, because it was a little Niji (you\'ll learn about them in the anime) running up as all the characters that showed up, even in only 2 episodes, are slowly scrolled down. It is a very pleasant song called Reason by KAmiYU. The soundtrack was great. I liked listening to it and some of the songs consisted of a piano or some string instruments. It did a good job of setting the mood and it was enjoyable to listen to it. The voices were on point. Gareki, being the cold person he was, was played by Hiroshi Kamiya (Noragami: Yato, Durarara: Izaya Orihara). Nai was played by Hiro Shimono (Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai: Katsuragi Keima) and had an innocent tone to his voice. Yogi was played by Mamoru Miyano (Death Note: Yagami Light) and he brought Yogi\'s character to life. Tsukumo was played by Aya Endou (Lucky Star: Miyuki Takara) and portrayed Tsukumo\'s character as a Kuudere very well.The characters were very interesting. The design for each of them was unique and different. However, with so many characters, some of them were not developed as much as one may like. The character development for Gareki was done well as Gareki went from a cold person who thought of people as enemy, prey, or nothing, to someone who cared about his friends in Circus. Nai\'s soul became stronger while he was still kind to people around him, easily considering one he just met a friend. Yogi went through a sudden transformation in one of the episodes, resulting in a deeper character than one may think. Tsukumo became more social and more friendly towards people on the Second Ship.I really enjoyed this anime. It is one of my favourites. I was first attracted to it by its art style, and I really enjoyed watching the characters go through many ordeals with the Varuga. I don\'t have a favourite character (because I love so many of them) but I do have a least favourite. The action scenes were well paced, and the animation was top notch. The story was interesting and had a small but shocking plot twist at the end, and the soundtrack was one of the nicest one person can hear, in my opinion.

So what went wrong?From the beginning, it became apparent that this show\'s most appealing and irresistible factor was the eye candy, but it seemed like there could be something more. The first two episodes were promising and seemed to set up the right amount of quirky mysteries to make this anime intriguing and addicting. The problem, however, was that instead of slowly resolving these so-called mysteries, the writers just kept adding in more and more with every episode. As a result, way too...many questions were being asked and, sadly, no one bothered to answer them. As in, ever. Not even in the last episode. Or in another season. Just, no.And that\'s what made this show so utterly disappointing. The fact that it had pretty much everything, and, in the end, it had nothing. Since not even the slightest of attempts was made to resolve a single one of the mysteries or answer a single one of the questions being asked even at the end of this show (I mean, the bad guys literally just run away without saying anything), it made everything else that happened up to that point feel empty, pointless, and a complete waste of potential (and huge one, at that).Consequently, I was left guessing not only as to what happened with Nai and all the other characters before and after this show, but even as to why this show was made in the first place. I mean, why bother with pretty art and animation and fantastic voice acting and music (as well as a setup for an interesting plot), if you\'re not going to take it anywhere and just let everything and everyone fall flat on their faces?These are the questions I still ask myself to this day. By leaving such a bitter taste in my mouth, Karneval made me feel... well, hardly anything. It wasn\'t terrible enough for me to hate it and it wasn\'t great enough for me to love it either. In a nutshell, it was just another anime that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.Although I wouldn\'t say I absolutely didn\'t enjoy watching this series, I also wouldn\'t really call it ""enjoyable"". If you love watching eye candy (even if you can\'t really taste it or feel it) and are willing to sit through a plot-hole-ridden, unresolved, magical adventure just for the sake of watching pretty characters wear pretty clothes and put on pretty circus shows, then this is the anime for you. If you\'re looking for a more rewarding, fulfilling experience, then definitely skip it and save yourself the disappointment. many questions were being asked and, sadly, no one bothered to answer them.

If you\'re looking for a more rewarding, fulfilling experience, then definitely skip it and save yourself the disappointment.', 'A logical first impression when someone hears about “Karneval” and looks at the Cover Art:•\t“Wow, Karneval! That’s a really cute name! And look at the cover art! It looks like a party! Look at the main character! He looks so cute! This is going to be a totally cute and not-violent anime with lots of fun and partying!”That same person’s impression after they watch the first episode:•\t“Wh-What? Rape? Huh? Where are the parties? Why is everything so creepy? Why is there a serious, black-haired, yet crazy handsome kid holding a gun? What is that monster, why is it very graphically eating that man?! Ah!...Confliction!”Needless to say, this anime is not what you think it is. If you want a cute little shoujo party anime, go to Shugo Chara. This anime gives off the impression of being cute, then you watch the first episode and you’re conflicted on whether or not you want to continue to support that first impression. I mean, there are SOME cute party scenes that last for a few seconds, but there’s a really dark thought behind these parties and it really has a darker plotline than one would expect. I’m glad that I was surprised, actually. I think that having a darker plotline underneath the cute expectation really worked for it and added a bunch of refreshing juxtaposed elements. This anime really isn’t for everybody, though.Plot: 5It’s an interesting plot: The story focuses on 2 boys. Gareki is a young, Lady-killing thief who steals money because he wants to (Insert Spoiler Here). He is really great with technology and has a hand for shooting. One day while he was robbing this rich house, he runs into Nai, our second protagonist. Nai is a really young boy, around 8, who claims to have no memory except for this one man named Karoku, who he claims was his caretaker, now missing. All he has left of Karoku now is a bracelet that is later identified as an identification band for a government sponsored combat organization that goes by the name of “Circus.” Somehow, both Gareki and Nai end up travelling together after almost being captured and killed by a monster. This monster is apparently one of the main targets of Circus and that leads to both Nai and Gareki getting held in custody of Circus for questioning and interrogation.The anime revolves around their adventures with the people they meet and the events that happen while they are tied up with Circus, who are using them to help unlock the mystery of these monsters. The plot is a very fun idea and there are a lot of cute friendship themes that pop up often. I’m sorry to say this, because it was only a 13 episode anime, but everything seemed kind of rushed and there were a lot of scenes where nothing made any sense, eventually leading to an ending that just screwed with my entire mindset. There are a lot of holes in the anime; we never find out what happens to Karoku and the mystery behind the bracelet. The main goals of the characters are supposed to be what makes up the plot of this anime, but it fails in developing that and instead focuses on the development of the bonds b/w characters. It didn’t make for a BAD anime, but it kind of left me unsatisfied in the end with a lot of questions still unanswered. Also, a lot of elements and somewhat significant plot elements seemed to be added last minute and explained with only 2 minutes left to go in the last episode of the anime. I guess I would be satisfied if there was another OV that aired to follow up on the unanswered questions, but there wasn’t and in the end, everything ended up making fuck-all sense. I’m very disappointed because I was really anxious; I knew this plot had potential, but it just wasn’t put together well in the end.Sound: 7The music was, at best, mediocre. I wasn’t impressed with the opening or the OST, but there were times where the anime surprised me when pulling out a pretty solo during an emotional moment, which was satisfying. The ending was quite pretty and one of my favorite track in this anime. The voice acting was also good, but really, when isn’t it?Art: 9I have to say for myself, the art for this anime was really beautiful. From the designs of the characters to the settings for the anime and the beautiful exchanges b/w the characters, everything was really pretty. The character designs were definitely my favorite part, though. The eyes of the characters were really colorful and each design was 10x different than the next. The designs also fit the characters’ personalities very well. Nai was so fricking adorable and Gareki was really coolly designed. Everything that was supposed to be dark was dark; everything that was supposed to be fun was fun. I loved the contrast within the art styles too. The color and darkness was really interesting to look at. The only thing is, if you knew me at all, you’d know that I’m a sucker for good fight scenes in a shounen. This anime didn’t have the fight scenes that I longed for. They were just mediocre, and for that, I dock a point.Characters: 8The characters were my favorite part of this anime. I fell in love with a lot of them, I grew to hate a lot of them. Some characters were amazingly likeable, like Nai. Nai was a fricking angel and his innocence conflicted the darkness and seriousness that was supposed to surround this anime. Sometimes, when done right, a child’s innocent nature can really change the whole mood of the anime. Karneval did that really well. His design was adorable; his diction and attitude was even 10x more likeable, and that’s why I grew to like him. He contrasted with Gareki’s serious nature and that really helped with the whole reoccurring friendship thing. Opposites really do attract. Another character I really grew to love was Yogi. He was like an adult child and I loved it. He was a well-designed, well thought out comic relief that really relieved stress off of the constant depression that hitting me, wave after wave, in this anime. Those three characters were designed in genius. The one thing I didn’t like is that there were WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS!!! I never learned all of their names. You know that when a watcher can’t learn all of the names, you added too many characters to count. Many of them added absolutely nothing to the anime. No comic relief, no added action, some of them sucked at fighting, it was ridiculous. There was very little character development in some serious protagonists, and even the antagonists had fuck all development. I never learned what happened to them! I never learned their secrets or their true intentions! That’s not good.Enjoyment: 7Okay, I’m not lying when I say I like this anime. Sure, it was cute and fun to watch. I liked the episodes that didn’t take themselves seriously; that was the show’s strong point. The episodes where there was actually supposed to be “plot development” died. Many of them bored me and I longed for more “unseriousness.” I get that they were trying, but their attempts were unsuccessful. The plot was developed horribly, what else can I say? The development of relationships and connections were done really well though and that was what I enjoyed.Overall: 7 Confliction!”Needless to say, this anime is not what you think it is.

Nai was a fricking angel and his innocence conflicted the darkness and seriousness that was supposed to surround this anime. Sometimes, when done right, a child’s innocent nature can really change the whole mood of the anime. Karneval did that really well. His design was adorable; his diction and attitude was even 10x more likeable, and that’s why I grew to like him. He contrasted with Gareki’s serious nature and that really helped with the whole reoccurring friendship thing. Opposites really do attract. Another character I really grew to love was Yogi. He was like an adult child and I loved it. He was a well-designed, well thought out comic relief that really relieved stress off of the constant depression that hitting me, wave after wave, in this anime. Those three characters were designed in genius. The one thing I didn’t like is that there were WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS!!! I never learned all of their names. You know that when a watcher can’t learn all of the names, you added too many characters to count. Many of them added absolutely nothing to the anime. No comic relief, no added action, some of them sucked at fighting, it was ridiculous. There was very little character development in some serious protagonists, and even the antagonists had fuck all development. I never learned what happened to them! I never learned their secrets or their true intentions! That’s not good.Enjoyment: 7Okay, I’m not lying when I say I like this anime. Sure, it was cute and fun to watch. I liked the episodes that didn’t take themselves seriously; that was the show’s strong point. The episodes where there was actually supposed to be “plot development” died. Many of them bored me and I longed for more “unseriousness.” I get that they were trying, but their attempts were unsuccessful. The plot was developed horribly, what else can I say? The development of relationships and connections were done really well though and that was what I enjoyed.Overall: 7', ""First of all, this anime isn't for everyone. It took me 2 months to finish just 13 episodes. I started it and it was interesting but then got really boring so i couldn't bring myself to watch any more, but started again today and was really captivated. I WANT MORE EPISODES.The art is amazing, I'm inlove with Gareki and Hirato.The opening and ending songs got me singing with them.There's no real story. Just a boy that is looking for his friend. And you know the rest, people help out and blah.oh, add in some random crap about Varuga (demon thingy's) and a animal turned...human, with circus themed everything. You got Karneval.The anime does have some really funny moments and some absolutely heart-wrenching ones.If there's a season 2, I'll watch it.Overall, I enjoyed it. human, with circus themed everything.

I've read reviews about it and most of it said it would just be a typical anime show with a boy who is a bit weak to stand on his own eventually meets a guy who's stronger and they become friends and all. THAT! Would be a Yes at first.I gave it a 10 because it didn't turn out to be the TYPICAL anime show I was expecting it to be. It started with Nai, a helpless and innocent  boy looking for someone, who accidentally...meets  Gareki, a mysterious wandering guy with a gun who wants nothing but money.

I don't want to spoil anything so let's stop there :D I would say the beginning of the story is your usual type of story but after that, it's all bizarre. Turns out, Karneval is full of mysteries, and the mysteries don't get revealed overnight. This ain't a detective story or what, it's all about Nai, which makes Nai and his identity, a mystery as well.

It looked like it needed another season to respectably wrap up its main plot.', 'The task or purpose of a circus is to keep the audience entertained throughout the show they deliver; sparkling lights, well costumed actors and cute, yet dangerous animals are either helpful and seek your attention. None would dare to blink more than absolutely necessary. Once you leave, it is the greatest reward for a circus if you would not forget what you just have experienced. A reward which Karneval struggles to achieve.The anime opens with two of the main character, Nai and Gareki. Nai - a simple minded boy who clearly cannot survive in such a harsh world – is looking for a guy...named Karoku. His search brings him in contact with Gareki, a young pickpocket guy who has nowhere to go. After seeing Nais priceless bracelet that would bring Gareki certainly the so much needed money, they end up on the run and encounter a battle between the supernatural Government defense force known as Circus and a evil supernatural organization named Kafka that develops these demonic creatures called Varugas. Both, Gareki and Nai would soon be caught in the hunt as the mysterious organizations seems to have a deep interest in each of them – and especially since Nai is not as human as he appears.Karneval has rather modest ambitions, and accordingly, it packs only a modest emotional punch in terms of story and character development; it is mainly about pretty guys – in roles big and small - in pretty, yet fancy outfits and the characters leave a lot to be desired.Talking of which, this leads us the first issue: the characters. The main characters (Garki, Nai, Yogi and Tsukumo) are attractive and each of them is individual; however, there is still room for development. Gareki is a guy who does not like getting close to people but actually cares for them deeply whereas Yogi is a rather childish guy who wants to get along well with everyone. Nai is the innocent and cute guy, but as the story progresses – which it hardly does - he becomes more and more a background character. And last but not least, there is Tsukumo, a fighting, yet calm girl who – after the anime introduces her – is not as interesting as we might have expected her to be. In conclusion: out of the main cast, Gareki is the only one who receives a proper background which is why he seems to be the most interesting of the cast.There are some other pretty faces stumbling through this show but due to the lack of depth and further explanations, we cannot help but to realize that we do not care for the characters at all; yet, they serve the anime as the ordinary, stereotypical supporting characters.On the other hand, there are several issues with the story. The anime has two plot points: one is about the rather lukewarm relationship of Gareki and Nai whereas the other is all about the mysterious organization called Circus.The story of Gareki and Nai is more a personal journey; Nai seems to love Karoku -. a mysterious young man who does have screen appearances but the viewer has little to no clue to his true origin or identity; which is why Nais own identity is mostly unclear throughout the series - but apparently grows very fond of Gareki as well. And Gareki slowly changes whenever he hangs out with Nai. And even though this plot takes up a lot of the series running time, there can barely be seen any progression at the end of the show.The second plot about Circus is mostly a puzzle throughout the series; at first glance, this plot appears to be generally just about certain missions the members of Circus tackle that Nai and Garkei tags along to. In fact, however, it is about their pursuit of the organization called Kafka. Circus is actually trying to find suitable evidence of crime since Kafka is responsible for creating monsters called Varuga. These monsters were once humans that got their cells altered. As a result, they became rather deformed super humans that hurt innocent people. The issue in this plot is the lack of explanations. They are an organization - involving some pretty faces - and that is nearly it. Therefore, the manga gives you unquestionably better explanations.As a matter of fact, it is saddening to see that the anime lets you down even though it has such a stunning animation. The character designs are all gloriously done; the world looks as if it wants to be explored and the studio added so many little, yet seemingly unimportant background details which really highlights the series strength.Additionally, editing and cutting are well-directed too which is sort of the pounding heart of the show.The opening song is definitely a good start into the show, whereas the rest of the soundtrack appears rather decent: in other words, it is only noticeable during tense moments. It has its moments when it shines out brighter than expected but all in all there are numerous of far better soundtracks out there.As mentioned in the opening, the series struggles to achieve any notable reward. The concept might have been promising but failed to keep you breathless in the seat - while the show is running - until the curtain falls for the last time.

We meet the main character, ""Nai"", who by first glance isn\'t nothing special. His name literally means, \'Nothing\'. By chance he meets Gareki, your typical \'bad-boy I don\'t need anyone\' type of character. Those are our main characters we will be following throughout the series.Story: 8/10Nai is looking for someone special to him, Karoku, with only a bracelet as a clue. At the beginning of the first episode we find him in a difficult predicament, in which...he meets Gareki. How did he get there? We will never know, and it will never be explained. Being of the mystery genre, there are some things that will obviously leave you clueless but there are some things that this anime can leave in blank. They meet the secret (yet flashy) organization ""Circus"", who fight against the organization ""Kafka"" and the monsters called ""Varuga"". These monsters are often mentioned in the series but we never go in depth with them.So overall the plot is very interesting and enticing, but the anime left more than a few things to be asked for.Art: 9/10The animation for this series was very beautiful and well made. The colors they used were very soft, and for the most mysterious character they weren\'t so solemn or anyting of the sort. The animation was very smooth, taking well the flips, the turns, the explosions and the other movements. The drawing was very \'cute\', what with Nai being your typical big eyed feminine meek character and Tsukumo your beautiful limber acrobat. The characters were distinguishable and I had no hard time in differentiating them. The only downside were some animation mistakes but those can be looked upon on and are hardly noticable.Sound: 9/10The opening was rock, with some \'carneval\' touches. As a fan of GRANRODEO, it was good but not their best. But it was appropriate for the anime. The ending was a pop/catchy tune, and it caught me singing it every time I heard it. The soundtracks stuck to the moment, with the fighting scenes and the sad parts, but they weren\'t very noticable. The voice acting was fine, the seiyuus stuck to the character\'s personality and I had no problems with this.Character: 8/9There many characters in Karneval, all with a beautiful character design and their own personality. The main character Nai is extremely innocent and pure, knowing nothing from the real world, as he couldn\'t even distinguish blood. But once you find out what he really is, it\'s quite understandable. Gareki was probably one of the only characters we got a somewhat full backstory, explaining his attitude and why he does what he does. The supporting characters, the members of Circus, look like some of the most interesting but with no development at all. We get subtle hints of Yogi and Tsukumo, but nothing on their backstory. Including with Captain Hirato and the other members of Circus. There are also some members of Kafka mentioned in the series, but nothing explained on them whatsoever, and you will be scratching your head at the end with Karoku. But once again, it is understandable since you can only pack so much in 13 episodes.Enjoyment: 9/10Even if there were somethings that left me wondering with this anime, I enjoyed it. The character interaction was enjoyable and it reached it\'s cuteness factor and some humor.Overall: 8/10It was a nice anime, overall. It\'s great if you want to look at something cute and pretty while having some mystery and action at the same time. With so much left to ask for, it makes you want to search for more but there\'s the manga for that. It\'s an anime that needs focus and dedication, but if you can do that then I can assure you can enjoy its moments. he meets Gareki. How did he get there?

You will sure have fun!StoryWhat I liked the most about the story are the infinity possibilities the plot allows. It begins with Nai meeting Gareki and both of them getting involved with the Varuga and the organization which fights them -- the Circus --, and anything can happen from this moment on. The plot has a nice structure, with two main objectives presented in the beginning -- Nai wants to find Karoku; the Circus investigates the Varuga and think Nai can be useful for them --, a...middle in which everyone tries to reach their objectives, and a conclusion at the end. As the manga isn\'t finished, there are still some threads dangling at the end, but they managed to show us a conclusion for the main objectives, even if partially and with new questions coming from that. It is an ""open end"" which calls for a continuation, but still feels like it had an end.CharactersI must say I hate yaoi and Nai\'s uke appearance annoyed me at the beginning. But when I started thinking of him as a cute fantasy creature, I ended up laughing at some scenes that became cute (yes, just like Gareki did!). Now I actually like him a lot. He is a pure-hearted boy searching for Karoku, a misterious guy who is important to him.Gareki, on the other hand, is a smart guy and a skilled shooter who distrusts people, but can actually be very gentle. It is easy to love his personality.There is also Yogi, with a childish personality which provides lots of funny scenes with the serious Gareki, and there is Tsukumo, the only girl in the main cast, who is very quiet.I wouldn\'t say they own very original personalities, but their past and the mystery behind them make them unique and interesting.VoicesA strong point of this anime. At first, I wasn\'t sure about Kamiya Hiroshi doing Gareki\'s role, but no one should ever doubt HiroC. He is a pro. He made an amazing job, and his voice fits Gareki perfectly!At the first episodes, I could feel Shimono Hiro was forcing his voice to sound younger than his usual characters, but he probably got used to it, so Nai\'s voice sounded much more natural in the second half of the anime. I feel glad it was Shimono-san, and not a girl doing Nai\'s voice.Miyano Mamoru got Yogi\'s role. Do I need to say more? It was not a surprise after all, as Mamo-chan is one of the best at voicing this kind of character. I can imagine him having a lot of fun during the recording.Endou Aya did a good job with Tsukumo\'s (few) lines. Also, Ono Daisuke was a nice choice for Hirato\'s role.MusicOpening theme by GRANRODEO. Personally, I think this band fits shounen anime better, but I\'m not complaining, because they are great and so is the song.Ending theme by KAmiYU. Just perfect. It has a happy and colorful melody which fits the anime. But do you know it is Gareki (HiroC) who sings that? It\'s funny if you see things this way.I will be honest and say I didn\'t pay much attention to the soundtrack, and it\'s not a bad thing. The soundtrack helped building the mood of each scene naturally, never deviating my attention or forcing feelings into me -- the sad scenes were actually sad and didn\'t need a sad music coming from nowhere to tell me how should I feel.ArtVery beautiful, with a nice character design and vivid colors.OverallWhat I liked the most about this anime is that it\'s mostly for girls, but has nice battles and is settled in a very interesting fantasy world.

How was Nai created? What happened to Uro? What was the bad guys plan? Who exactly was the antagonist? So many holes. Nai had absolutely no development he was still the same innocent, weak, dim witted child we met in the beginning. Most of the characters were interesting at first glance but that...was it they had no depth, they never seemed to have any conflict.

If you are looking for a series to just peak an interest this one is for you.', 'Karneval is a shojou anime, boarding on shonen-ai. It follows the adventures of Nai and Garaki and how they got involved with Circus, a secret organization which protects Japan from monsters.The story is kind of loose. It\'s mainly about Nai and how he is looking for Karoku, but also about Gareki and how he tries to make himself useful to everyone around him in circus. I say loose because they are not really actively searching for Karoku and a lot of the time they just seem to be roaming around without any real direction of what they are doing. For being an organization that is...supposed to take out monsters they don\'t really seem to care that much about doing their jobs.Karneval has two true main characters, Nai and Gareki. They are also really the only two characters that get any form of development. Nai is an young innocent boy who has super sensitive hearing (which is not really utilized) who is looking for his friend, Karoku. He runs into Gareki, a cold loner who just seems to be along for the ride (but the reasons why he stays is explained later). He is really the only good character in the show and it would have been a lot more enjoyable if more characters had such development. Nai himself is just annoying, yes, his personality fits his background and character twist (which is IMO incredibly dumb and you\'ll know why once you get to it), but I\'d rather have him be more engaging than more or less fit perfectly into his backstory.The other characters are mildly entertaining, but don\'t really get a lot of development. Yogi is probably the most ""main"" of the side characters, but is really just there for some comic relief. Tsukumo is really there for being the only female in the entire show.By far the worst thing in the entire show is the dialogue. Now, I watch this subbed like I\'m sure most of you do so maybe it\'s not really that bad, but I am surprised when a character makes a full sentence. Actually, I was not sure if Nai was even able to say more than Karoku and Gareki for a while. Also, Yogi seems to cry through half of his lines, which is not really dialogue, but his voice acting is bad even compared to the rest of this cast which I would say did not do a great job presenting their characters.If you really like looking at girly boys, that are not traps, then this is a show for you. The art is pretty good too, at least it has a pleasant style that seems to fit the show. However, if you want anything else, even some sort of romance then you are sorely out of luck. supposed to take out monsters they don\'t really seem to care that much about doing their jobs.Karneval has two true main characters, Nai and Gareki. They are also really the only two characters that get any form of development. Nai is an young innocent boy who has super sensitive hearing (which is not really utilized) who is looking for his friend, Karoku. He runs into Gareki, a cold loner who just seems to be along for the ride (but the reasons why he stays is explained later).

Within the first few minutes our other main character, Gareki, crashes through by seemingly complete coincidence to steal any valuables in the house. Gareki agrees to help Nai escape and find a man named Karoku, in...exchange for his strange and mysterious bracelet.From here the characters are somehow let to Circus, a government run organization in charge of controlling crime. Here we are introduced to many interesting characters.And here is where the series shines the most: the personalities of each character. Because there are so many characters, I will just focus on the 5 key characters.Nai is an adorable, childlike young boy. Although despite his innocence, he has an air of mystery about his existence and has some pretty key senses for not only hearing, but can easily tell the emotions of the people he is closest to. Although he may not always fully understand what is going on, he will jump at the chance to defend those he loves even though he probably knows that he would most likely lose in a fight.Gareki is our sort of ""tsundere"" character for the series, although in this case that really isn\'t a bad thing. In the first episode he is introduced an undisputed shoot now ask questions later badass. However, as the series progresses we begin to realize that this appearance is a facade. Most notably, he gets easily threatened by things that make him feel any emotions that may seen ""unmasculine"". This can lead to some interesting moments where he gets mad at Nai or Yogi, who can make him feel uncomfortable due to how open they often are with their feeling and actions. ALthough I do find the ""tsundere"" character to be way overused in this kind of anime, this actually works well in the show\'s favor. Gareki isn\'t just an emotionless jerk for the sake of being a jerk. There is a genuine reason why he fears allowing himself to show emotions and get attached to people. By the end of the series Gareki seems to be well on his way to letting go of his past and accepting his feelings towards his newfound family. However, this is where the series falters slightly. At only 12 episodes, Gareki\'s development feels a bit rushed in the last few episodes. It seems like there is just a sudden change from being completely inaccessible to softening up, with no real major moment that should have triggered this change. I\'ve never read the manga, so I\'m not sure if this is unique to the show or if it was a problem with the source material.And next we have Yogi. Yogi is the one who first brings Gareki and Nai to Circus. At first he may seem a little annoying, but as the series goes on he just might become your favorite character. Yogi is fun, energetic, and loves being around others. Basically, he is the polar opposite of Gareki which makes for some very entertaining interactions between the two. Although at first he seems whiny and clingy, you quickly learn that this is simply because the members of Circus are all he has, and as a result he fears losing them or not being liked by them. Together, the members of Airship Two form a sort of family. Yogi, in some ways, seems to be the center of this.(edit this later its late lol) exchange for his strange and mysterious bracelet.From here the characters are somehow let to Circus, a government run organization in charge of controlling crime.

I believe that the whole story was based in an interesting metaphor the metaphor being the ""Circus"" As it can be compared that the Varga are the animals that are needed to be tamed by the ""Circus"" and ""Kafhka"" This story has a good ending, and many plot twists unlike most anime this one answer the question ""HOW"" and ""WHY""1/How do they have super powers?2/Why are they like that?Were some of the questions that were answered absolutely clearly in this anime. There weren\'t any complicated mechanisms, even if they were complicated i have no doubt the anime explained it to us effectively.Art: It was because of the cover that I had the urge to watch the anime in the first place, thus the art was very admirable.The openings and endings were done creatively, everything was based on the ""Carnival"" atmosphere.I also appreciated that the Character clothing was changed respectively from time to time(which most anime does not do)Sound: The characters were voiced by the right Voice-actors, they did it superbly.The Soundtracks were good. There were some interesting pieces which played whenever Karoku was mentioned and another which had Slow Piano piece. The Openings and Endings were okay.Character: Since this is the circus people,they do get to do performances and their roles in the performances suits their personalities. Like Clown being Yogi and Hirato being the magician. Gareki himself is a different type of a Tsundere character, which i wanted to see in many anime but haven\'t seen except in this one. The girls are not weak, all of them can fight and i thought that was pretty cool. Usually the character emotions are displayed indirectly to the audience and there were some unexpected character outbursts.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this one, wanted more episodes. But just so you know, there aren\'t any news of a second season.Overall: I expected more from this, but i believe that if this anime had about 50 episodes max and a min of 24. it would have earned a lot from me. Also this one was creative and id worth watching. Friendships are the biggest highlight in this story, i guess many can call this Yaoi, but whatever it is it urges the audience to keep watching.

Really?Then ""Karneval"" might be an anime for you.Let me say that Karneval is not a masterpiece, it\'s not something that changes your view of life. Still, it\'s a rather nice series to watch on a boring afternoon. Maybe you\'ve watched animes like ""K"" or ""07-Ghost"", they both deliver an equal amount of fighting and fanservice.If you liked either of them, you\'ll probably like this one.But let\'s get to a more detailed description:Story 7/10While there is...a decent plot, you sometimes get the feeling that it\'s just too much at once. Karneval desperately tries to make its supernatural aspects seem logical, yet it kind of fails at that. The viewer is overwhelmed by the amount of information and confusing plot twists that simply shouldn\'t be put in a 13-episode-anime.Nevertheless, the story is original and the circus-theme is something you don\'t encounter that often.It\'s obvious that the author spent lots of time creating a smart plot and even though that wasn\'t a complete success, it\'s alright.Art 9/10As for the art, I personally think it was the best aspect of the show. The characters look very nice and detailed (everyone has his/her own hairstyle, eye shape, clothing style etc.), the surroundings are okay. What stands out are the well animated fighting scenes, the bright, happy atmosphere is able to turn into a dark battlefield with monsters and bloodshed - and it works out.Sound 7/10I really like the OP as it suits the show. Perfectly fitting seiyuus (especially for the main characters ) that did a great job are nothing to complain about, either. So why ""only"" 7 points? Well, there\'s just honestly not much else to praise when it comes to the sound. Nothing outstanding. But let\'s be honest, there are few animes with a truly great soundtrack, so this is forgivable.Characters 6/10The characters. Duh. Wouldn\'t even be half as bad, yet, there are just so freaking /many/ of them. It feels like they randomly introduced tons of new characters in every single episode just because the author felt like including every single kind of bishie she could think of. This makes Karneval unnecessarily confusing - who likes/hates who? Wait, who the hell is this guy? Why would he --When it comes to the protagonists, they are quite likeable and even show kind of a character development throughout the show. We even get to know parts of their backstories. Unfortunately they don\'t get the amount of attention they deserve because Karneval is busier introducing new ones.Enjoyment 7/10When I watch airing animes, some make me eagerly wait for the next episode the second I finish watching the last one, watching them within an hour after their release and desperately updating the stream site.Karneval wasn\'t one of them. It\'s something I watched when there wasn\'t anything else to do.Despite its flaws, though, Karneval is a fairly enjoyable show. Nothing amazing, but an okay plot and attractive males make it an appealing watch for the female masses.Overall 7/10Yeah, Karneval gets a 7/10 from me. I completely understand when people rate it lower than this, though. Watching an anime and not being the target audience sucks, and makes the anime seem dull. With animes like ""Karneval"" it just isn\'t clear that the audience consists of young females with a liking for very mild shounen-ai. Have one of those girls watch a high-rated ecchi... and she won\'t like it either.Anyway, I hope you found my review to be helpful and I would love to know whether you agree or disagree with me! a decent plot, you sometimes get the feeling that it\'s just too much at once.

So this won't be very long.Many of the biggest complaints about the series seems to be caused by the fact it follows the manga with little changes then cuts off where the first arc ended naturally. In other words, the ending is exactly what happened in the manga so they can pick up where they left off if they ever want to...continue with another season by just continuing to follow the manga (unlike another anime adaptation I know *cough* Pandora Hearts). Since it keeps the pacing of the manga, it is by no means a complete story. We're given bits and pieces of story and information about the world and characters but the anime ends before that information starts coming together in the manga. continue with another season by just continuing to follow the manga (unlike another anime adaptation I know *cough* Pandora Hearts).

Gareki picked my interest so it would've been cool to know him a bit better.The story lacked action and drama and the last...episode was too hasty, I expected the anime to end with something cool but it was over too quickly.Way too quickly.The ending alone proved that this anime needs a season two with a better story, where we get to see the main characters in actual action.So yeah, overall 6 because of the lack of action and the unknown reasons for why things turned out the way they did. episode was too hasty, I expected the anime to end with something cool but it was over too quickly.Way too quickly.The ending alone proved that this anime needs a season two with a better story, where we get to see the main characters in actual action.So yeah, overall 6 because of the lack of action and the unknown reasons for why things turned out the way they did."", 'I don\'t usually write reviews, but at this one I feel like I have to share my opinion with you. Especially with people who expect an exciting and interesting action anime. Because that\'s NOT what you get from this one.First of all, I really wanted to like this anime. I haven\'t read the manga yet, so i can\'t say anything about that. But after watching the trailer of the anime, i was sure that no doubt, this is going to be an amazing action fantasy anime, with horror elements. But they basically cut all of the badass looking scenes in the anime, and titled it...as trailer, making it look like, what I expected it to be: twisted, sick, with horroristic enemies and nerve wracking fights.Let me start by saying, how many chances they missed, when it comes to characters. In the beginning we met Gareki and Nai. It could have been interesting if the anime just followed their journey, but no. As soon as they met the organisation called Circus, they blended into the crew of the ship, and became uninteresting sidecharacters. So I was basically left with 2 interesting episodes in the beginning. After that I couldn\'t even tell anymore, who was supposed to be the main character, because, non of them got enough time on screen to be somewhat loveable, or to make the audience get attached to them.But let me explain one by one:Nai: They could have done so much with him, but instead, his character showed absolute no development. Expect his ability to hear noises, the others can\'t, he didn\'t do anything. He wasn\'t mysterious, nor interesting. And I get it, what they were trying the do. But it didn\'t work. Nai was supposed to be the typical naiv and innocent boy, who only sees the good in the world, but it just became forced after a while, and he didn\'t get depth to him, and because of that we couldn\'t actually understand or like him.Gareki: He is the ""badass"" guy in this anime. Even tho he basically doesn\'t do anything, only in the first and in the last episode. But other than that, all he does, is staring at the events, that are happening around him, and getting kidnapped everytime He doesn\'t fight, barely talks, or shows any development. I was pretty surprised at some parts. For example, when they were sent to the ship, he wanted to go back into the town. You would think, oh sure because he wanted to go on his own way. But no. He wanted to go, to buy clothes?! I have never seen any ""badass"" characters like this. Just as i said at Nai, the character doesn\'t work, as they wanted it to.Yogi: The character, you could barely ever take seriously. He was supposed to be the funny guy, but yet again: it didn\'t work. He was quiet annoying at times, just as Nai. There wasn\'t any depth to him, and his personality was too similar to Nai\'s.Throughout the anime, I could see how hard they tried to give us some fanservice by giving us ""cute"" guys and scenes, but it failed. Even the relationships between them turned out to be boring, and we didn\'t see them interacting to each other in private, so there was no sign of the relationships developing to a deeper level, where the characters could have gotten attached to each other.But there was an other thing about the characters that bothered me. The looks. I don\'t really want to write a lot about this, but I feel like i have to mention it. In the beginning everything fine, but after that, they gave the characters pink and girly outfits, which didn\'t really fit them. Especially at Gareki.The plot could have been better, if they explained some things. But no, we were left with many questions, a lot of plot holes, and with scenes or claimes that didn\'t make much sense.This anime was full of awkward and boring situations/scenes. And they characters we met but only for a few episodes were forgottable, and they had no power to share us some emotions.The fights. Theye were the worst. I can forgive the not much developed or weird looking characters, but not the fights. Especially because there was BARELY ANY. We got a few ones, but these ""fights"" were the worsts i have ever seen in any anime. They were  finished in few seconds, and most of the time, with a sidecharacter, who showed up from nothing, just in the final moment. Noone else did anything, and most of the time, expect Yogi none of the main characters even attempted to fight. Why?!And they didn\'t even show the end of the fights in the final episodes!Now you may ask \'But if there was barely any ""fighting"" in the anime, then what was?\'- Mostly boring and uninteresting scenes. Pointless situations and forgottable moments, and characters, and basically no or just a few seconds lasting fights. In the trailer were the only cool parts, and we could have gotten much more out of it.We didn\'t even get a boss fight or a big explaination for everything in the final episode.But the the visuals and the sound were outstanding.In conclusion, I am very disappointed, what this anime turned out to be. I\'m not judging if anyone likes it, even tho i can\'t understand why. All I\'m saying is, that this is just my opinion, no hate towards the fans. But I just think it\'s so sad, how they had so much to work with and they missed it all. It started out soo good, but ended as a boring and unenjoyable anime. And I can\'t give a higher score for like 2 fine episodes in the whole anime. as trailer, making it look like, what I expected it to be: twisted, sick, with horroristic enemies and nerve wracking fights.Let me start by saying, how many chances they missed, when it comes to characters.

Regardless, it was a very enjoyable and interesting show.The story was very interesting, and more parts of the plot would be revealed as the show went on, I don't want to spoil too much. The problem is that Karneval is short, only 13 episodes and the last episode doesn't tie the story together, instead only furthers causes viewers to ask more questions. Because of this, its difficult to comprehend what is going on, or the significance of a character. This really disappointed me and brought the show down, because more...of the show is much needed! Despite this, the show somehow managed to fit so many different events in and was very fun to watch.Of course, the art in the show was so beautiful and attractive. There are even colourful details in the character's eyes. The settings looked really great too. When the characters use magic, I'm stunned looking at it. The soundtrack sounds amazing and the opening is very bright. Paired with the great art style, the action scenes are very enjoyable.I really loved the characters of the show. Their unique designs made them easy to remember and fit their personalities well. The two main characters are opposite in both personality and looks, yet they're still so closely bonded. The other characters are also so interesting, however the show is so short you don't get to see much of them. Nai and Gareki developed nicely by the end of the show, yet maintained their character integrity. Nai is very weak, but he is a useful asset to Circus and his friendly and kind hearted personality helps the people around him. Gareki however seems to not be nice or friendly, but as the show goes on, his kind actions are revealed. Overall, very enjoyable to watch, however extremely unfinished and unsatisfying ending. of the show is much needed!

somewhat mysterious plot and only 13 episodes it\'s clear that some scenes will be rushed, but still I ended up enjoying the whole series.StoryThe story is quite simple but It\'s somewhat mysterious as well, as Nai is simply searching for Karoku he has no Idea on what\'s going on to Karoku, while Gareki who doesn\'t really care much about anythinig tries to find himself, like a typical lone wolf protagonist,  despite how simple it is there are still times where you\'\'ll get...confused and ask ""what\'s going on"" and while they do have some answers on some questions example is how their ower work I still feel its rushed, still the series kinda feels like we need more (thus I need a season 2), on top of that we have no background whatsover with the secondary charactersCharactersMajority of them we\'re almost eye candies but still they get a fair share of development though they have a lot of room for improvement, Nai is pretty adobrable but he\'s pretty naive, on top of that I think among all characters he has the least development or I guess It\'s the fact that he is still learning a lot of stuffs.Gareki for me I think that the most character development, it might be cliche but yeah he learns to trust people, plus his tsundere side is somewhat cute.Tsukumo and Yogi, they\'re pretty fun to watch but I feel like I need to know them more, plus we need more of their backstories,the secndary characters were okay, I kinda feel like Hirato is being bland I personally prefer tsukitachi over him, the villains we\'re kinda boring as well, though I do like Jiki and Kiichi.Sound and ArtThe art is great I like everyone\'s design personally, It really cpatured their personalities well, the sound is pretty much okay, I really enjoyed the opening it gives me the Bungou stray dogs feels.EnjoymentYeah despite the serires having it\'s own flaws I still ended up enjoying it, maybe because I like this type of genre with cool designs, plus I find the theme unique since Circus + detective work that\'s out of this world.Overall Karneval is a great anime where it still has a room for improvement, I think a lot of people will like this but I think a lot won\'t as

believe the people who didn't like it. it's worth checking out. don't let that shojo tag fool you there is no  romance within this anime what soever. the only reason it says shojo is because most of the guys are shotas. but the story is really good for there being only one season, it makes you ache for a second season. and in my book that means it's a good quality anime. along with that the art is beautiful, sound is great, character development is pretty solid although i wish...some of the other characters got more screen time. but in all this anime is a shojo that even guys could get into with the action and mysterious plot line it's something that anybody could enjoy. if you're a fan of man globe's work then this anime won't disappoint so give it a try it just might surprise you. some

I\'m not a big fan of writing a lot and I prefer to summarize things to a short extent, so bear with me.Plot - AppallingKarneval is simply about a boy named Nai who searches for a man named Karuku. He later runs into Gareki, who is a fifeteen year old thief. I\'ll admit, when I heard about this anime I thought it was going to be centered around a circus and have a whimsical theme to it; however, the entire ""carnival"" thing is portrayed in a different way.Digging depper into...the plot of Karneval, it is extremely appaling and the pacing is under whelming. Circus is an organization that gathers information about monsters named Varuga; now this is where the anime begins to fall. Karneval explains little to no information about Circus, leaving us with a handful of unanswered questions. They lack information about Circus. On top of that, the plot is extremely disjointed.Characters - BadThis is another point that Karneval fails tremendously in. The characters are one dimensional with little to no depth. There\'s really no point in going in-depth about the characters because they\'re horribly written. The side cast is very uninteresting, and they barely get any screentime.Art - ExquisiteNow this is where Karneval begins to shine. The art of Karneval is absolutely beautiful and exquisite with eyecatching visuals. It\'s undeniable that the characters are extremely prepossessing and attractive. The bright outfits and great character designs are extremely appealing. This is the area where you\'ll be appreciating the most from Karneval.Sound - EargasmsA bit exaggerating, but the sound quality of Karneval is delightful to hear. The only thing I have to mention about the sound area is that the opening is one of my favorites. Simply put - I like the hardcore vibe in it. The ending takes more of a less hardcore approach, but it\'s still great.Enjoyment - DecentKarneval ia definitely not the most enjoyable series you\'ll ever run into. There are scenes when the anime becomes extremely underwhelming and uninteresting to watch. I\'ll confess that the visuals are so appealing which is the main reason why I enjoyed this anime somewhat.Conclusion - ForgettableKarneval has way too much wasted potential. If you\'re looking for an anime with pleasuring visuals that will give some eyegasms, then you can go ahead and watch Karneval. However, the amazing visuals dosen\'t change the fact the plot and characters are absolutely dreadful and appalling.

I won\'t spoil...it.The story went no where, just a few missions and a big battle at the end and begs hoping it would get a season 2 thou nothing is ever explain like why our villains doing so; yes its okay to leave the watcher questioning until the big reveal happens however it just forgot about it and doesn\'t come back, the characters are flat and dull, none are interesting or develop.The sad thing is that the colors where the only thing good about it.I would only remmened it if you want to watch it for laughs it.The story went no where, just a few missions and a big battle at the end and begs hoping it would get a season 2 thou nothing is ever explain like why our villains doing so; yes its okay to leave the watcher questioning until the big reveal happens however it just forgot about it and doesn\'t come back, the characters are flat and dull, none are interesting or develop.The sad thing is that the colors where the only thing good about it.I would only remmened it if you want to watch it for laughs', ""Honestly this is not a bad anime....it just is not an exceptional anime that I will remember.The Excellent:I actually liked the characters...even Nai, the main character. He is pretty much an all around useless character that is constantly in a situation and weak and the mystery surrounding him is a bit meh....and the reveal...Well, Garecki's reaction basically mirrored my own.Garecki is probably my favorite. Your typical bad boy type who rarely smiles and is quick to anger...but he had far more depth to him and I loved his evolution over 13 episodes.Yogi as well as the other Circus members make fantastic secondary characters and they...weren't just there for background...they actually were integral parts even with their own backstories.Though Jikki is a close second...I just love that twisted like jerk.The Good:I enjoyed the artwork. Beautiful and well-designed and an absolute pleasure to watch. I can't really criticize the artwork.To me there was a subtle/hidden Boy's Love/Shounen-Ai hint. It is never expressed or anything but it was there and I enjoyed that aspect.The bad:The overall mystery was boring and it felt more like a bunch of stories happening at once and there are some filler episodes(even with only 13 episodes) to the point that by the time we get back to the plot it's like...IDC really.And The Ugly:The pacing....It's not a boring anime but it does drag a bit and the ending episodes(episode 12 and 13) are incredibly rushed.I still have no idea what the hell the overall plot was about and what happened in the end. I was a bit meh about that.And the most annoying thing is probably Nai constantly calling out for his friend or whatever. It got annoying but I am glad that as the anime went on he wasn't doing it every episode like he was early on.All in all, it was a good anime to watch if you want some decent character development and great artwork and action scenes are decent.But don't go into this anime expecting to see some masterpiece or high action or even a cohesive plot.... weren't just there for background...they actually were integral parts even with their own backstories.Though Jikki is a close second...I just love that twisted like jerk.The Good:I enjoyed the artwork.

There are very minor differences, the biggest one being how Gareki leaves at the very end of the show, but other than that it is almost perfect. The anime really left on a cliffhanger and I would highly recommend reading on from where the anime left off in the manga.The show is unlike any style I've seen before and it's communicated very well. The colours are sparkly and vibrant and very pleasing to look at.

It became hard for the audience to understand exactly what was happening, and how.The borderline shounen ai sometimes was a turn off too.In conclusion, it could've been much better.Art: 10I have to say, this is where the story excels. The art is flawless and the battle scenes are outstanding. Even the characters were very good looking and appealing.It was perfect. That's all for this section.Sound: 8I really did like the OP and ED.They worked well together, and fit the anime well.Characters: 7Oh boy. This is the part in which I have a lot to say.Although the MC was cute, there wasn't really anything more to say about him. I hoped to see him go from kind of useless to a crucial member of the group.Something like what happened in Akatsuki no Yona.But he remained kind of useless even till the last episode.The side characters were very strong and they were enjoyable,in my book at least, but they too had little development throughout the series.The one character that particularly stood out to me was Gareki. This guy, he was fantastic.He was brave, fearless, and strong throughout the entire show. He was one of the things that made this show from a mess to satisfactory.Enjoyment: 7Despite my bashing of this show, I have to say this anime had its moments and elements.

Not great, not horrible, but just fine , somewhere in the middle.Do I recommend it?If you want an anime with a a great plot that will just suck you in?Then no.But if you want to just let off some stress, with a cute anime that has some comedy and hot guys, then go for it!! they went about it though, was what messed it up.For a very long time, the episodes were very random, and seemingly had no development.When the plot actually did start to take form, way too many things started happening at once.

Unfortunately, I think the producers spent too long milking the possibility of being more than friends - so much so that the show ends with so many loose ends. Relationships, plot and context still remain ambiguous. It's not a bad show, but it seems it would've taken more episodes to wrap things up. I recommend watching for the aesthetics and character dynamics. Just be ready for the fact that you might have to resort to seeking out source material to actually resolve your queries.Anyways, I always get...this show confused with K project. Both have white-haired MCs, and both shows have a strange preoccupation with the letter K. this show confused with K project.

If you love adventure, action, comedy, magic, and shounen, this is definitely for you!!Story- The story is very complex, but easy to understand. Everyone has their special stories, and events give many plot twists, so you won't get bored or expect cliche scenes. The story is definitely something creative and never before told. 9/10Art- The art is just amazing! Everything is especially well drawn, coloured, detailed, and animated. It's completely enthralling. If you are a person who is very critical of good animation and artwork, you will most definitely NOT be...disappointed by Karneval. 10/10Sound- The voice acting is absolutely amazing and perfectly fits every character! The action sounds are also very realistic and match the scenes. The sound is in very high quality, and you will not be disappointed!Also, the OP & ED are known to bring smiles upon everyone's faces, even if something very sad happens in the series. 9/10Character- The characters are so unique. The main characters include Nai, Gareki, Karoku, Tsukumo, Yogi, and Hirato. They are all wonderfully drawn and depicted very realistically, you will instantly be drawn in by them. The voices match them perfectly, and they are amazingly drawn. 10/10Enjoyment- I, personally, found this to be one of the most enjoyable anime to date. The story just keeps you enticed, and you want to keep continuing the story. -FAIR WARNING!: You will most likely become hooked on this anime, if you have liked what I have told you so far-The mystery of the story keeps you wondering, the action/fights keep you on your toes,  and there is plenty of well placed comedic relief. 10/10Overall- 10/10 As if you couldn't tell already, I absolutely ADORE this anime, it is the one of the most heartwarming, funniest, suspenseful, ADDICTING, stories ever.

The premise and the initially presented plot are very interesting, and you are thrown into the action almost immediately. The series follows the adventures and exploits of the protective combat agency, Circus, whose operatives' objectives are to stop the monsters that they believe threaten humanity. Why on earth it is called 'Karneval' instead of 'Circus' is unknown to me.From the get-go, the beginning is exceptionally grabbing, as, from second one, you are introduced to both main characters, as well as a clear...breed of antagonist for the next thirteen episodes. There are many questions presented, and eventually answered, but some not to the extent that would be preferably satisfying. Due to poor time management, I believe some of the bigger questions are lost in all the fancy battle work.The story is okay, but what really takes it down from a higher score is the poor time and overall plot management. A thief named Gareki and a mysterious boy named Nai are introduced as your main characters, but their stories and what makes them /them/ sometimes gets muddled in with every thing else the series tries to cover in so little time. Many of the time management problems arise from spending two whole episodes on side characters you will literally never see again.Episode-to-episode, the adventure is enjoyable to follow, at least for temporary interest, but there are many choppy side missions and admittedly, the ending feels very rushed. There is A LOT to fit in, what with the large cast of characters and the many, many conflicts the show must get through. However, almost everything is summed up in the end, and there is little you are left unsatisfied with, unless you're a die-hard plot fanatic. The relationship between Nai and Karoku, a man he is looking for, provides a very weak closer and is probably the biggest let down.Also, a warning: the anime borderlines Boys' Love, and all of your male characters cannot appear in a scene without a bit of homosexual subtext. Nothing really happens, but this is just a fair warning. Everyone is very touchy-feely.The art is a wide rainbow of detail, but most of this is directed toward characters rather than the background, which is almost obnoxiously plain. Each character is developed very different so you can almost pick them out by appearance instead of by name.This stands out as a bit of a flaw.There are almost too many characters packed into Karneval, most of whom are attractive men of every trope, most likely for the purpose of pleasing the female viewer. Everyone tries to be a unique member of this anime's cast, when really there is not enough time to cover why each person has a special and unique personality. Your main characters are, in my opinion, quite likable though; you have Gareki, who is your very typical stubborn-strong-silent type, and a lot of time is devoted to him throughout the series. Karneval does a splendid job of handling his talents as well as his flaws, and it is greatly appreciated. You also have Nai, who is very mysterious, but by the end of the series, I do not believe he gets as much development as he deserves. It feels almost unfinished on his end, while many of the other characters receive the closure they need.A very big problem is the wide cast of side characters, all of whom are incredibly detailed but do not have full personalities to flesh them out. I cannot recall some of their names, and they do not strike me as vital to the plot, though they do not necessarily harm it.The sound was nothing very special; again, mostly an addition to please young teenage girl viewers and the similar. The beginning song is a bit harsh for the anime and doesn't quite capture the feel of fun that is really contained within. The ending is VERY reminiscent of some BL's I've seen, but suits the show surprisingly better. That's how close to BL it is, folks.My enjoyment of the show sort of trailed off as the episodes went on, mostly because later episodes do not compare to the ever-flashy beginning. Halfway through I was mostly waiting for them to get to the point and worrying about how they were going to successfully rap everything up well enough for the many hours I'd wasted. That, and I was almost waiting for two of them to have sex already, given the BL vibe.Karneval, in terms of plot, is nothing incredibly special. You have a pretty large chance of finding a character to like, given how vary large and colorful the cast is, and may be some good ground to tackle if you trouble yourself with writing fanfiction.All in all, Karneval is strong in fanservice and I believe that is the large characteristic that I'm going to remember it by, and to all you young, hungry Free! fans out there, I believe this really is your cup of tea. breed of antagonist for the next thirteen episodes.

You have a pretty large chance of finding a character to like, given how vary large and colorful the cast is, and may be some good ground to tackle if you trouble yourself with writing fanfiction.All in all, Karneval is strong in fanservice and I believe that is the large characteristic that I'm going to remember it by, and to all you young, hungry Free! fans out there, I believe this really is your cup of tea."", 'Really adorable show! I love the art style of the characters! But now that I think about it, the beginning was kind of stupid and I ""laughed out loud"" so many times cause it was ridiculous. Like why was this little boy, Nai, so obsessed with this one guy, Karoku? It makes since later on in the show why he\'s this way, and so from their the show grew on me. The character development and the relationships between all of them is splendid. I absolutely love Yogi, along with Gareki and Nai. And Tsukumo is cute too, along with the Akari and Hirato. Such an...adorable show!~ I foresee a second season! :3 adorable show!~ I foresee a second season! :3', ""It's easy to be drawn into this anime by just looking at the artwork and style. Characters with multicolored eyes, stylish colorful hair, and original outfits. The animation is pretty, to sum it up, and is very appealing, and its easy to get drawn into. For the story, it was a good idea, but it was way to complex for an anime series only 13 episodes long. Even reading some of the synopsis it has, it seems pretty confusing. They tried to fit a complex story line for multiple different characters, and it just confused the crap out of me.The story was poorly told. I...still enjoyed it though, mostly because how visually appealing it was. The characters were a bit annoying at times, but they weren't boring and developed well throughout the running time. Overall, it was enjoyable, but nothing great. still enjoyed it though, mostly because how visually appealing it was.

See, I'm a sucker for anime with carnival themes. So, as soon as I heard of this, it immediately became a top priority on my list.

But they don't have deep personalities or something. They're don't stand out when it comes to personalities. Nai is cute and all. I love Gareki and Yogi because they are voiced by my two favorite voice actors Hiroshi and Miyano. They give you a warm feeling when you see them opening their hearts up to each other, but that's about it.Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed it mostly because of the art and it truly has its awesome moments. You'll see if you watch.Overall (8/10) I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to take a break from all the serious and dark anime that is so popular right now.

And the line-up of the voice actors was also intriguing- a reason on its own to be excited about this anime. But somehow this anime fell short of what could have been one of my favs.So, how..? The story has a clear direction and the characters are all strong. There's plenty of action - all the Circus members are agile, and Gareki's skills to create bombs and to use a gun is also believable for an orphan. The art is brilliant - literally, one of the most colorful anime...out there, from the costumes to the background. The sound is also excellent - the music enhances each scene, and the voice actors all did a great job (even though I hoped for slightly more from Mamoru Miyano since I admire his work). Normally with all this mentioned, I'd be continuing on raving about this anime at this point. However, the story lacked in depth, and more than anything, the characters lacked development.The story is pretty easy to understand; there's the good guys (Circus) and the bad guys (Kafka/Varuga), and then there's Nai who's searching Karoku, with the help of Gareki. The pace of the story bothered me the more I think back, how it kept on jumping from scene to scene, and the focus kept shifting from one character to the next. It also seemed as if the emotional side of the anime ie. Gareki's past was at times too forced, and therefore lost the effect.The characters started strong, and then they pretty much stayed the same. Gareki stayed stubborn, Nai was just a strange creature with heightened sense of hearing, Hirato was always cool, Tsukumo was quiet and hard to grasp, and Karoku was a mystery til the end. The only character that had a slight development was Nagi, but that was more of a discovery of his dark side, not so much a change in him that was caused by an affect.So with all the potential this anime had, it really is unfortunate that the outcome is less than satisfactory. It shows how important it is to build the characters so that you could really connect with them, and also to build a story that draws you closer to the characters. In a way I think that due to the art and sound I had higher expectations getting into this anime. And I continued to watch, curious to find out whether it would meet the level of my expectations.If I were to recommend this at all, it would be to those few who are looking for a short series that is filled with detail in art and sound. Enough said. out there, from the costumes to the background.

Enough said."", 'So the all-star cast and the nice art drew me in.I was not impressed.A small heads-up: I\'ve only watched 5 eps of this show. If what I say below doesn\'t hold true for those who have watched the entire show, my apologies.The first episode seemed like the overture for a HUGE plot and some serious worldbuilding. However it soon became clear that the show had no intention of tying up its knots. Some things were just left hanging, and I got more and more confused. As I moved on to the later episodes, it was clear that the scope of the world had narrowed,...nullifying all of its ""foreshadowing"" in the pilot episode.For example, in the very start, a woman was holding Nai (main character) captive, but the show never explains why. When an intruder comes into the room where Nai was, the woman just... walks off and disappears for a while. Just...why? A lot of things in the show don\'t make much sense.Which leads us to my biggest problem with show: the special abilities. The special abilities of different characters  were not elaborated upon (at least till ep5), and that could have been alright if those abilities hadn\'t been so damn inconsistent. It\'s not an exaggeration when I say that this show has one of the least comprehensive magical systems I have ever seen. The characters\' abilities seemed to fluctuate purely for the plot.As for the characters, they were FINE, but they were just fine. The main protagonist (Nai) is kind of atypical in that he is a completely useless mascot-ish main character, which is not really a virtue when you think about it. Gareki on the other hand is quite run-of-the-mill, the tsundere guy with a ""bad boy front"" but a good heart. However, his design is pretty nice, although there is nothing particularly outstanding about it. Unfortunately for this show, Gareki and Nai are the most prominent characters, yet neither of them do much, mostly relying on others to clean up their mess. None of the other supporting characters piqued my interest, so not much more to say here.Overall, I feel like the whole world here caters to Gareki and Nai, making their decisions easy for them and effectively allowing them to do whatever they want, since some deus ex machina will appear in time to save them from whatever danger they\'re in. That\'s the halo of protagonists maxed out for all you viewers.The best thing about this anime is just the art. However, that\'s not surprising considering its source material: look the manga up. The mangaka sure knows her (his?) stuff. Her art is STUNNING.And after reading the first chapter of Karneval\'s manga, the verdict is in: the manga is better than the anime. The manga addresses nearly all of the problems that I had with the first ep. Which begs the question: why the pointless changes??

There was a lot going on, and not a whole hell of a lot came out of it, so I'm not sure how I'm gonna review this one; let's just go with why it wasn't a hit for me.The story and plot was nonexistent, to me. There was one thing the story had going for it in a consistent manner, and that was the idea of finding this person that the main character had lost touch with, and nothing was done with that plot point for 97% of the anime. I guess another...to say it is that Karneval had zero direction. The positive points I'll note for the story is where it was hinted to go at the end of the final episode. Which is... not a lot to go on, but the set up for it was one of the more interesting things I watched.As for my gripes about the characters, most of them were flat; the few that weren't were not developed properly at all. For example, I saw characters having personal revelations that weren't hinted at at all before they happened. A couple of the characters' relationships, though, did peak my interest, although they weren't explored properly at all.To harp more on the messiness, the sequence of events and the overall tone of the anime made everything feel forced. There seemed to be things I was supposed to find important, but rather than convince me that they were, the narrative just shoved it in my face without much more to go on. Similarly, there were things that I did find important to the story that weren't ever covered beyond mentioning them. As an example, I could use-- oh, I don't know-- the entire Karneval universe itself. There was so much by way of fantasy mechanics and abilities that was never at all explained. Most of the time, I didn't get what was happening because of that.I did see potential for *something* in Karneval, but whatever it was was more or less washed away by how convoluted it felt. As I said, there were characters I liked seeing on screen together, and I think the rest of the story might be interesting, but it just wasn't enough for me to give this anime a high rating. Without proper backstory of the Circus, the antagonists, their history, the protagonists, etc., it just wasn't doing for me. Plus, the fight scenes were kinda crap, which isn't something I'd want to see from an anime in the action genre. It may be something you find endearing, but ultimately, Karneval was just a way for me to pass the time. to say it is that Karneval had zero direction.

Choosing this anime as my starter for the binge, I curled up in bed with a bowl of chips, and turned on the first episode, unaware of the utter disappointment and annoyance I was soon to experience.As a side note, this may just be, with no exaggeration, one of the WORST anime I have ever seen in my experience with the...genre. Though there are certainly things worth praising, my biggest problems - the story and characters.Story 4/10Normally I enjoy this kind of monster-hunting genre, and the sci-fi themes and funky, colorful atmosphere definitely seemed promising as I\'m a sucker for these things. However, as I progressed through the episodes, I soon realized that funky colors and good art were pretty much the only decent things the show had to offer. Plotlines come out of nowhere for no reason, then disappear without ever being mentioned again, specifically Garaku\'s friend\'s and their ""arc"". We\'re told that Kafka is this horrible organization that practices human experiments, which result in the monsters that Circus, the good guys, hunt down and kill. What are Kafka\'s motivations? Never explained. Nai\'s backstory (and half the characters\' backstories), Circus\' origins, and half of the lore (or lack thereof) are all never explained. Also, the main characters, Nai and Garaku, felt like they never did anything at all to help - they were just dragged around by Circus because the monsters are attracted to Nai and he makes it easier to find them. Plus, whenever something remotely bad happened to any of the good guys, it was immediately remedied without any struggle or effort. If the show had been longer, maybe it would have benefitted and had time to flesh out everything mentioned above, but obviously, it didn\'t. And I\'m glad, because 13 episodes felt like an eternity.Art 9/10The best thing about the show that pretty much everyone agrees with is the art style - it is absolutely gorgeous. The colors, the way the characters are drawn, the intro animation, the creativity of the sheep robot-things on the airships, and especially the backgrounds - all of it was stunning to look at, and I feel horrible for the poor artists who wasted their hard work on this piece of garbage anime.Sound 5/10Decent soundtrack, except for the voice acting (in the English version - I prefer the dubs and have no shame.) I don\'t know who cast the actors for this show in the dub, but they FAILED big time. Nai, Garaku, Yogi, and half of the characters have voices that don\'t match them in the slightest, and it was incredibly distracting. I don\'t think it was a directing issue since I\'ve heard these actors in other anime and they were actually very good in them, the casting was just wrong.Character 3/10Ok this was probably my biggest issue with the show. I could\'ve tolerated a half-baked story if the characters were actually worth caring about, or even smart for that matter. Firstly, I HATED Nai. I know he\'s supposed to be all innocent and naive and kind, but he came off as a useless crybaby that never matured at any point in the show. He never fights, he\'s almost too naive to the point where he\'s stupid, and whenever he acts nice to other characters with the intention of being nice, it annoyed me just as much as it did the other characters, and I wanted him to just shut up. I like innocent characters, but Nai was too useless and annoying to be likable. I also hated Garaku - he\'s supposed to be the bad boy who\'s secretly a softie, but he just comes off as a jerk. He never does anything to actually care about his friends and just hurts them constantly. (Plus his voice was OBNOXIOUSLY out of place). Both he and Nai are fairly useless throughout the show as they rarely fight (Nai never fighting at all). Tsukumo was probably the most tolerable of all of them, mainly because I felt nothing about her at all. She\'s the kuudere of the group, so she\'s very emotionless and quiet but secretly is sweet and caring. \'Cept one thing... they missed the sweet and caring part ._. not to mention that she barely hangs out with the other characters even though she\'s supposed to be one of the main 4, and yet somehow by the end of the show she\'s close enough with them all to join in a group hug. Yogi was funny for the first couple of episodes but soon became annoying - specifically his constant crying and overdramatic attitude.As for the overall opinions of the characters... they were all annoying and stupid. At one point Tsukumo gets kidnapped (after getting punched once in the stomach and just passing out), and she wakes up in a room alone tied to a chair - a room with WINDOWS, mind you, with her kidnappers nowhere in sight. She breaks free and moves around the room for a while, and decides to leave out the DOOR to the room, even though there is a PARTY currently going on in the mansion XDD if she\'s so good at fighting, why couldn\'t she just leave through the window? Surely she would have been fine and wouldn\'t have alerted anyone. And as if that wasn\'t enough, literally NONE of her friends even care that she\'s missing! They don\'t even try to go after her or panic! XD if her own ""friends"" in the show don\'t even care about her, why should the viewer? Anyway, that was just one funny thing that I noticed while watching lolEnjoyment 2/10I was physically in pain while trying to get through the last few episodes because of how boring and lackluster the watch experience was. I only finished it so that I could mark it as completed on MAL. Plus, I was watching Overlord at the same time as this, and I binged all 3 seasons of that BEFORE finishing this one because I dreaded coming back to it that much.Overall 3/10With the exception of the art and music, this anime SUCKED. The lackluster story and characters, the unfocused plot with no stakes, the horrific English voice acting, the lack of care for the characters from each other, and the painfully slow yet rushed pacing - this may take the cake as one of the worst anime I\'ve ever seen. Unlike Shiki though (one of my least favorite anime), which I hated because I had built up high hopes (which ended up crushed) and because of the awful message, Karneval was bad because of writing and characters. If it was longer and focused more on the rivalry between organizations and gave more time for the characters to connect with each other, plus came up with more interesting monster interactions and more original character backstories, it could have been a masterpiece. Overall it was a waste of time, potential, money, and effort from the poor artists that had to work on this show. Wouldn\'t recommend nor rewatch. genre.

The only thing i regret was that there was no romance at all, but who needs romance when you got action!!! i also liked the varuga thing and it was kind of like mixing science fiction and fantasy...and something else together which made it very interesting to watch. if you like unique stuff like me you should totally watch it, if you are a girly girl and all you want is romance don't watch it, if you like epic endings and epic/evil main characters maybe you should try watching it but i don't believe you would love it, anyways…the art is great the voice acting was great and yogi is cute!!!! i hope this somehow helped you humans (i believe it didn't help at all) and i hope you have an awfully beautiful day!!! bye bye and something else together which made it very interesting to watch. if you like unique stuff like me you should totally watch it, if you are a girly girl and all you want is romance don't watch it, if you like epic endings and epic/evil main characters maybe you should try watching it but i don't believe you would love it, anyways…the art is great the voice acting was great and yogi is cute!!!! i hope this somehow helped you humans (i believe it didn't help at all) and i hope you have an awfully beautiful day!!! bye bye"", ""I came into the show genuinely /wanting/ to like it but instead finished it bitter and disappointed. The art looked nice and I'm an absolute sucker for a short show with amazing art and a seemingly simple plot. But instead of allowing the show's plot to fit into the 13 episode format, the writers instead attempted to build intrigue through the use of slowly revealed bits of information. While this method of easing the audience into a plot and then moving along slowly (ie establishing then breaking a pattern) works in a long form show to maintain an air of mystery, it leaves shorter shows...like Karneval underdeveloped and lacking.

This is Karneval, the anime about the security agency ""Circus"" and their journey to fight the criminals the police can\'t handle. You\'ll either hate it or like/love it. Depends on your preferences.Story: 4/10 - A bit messy and some plot holes, otherwise it\'s fair enough.The things I dislike about the story is how the characters seems to just go with it, even if they don\'t know anything about each other. I asked myself ""Why do you bring him with you"" in the first episode and I can\'t seem to find the answer even after 13 episodes. Maybe I...haven\'t looked hard enough.

One of the main reasons was because my favorite Japanese voice actor (Hiroshi Kamiya) voiced Gareki who is one of the main characters. I also really loved the colours and art, it was so pretty and very unique and the character's eyes were beautiful. Overall, it was enjoyable to watch and there were some cute characters who I really liked ( especially Yogi.)However, the show lacked plot and I didn't really understand the main concept of the anime. I understand that Nai was searching for Karoku but there were many missions that had no relevance...to the main plot which I found confusing. The story line was a bit pathetic and didn't really appeal to me at all. Also, there is lack of character development and all characters pretty much stay the same throughout the entire anime. I liked Yogi a lot because he was funny and made the show enjoyable. I also loved Gareki but only because he is gorgeous and is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya who voiced Levi from Shingeki no Kyojin soooooo it kind of makes me drool. I didn't like Nai very much and he got on my nerves because he was so useless and pathetic and got way too attached to people he barely even knew.Sound: 7/10The music was really fitting apart from the ending theme. I liked how it sounded like music you would hear at a carnival and the piano osts were really pretty.Action scenes:The action scenes were amazing apart from the fact there was no where near enough of them.

Kyougoku Natsuhiko: Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/279/Kyougoku_Natsuhiko__Kousetsu_Hyaku_Monogatari,"[""Hundred stories, More commonly known as &quot;Requiem From the Darkness&quot; is a horror anime like no other. 13 episodes of the most disturbing and gory stories you'll ever witness. The basic plot of the story is about a young man who is an author journeying to lands where there are mysterious rumors in order to write a book of 100 Japanese horror stories. Every time he encounters the supernatural though he runs into a group of the &quot;Exorcists&quot; traveling Japan to destroy the darkness in people's hearts.Story: Each episode is a separate story in another village, but even though its &quot;Episodic&quot; the relationship between main...characters is still developing. Most episodes start with a very disturbing scene, usually a brutal murder that hints at the &quot;Darkness&quot; behind the episode~ it really pulls you in from episode one~ The first half is setting the stage and characters for the story and how the main character the author meets them. The second half of the episode is discovering the malignant evil in the perpetrator~ catching him commit his crime, and then the exorcists killing him in some manner.What really sets this apart from other anime is the length it went to in shock value; most episodes revolve around the murder, rape, and or plain torture of women and small children...And the story is played out in a way you never see it coming~ Be warned that this is Rated R for these reasons... if you have a weak constitution to gore or horror in general I wouldn't advise you watch this series. No matter how much you think &quot;They're not going to show it... they're going to pane away...&quot; they do show it... generally in the most gruesome manner and in slow motion.Art: The art is very... &quot;Original&quot; I guess~ It is not Standard animation which gives it a nice flair sometimes~ But on some occasions the animation is just so overdone in its unique style that it doesn't look nice on the eyes, or you don't even know whats happening.Sound: The opening and ending are nice, I don't know if they really match with the feeling of the anime, but they're ok; the ending is very calming... which may be something you need to hear after some of the crazy conclusions to episodes. The OST music didn't stick out very much, but it wasn't poorly done at least and it effectively portrayed the mood.Character: The main character balance is a little off; they were original I suppose, but the story almost flows without their presence since each episode is about the episodic characters than the main characters usually (Similar to Jigoku Shoujo).Enjoyment: 95% of the episodes were original and had me on the edge of my seat. They broke so many expectation barriers on Gore... and even more socially taboo things which I will leave as teasers for people who haven't seen the show. If you're more of a fluffy luv luv anime lover, or want some luls... this definitely is not the anime for you~ But if you're thirsting blood and hellish plot twists this anime is right up your alley.Rating: 8/10 characters is still developing.

It was handled by TMS Entertainment, the same studio behind Detective Conan and Monster Rancher. So, how does a studio like that manage with a horror series? Let's take a look and see.Story:We open with a writer named Momosuke. Turns out, he's going on a trip to gather information to write an anthology of a hundred tales. While walking on a rainy night, he nearly falls off of a cliff only to be saved by a traveling monk named Mataichi. Mataichi gives Momosuke directions for a place he can stay...and gives him an ominous warning to go straight there. In the dark, Momosuke stumbles into a derelict looking building where a second traveling monk has shown up. Inside, Momosuke sees that Mataichi is there as well. Mataichi laments Momosuke's inability to listen to people's advice and tells him he's going to see something terrifying. This begins Momosuke's association with Mataichi, Ogin and Nagamimi, three people who find people guilty of horrific crimes and conduct summary executions against them after frightening them into revealing the truth.Let's get into the negative aspects of the series right away. The first is that it relies a lot on coincidence. Once the series gets going there's active trickery to get Momosuke involved in the plot, but early on he just manages to stumble into Mataichi and his group by sheer plot convenience. There's also the issue of him not having much to do in most of the episodes. There are a few where he plays a prominent role in the setup, but in most of them he either makes an incompetent attempt to help the criminal or he observes what's happening from the side-lines and contributes absolutely nothing of value. The reason we follow him being to give us a more outsider's perspective. Like in Yami no Matsuei, the horror elements are largely just dark and disturbing content, but nothing that's actually apt to frighten anyone. The ending is mixed. There is some good setup leading up to it, but the payoff is pretty weak.There is also quite a bit about the series that's good. The premise is genuinely interesting and used to pretty good effect in most of the scenarios. The episodes are a bit formulaic, but there is more than enough variety in the setup and execution of them to keep it compelling. The dark content is handled decently, in spite of every scenario save one being completed in a single episode. I also like the way that the supernatural aspect is handled, but I can't go into too many details on that one without giving away spoilers.Characters:Most of the characters in this series are a bit under-developed and I'm not just talking about the one-shot characters who appear in a single episode, which is the bulk of the characters in the series, or the supporting characters who appear in brief scenes throughout the series. No, I'm talking about the main cast. You never learn much about Mataichi's group beyond some sparse backstory details and basic character traits. Most episodes focus on their target and steadily reveal details about their crime throughout, although even these characters aren't particularly well developed or complex since most of their traits are based on their crimes with a very basic explanation for why they do it. As such, getting invested in the scenarios can be difficult. Momosuke is the most complex character in the series, having a pretty substantial character arc and undergoing changes as a result of everything he goes through.Art:The art has an unusual style. Everything has a textured look to it, kind of like the art of Gankutsuou, but more subdued. They also draw most of the random people in the crowd with very undetailed, blank faces which just kind of blend together. The details on the backgrounds are pretty muted and basic as well. Although I'm not sure if it's laziness or that they thought the series aesthetic would work better if people and things in the background were kept with minimal details. The series does have some obtrusive fan-service, particularly with some of Ogin's scenes, but there isn't a huge amount. I will give them credit in that the imagery that's supposed to be disturbing is very effectively done and the designs for the major characters are nicely handled.Sound:The voice acting is really good. Seki Toshihiko, Wakamoto Norio, Nakao Ryuusei & Kobayashi Sanae voice our main cast and they all do a great job. Although it is a little strange to hear Cell and Freeza give performances together in a serious anime. The music itself is mostly really good at helping set the tone, but sometimes it's used to create a tonal clash which may or may not work depending on your perspective.Ho-Yay:There is no ho-yay in this. There's very little romantic content at all and what there is is het.Final Thoughts:Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari is an anime with some good, compelling ideas but with execution that isn't very good. The characters are largely under-developed and the story has some serious issues. However, it does still have a lot of interesting moments and its art and sound do largely work. If you're interested in the premise and you don't mind the anthology aesthetic then you'll probably like it okay since it is decent enough. Just be advised that some of the content is disturbing. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. Next week, horror anime month continues with a look at Corpse Party. and gives him an ominous warning to go straight there.

I also like the way that the supernatural aspect is handled, but I can't go into too many details on that one without giving away spoilers.Characters:Most of the characters in this series are a bit under-developed and I'm not just talking about the one-shot characters who appear in a single episode, which is the bulk of the characters in the series, or the supporting characters who appear in brief scenes throughout the series. No, I'm talking about the main cast. You never learn much about Mataichi's group beyond some sparse backstory details and basic character traits. Most episodes focus on their target and steadily reveal details about their crime throughout, although even these characters aren't particularly well developed or complex since most of their traits are based on their crimes with a very basic explanation for why they do it. As such, getting invested in the scenarios can be difficult. Momosuke is the most complex character in the series, having a pretty substantial character arc and undergoing changes as a result of everything he goes through.Art:The art has an unusual style. Everything has a textured look to it, kind of like the art of Gankutsuou, but more subdued. They also draw most of the random people in the crowd with very undetailed, blank faces which just kind of blend together. The details on the backgrounds are pretty muted and basic as well. Although I'm not sure if it's laziness or that they thought the series aesthetic would work better if people and things in the background were kept with minimal details. The series does have some obtrusive fan-service, particularly with some of Ogin's scenes, but there isn't a huge amount. I will give them credit in that the imagery that's supposed to be disturbing is very effectively done and the designs for the major characters are nicely handled.Sound:The voice acting is really good. Seki Toshihiko, Wakamoto Norio, Nakao Ryuusei & Kobayashi Sanae voice our main cast and they all do a great job. Although it is a little strange to hear Cell and Freeza give performances together in a serious anime. The music itself is mostly really good at helping set the tone, but sometimes it's used to create a tonal clash which may or may not work depending on your perspective.Ho-Yay:There is no ho-yay in this. There's very little romantic content at all and what there is is het.Final Thoughts:Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari is an anime with some good, compelling ideas but with execution that isn't very good. The characters are largely under-developed and the story has some serious issues. However, it does still have a lot of interesting moments and its art and sound do largely work. If you're interested in the premise and you don't mind the anthology aesthetic then you'll probably like it okay since it is decent enough. Just be advised that some of the content is disturbing. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. Next week, horror anime month continues with a look at Corpse Party."", ""There is no method to the madness. Within Natsuhiko Kyogoku’s Requiem from the Darkness, there are exceptions to be sure but, generally speaking, this is a show where atrocities are committed by people with zero regard for or reasoning behind their actions. Lacking even a passing resemblance of foresight, they’re easily swayed by their self-serving impulses - a bruised ego here, a childish grievance there - into venturing as far as to kill one another.“Kill”, of course, is a massive understatement. The humans depicted here don’t simply murder each other; they do so in a variety of grotesque ways. Victims’ faces are contorted with agony...and heartrending screams are emitted as their eyes are punctured, their limbs severed, their bodies impaled, their flesh scorched, their skulls shattered, and their bones devoured.There are countless shows with content that’s similar to Requiem but they deviate from the latter in terms of intent. With other shows, the carnage not only comes across as excessive but also wholly unnecessary; it’s violence for the sake of violence. With Requiem, however, a difference is established. The focus isn’t directed towards mindless bloodshed. Rather, the killings that occur here serve as testimonies to the cruelty within human nature; they depict the extents to just how abominable we act towards one another.To the Ongyou, exorcists of extraterrestrial origin, these displays of depravity have become depressingly repetitive. Viewing the murders from afar, the Ongyou can’t resist sympathizing with a species that stray from their better judgment time after time. Seeking to steer humanity in a more positive direction (and, at the very least, minimize the amount of destruction we cause), the Ongyou wander throughout the natural world, using their abilities where they see fit.Based on an award-winning collection of short stories, situated within Japan’s Edo period, Requiem from the Darkness is a show that expresses its brutally frank social commentary via various interactions the Ongyou have with other people throughout their journey. At the series’ start, though, they’re more or less on their own. Led by Mataichi (an undersized spiritualist defined by his threadbare cloak and cynical musings), the Ongyou have maintained success in their exploits but circumstances change when they encounter Momosuke.He is Requiem’s primary narrator. He is also a hopeless idealist whose naivety, clumsiness and cowardice have endangered the Ongyou’s objective on numerous occasions. However, Momosuke compensates for this through an expertise in folklore and superstitions. His knowledge is put to good use through the myriad of cases the Ongyou tackle; it’s fascinating to see just how crucial a role Japanese mythology plays in situations involving cannibalism, incestuous rape, matricide, and other grisly crimes.This intersection between the human world and the supernatural is an area Requiem pays close attention to. In particular, it’s concerned with how denizens of the latter perceive the former.When it comes to presenting our surroundings from the Ongyou’s viewpoint, this show spares no expense. The koto and kotsuzumi provide an era-appropriate musical identity to the proceedings (alongside an amalgam of xylophones, bagpipes, orchestral strings, and chantings) as Requiem showcases its visual mastery. Shadows impose on everything in their sight, often enveloping the characters within its foggy folds, perfectly complementing this show’s dour tone. Buildings insult conventions, twisting and turning, unlike ordinary architecture which mostly stands in place.These and more contribute to an aesthetic that celebrates creativity more than anything else. Whatever shortcomings appear along the way (from poorly integrated CGI to inconsistent character design) are almost entirely negated by a show that overwhelms with its endless forays into the visually experimental. Naturally, this artistic pursuit culminates with what’s easily the most haunting sequence in the entire series./A little girl, known as “Tai”, calmly approaches an elderly man undergoing a mental breakdown. Clutching a ragdoll in her arms, Tai converses with this man, her voice cheerful, her eyes radiant with mischief. The exchange then screeches to a halt. Tai exhibits a toothy grin and releases a mocking snicker before she mutates.Luminous purple shadows glimmer on Tai’s countenance and in the pitch-black background behind her as her facial features dissolve into nothingness. What once appeared to be a little girl is now reduced to a corpse, a display of broken bones and frayed hair. However, Tai is unfazed. Ignoring the rivulets of blood that flow from the corners of her mouth (alongside the other changes), she leans closer to the elderly man and continues the conversation, maintaining her cheerful tone.Tai is not real. She’s a replica of an innocent soul. She’s an illusion, conjured by the Ongyou to assist in completing one of their cases. She’s a walking reminder for the elderly man of the life he robbed. On a surface level, Tai’s metamorphosis, observed from the man’s point-of-view, is both aesthetically pleasing and weirdly mesmerizing. On further examination, the sequence is an intimidation tactic the Ongyou employed to persuade the man into acknowledging his mistakes. Watching Tai transform and listening to her explain what the man did (“You cut me in half”) is enough to trigger his repressed memories and bring him a step closer to redemption.The experience also forces him to consider why he killed Tai (and his other victims) in the first place. Were his upbringing and social influences responsible for turning him into a murderer or was his behavior ingrained in him from the start?/Nature vs nurture. This debate serves as Requiem’s overarching theme. The killings, the Ongyou’s mission, the social commentary, and the aesthetic flourishes all ultimately relate to the topic at hand. Yes, this series is, at its core, an examination of humanity at its worst but it’s also interested in determining the impetus for our actions. Although Requiem eventually aligns itself with “nature”, the argument it establishes is one that even the opposition might consider.This show maintains that our natural traits are the biggest inspiration behind our behavior but it doesn’t believe that we are to be forever defined by them. The capacity for evil, to present a specific example, is something Requiem deems an inherent characteristic but this show claims that it’s hardly permanent. Again and again, the people that recognize their inherent evil and consciously seek to improve themselves are the ones who overcome their natural traits. Granted, there are plenty who don’t but that doesn’t prevent Requiem from believing even the worst of us are capable of change.Of course, the road to redemption isn’t easy, not when there are supernatural creatures hindering your progress.Natsuhiko Kyogoku is an award-winning novelist and an admirer of the late mangaka Shigeru Mizuki but he’s also a self-proclaimed “yokai researcher” that’s convinced yokai folklore is a form of sublimation. This idea of his is apparent in almost all of Kyogoku’s works, except for Requiem from the Darkness.With his other projects, he always ensured that the yokai were to never appear. The focus was to remain on the human characters. Yokai and the supernatural myths involving them were only permitted to exist as fables, paralleling a criminal’s motives and behavior. Requiem, on the other hand, is far more liberal in handling yokai.

These are what’s referred to as “yokai”. At first, the ones that the Ongyou encountered were of a simple variety, weird but ultimately harmless creatures with amusing voices and mannerisms. These yokai were loosely involved in Requiem, appearing on a semi-frequent basis, never detracting from the show’s purpose and direction.This wouldn't always be the case. As Requiem’s story develops, the yokai not only become a consistent presence within the show but they also start actively interfering with major events. No longer are they charming oddities. The yokai are now vicious and deadly terrors of the night, legitimate threats that the Ongyou have to contend with in order to complete their mission. This decision is flawed on two fronts. First, having this show revolve around the Ongyou’s various showdowns with the yokai completely derails from the themes it’s been building upon since the beginning. Second, leading these various showdowns towards a final battle is the polar opposite of what makes Requiem special.This show thrives in tight spaces. Requiem’s strength lies within the relatability of its individual dramas, within the isolated yet intimate cases the Ongyou tackle, within the nuanced perspective it lends towards its small-scale events. It is the king of standalone stories.A shame, then, that Requiem’s last four episodes fail to understand this. I’ll admit, though, that the intention behind them (grappling with the demons of your past) was pretty solid (even if it has zero relation to the show’s overall theme) but whatever direction these episodes were driven towards is overshadowed by its halfhearted foray into religious commentary, by its lackluster subplot involving water zombies (what were they thinking with that one?) and by its excessively theatrical main antagonist (“The world as it is now is an illusion!” he bellows, “Within the darkness, there is truth!”).While I will always struggle to understand the reasoning behind those last four episodes, there’s no point in holding that against a series that has earned my respect, admiration and undying loyalty multiple times over.

They take a lot of Japanese folklore and old stories and depict them in a rather interesting way. It does get a little hard to understand in the surreal look. You never know what is real and what is spiritual because of how some of the characters look (More on that in artwork). If you watch it in the dark, be scared. But yet the show almost asks you to watch...it in the dark because it is so dark that it’s hard to see some of the detail.The artwork is rather flat, getting its shading mostly with line drawing like it was done in pen and once in a while giving an almost three dimensional feeling almost CG-ish. It’s hard to depict though, since the CG blends well with the rest of the artwork. It has a certain feel that makes it look vintage though it’s a newer show. The background characters make it hard to know what’s real and what’s not because they all look a bit off. They most of the time look like monsters themselves and sometimes it shows who will be affected because the people that actually look normal turn out to be either killed off or the main character of the show.I fell in love with the English actors, there voices working perfectly with the characters they portray. I especially love Mataichi’s heavy voice, almost a dark monotone though with an air of mystery. He is able to keep the monotone that doesn’t feel boring. Momosuke has a fine voice for the wimpy little boy he seems to be. The music is very hunting and dark, never overpowering but always there to give you a chill up your spine. There isn’t anything to laugh about in this, no comic relief to tone down the story. it in the dark because it is so dark that it’s hard to see some of the detail.The artwork is rather flat, getting its shading mostly with line drawing like it was done in pen and once in a while giving an almost three dimensional feeling almost CG-ish.

So I\'ll stick to the basics while describing my experience after I finished this anime series.Being 13 episodes long, each episodes being less than 25 minutes long, the length of the episodes is certainly not a problem, and works to set the ambience of the anime. However, it is the themes of the anime which make it a difficult watch. It might not be an artistic presentation, but it definitely is a thematic fright, because it talks about...the ""darkness among men"". Within its themes are: cannibalism, necrophilia, murder,  and serial killing among the handful few obvious themes. Each of these themes is the integral part of the episode, and are all small steps towards an overarcing story which is concluded in episode 12 and 13.One criticism which I have in terms of sound, is the theme song ""the flame"" which opens the anime. It isn\'t disconcerting, but it isn\'t serving a significant purpose towards building the anime either. Furthermore, in my opinion, it doesn\'t add to the opening of the anime visually (which is really good, and is undermined because of the theme song). I don\'t count art as requiring criticism because in my opinion, it is aged but it has aged well - and with respect to the anime, it adds an overall sombre tone to the story, which definitely works in its favour.All in all, here\'s my two cents on it: If you\'re really into understanding how dark can a human heart be, watch this anime. Its a decent work to say the very least. the ""darkness among men"". Within its themes are: cannibalism, necrophilia, murder,  and serial killing among the handful few obvious themes.

Its a decent work to say the very least.', 'Horror stories exploring the darkness of the human heart are hardly uncommon, and yet, whenever I come across one, I find myself drawn towards them, fascinated. Perhaps it\'s a subconscious attempt to search for an answer, or perhaps I too find similar darkness residing in my own heart and seek company among such horrors. Regardless of the reason, I feel it\'s fair to say that many anime choose to either reside in the light with stories about finding some semblance of happiness no matter your situation, or they would choose to cheapen the horror with unrealistic tales of amoral and unsympathetic villains you could defeat...like some Dragon Ball Z character. Rarely do writers take a more somber approach, and rarer do writers tell the audience to simply accept the horrors and suffering as part of life and its karmic cycle (as often preached in Buddhism teachings).""Requiem from the Darkness"" is one such uncommon gem.Story: 8Based on a series of short stories by Natsuhiko Kyogoku titled ""The Wicked and the Damned: A Hundred Tales of Karma"", Requiem from the Darkness tells a tale of a young writer named Momosuke who wishes to write a collected anthology of 100 ghost stories and his journey to collect said stories. Shortly after setting out, he meets an enigmatic trio calling themselves ""The Ongyou,"" spirit detectives who investigate myths and legends to expose the truth and righting wrongs along the way.Needless to say, it\'s an episodic anime featuring an \'urban legend of the week\' per episode (save the last two). I usually find myself more interested in episodic series like this because of their freedom to explore multiple sub-themes and stories in one sitting, leading to a greater sense of variety. Each episode sees the quartet investigating the local rumors involving some horror, and each episode ends up with them discovering new depths of human depravity. While the shock factor of the series is its most obvious factor, I feel like most who recommend this series based on that are missing the trees for the forest. Behind these shocking acts is pain, sometimes stemmed from circumstances beyond the person\'s control, but usually committed out of selfishness and temptations. Lust, envy, greed, wrath; all those good stuff that we are familiar with are seen here in this series, all very relatable traits visible in reality.Such a way to explore humanity might be too slow-paced for someone looking for a more concentrated story with some kind of visible end goal in mind, but for those who seek anime that, rather than simply offering simple stories of reaching a goal, instead offer a journey of somber reflection where you can ponder and perhaps lament about life and all its sadness together, such as the likes of ""Mushishi"", ""Kino\'s Journey"" and ""Hell Girl"", this might just be your cup of tea.If there is but one fatal flaw I should point out, it\'s that the final two episodes of the series treads towards a more disappointing formula of having to defeat the Big Bad. It\'s an inevitable part of episodic anime like ""Hell Girl"", it seems. These animation studios often need some kind of climatic build-up at the end rather than just have a string of stories with no end goal, period. Only the few exceptional titles out there are bold enough to really break this convention (""Mushishi"" and ""Kino\'s Journey""), but in all fairness, 11 great episodes out of 13 is good enough for me.Character: 7Unfortunately, this is where the series falls short a little bit. The main characters aren\'t the main attractions of this horror show; the sideshow (the depraved and the diseased) featured each episode are the main appeal. The quartet band of detectives are functional enough as characters. There\'s nothing really inherently wrong with them, since they don\'t come off as obnoxious or even unrealistic individuals. The relationship between Momosuke and The Ongyou is even quite interesting because of the two different worlds they come from - one is an idealistic writer who still believes in the good of people, and the other three are jaded folks of the underworld who have exorcised one too many horrors in their lifetime. Their roles convey the depressing theme of how humanity is screwed up well enough, but as individuals, their personality just aren\'t all that original, being your typical naive kid and jaded exorcists.That being said, as I\'ve previously mentioned, the tragic people involved in the horrendous acts of violence and pillaging are the real reason you should be watching this show for. I know myself and many others have often cited just how ""messed up"" these people are, but it\'s not really a hyperbole especially when the atrocities they committed are realistic acts we\'ve encountered in real life, committed by real serial killers. That\'s what makes it more disturbing than ""Imma blow this whole universe up because genocide! LULZ""Art: 8I\'ve seen people criticized the art as ""low budget"" and messy, but I personally like the artstyle as it resembles the rough penciling of E.C. comic horror stories, not to mention its heavy use of shadows. And to top it all off, the animators also mix the artstyle with dynamic 3-D movement to really grab your attention with distinct visuals, sometimes literally bringing its grotesque body horror to your face.And oh yes - there\'s plenty of body horror. Not as exaggerated as Cronenberg, but enough to resemble something like ""Tales from the Crypt"".Sound: 7The sound is decent enough; nothing that really caught my attention. Its opening and ending songs though are simply lovely Jazz pieces by Keiko Lee, songs that befit the somber atmosphere of the show.Enjoyment: 8What a ride. This is the kind of anime that I will remember fondly in a lifetime; not for some amazingly written plot or even memorable characters it engaged me with, but for the bittersweet taste it has indulged me with. Indeed, I would compare such episodic anime to be like a cuisine, like a series of dishes you would travel around the world for the simple pleasure of experiencing these different facets of life. Or perhaps it\'s more like sharing the company of strangers as we share tragic stories, if only to share in each other\'s misery and come to some form of acceptance towards such a harsh reality. These anime may not be masterpieces that revolutionize the way artists animate stories forever, but they are always welcomed by me, because I will always need such company, especially with how bitter real human interaction can be.We need horror stories in our world, to remind us of the truth that people can be ugly, and that\'s just the way it is. It\'s not ""wrong,"" it\'s not ""right."" It just is. like some Dragon Ball Z character.

These animation studios often need some kind of climatic build-up at the end rather than just have a string of stories with no end goal, period. Only the few exceptional titles out there are bold enough to really break this convention (""Mushishi"" and ""Kino\'s Journey""), but in all fairness, 11 great episodes out of 13 is good enough for me.Character: 7Unfortunately, this is where the series falls short a little bit. The main characters aren\'t the main attractions of this horror show; the sideshow (the depraved and the diseased) featured each episode are the main appeal. The quartet band of detectives are functional enough as characters. There\'s nothing really inherently wrong with them, since they don\'t come off as obnoxious or even unrealistic individuals. The relationship between Momosuke and The Ongyou is even quite interesting because of the two different worlds they come from - one is an idealistic writer who still believes in the good of people, and the other three are jaded folks of the underworld who have exorcised one too many horrors in their lifetime. Their roles convey the depressing theme of how humanity is screwed up well enough, but as individuals, their personality just aren\'t all that original, being your typical naive kid and jaded exorcists.That being said, as I\'ve previously mentioned, the tragic people involved in the horrendous acts of violence and pillaging are the real reason you should be watching this show for. I know myself and many others have often cited just how ""messed up"" these people are, but it\'s not really a hyperbole especially when the atrocities they committed are realistic acts we\'ve encountered in real life, committed by real serial killers. That\'s what makes it more disturbing than ""Imma blow this whole universe up because genocide! LULZ""Art: 8I\'ve seen people criticized the art as ""low budget"" and messy, but I personally like the artstyle as it resembles the rough penciling of E.C. comic horror stories, not to mention its heavy use of shadows. And to top it all off, the animators also mix the artstyle with dynamic 3-D movement to really grab your attention with distinct visuals, sometimes literally bringing its grotesque body horror to your face.And oh yes - there\'s plenty of body horror. Not as exaggerated as Cronenberg, but enough to resemble something like ""Tales from the Crypt"".Sound: 7The sound is decent enough; nothing that really caught my attention. Its opening and ending songs though are simply lovely Jazz pieces by Keiko Lee, songs that befit the somber atmosphere of the show.Enjoyment: 8What a ride. This is the kind of anime that I will remember fondly in a lifetime; not for some amazingly written plot or even memorable characters it engaged me with, but for the bittersweet taste it has indulged me with. Indeed, I would compare such episodic anime to be like a cuisine, like a series of dishes you would travel around the world for the simple pleasure of experiencing these different facets of life. Or perhaps it\'s more like sharing the company of strangers as we share tragic stories, if only to share in each other\'s misery and come to some form of acceptance towards such a harsh reality. These anime may not be masterpieces that revolutionize the way artists animate stories forever, but they are always welcomed by me, because I will always need such company, especially with how bitter real human interaction can be.We need horror stories in our world, to remind us of the truth that people can be ugly, and that\'s just the way it is. It\'s not ""wrong,"" it\'s not ""right."" It just is.', ""I just finished watching Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari and I must say that I'm very, very disappointed.KHM started as a very interesting show. The short stories from the first 7 or 8 episodes were good enough for me to watch with close attention, an 8 score anime. But then it started to get pretty dull. And the ending (episodes 12 and 13) was just terrible. Typical shounen mambo jambo, full of meaningless catchphrases, heroes who show up in the right time and plot holes: several plot holes. Also, I did not feel I was watching a horror series, even with all the decapitations, rape and...japanese ghost folclore dialogues.Despite the general disappointment, I do not consider KHM a waste of time. It was OK, a 6 score anime. The art has some pretty neet stuff, especially on the backgrounds, and the voicing was acceptable. I cannot remember the quality of the soundtrack, so I'll just assume it was powerless.The main characters are also a problem in KHM. Not one of them did I find loveble, not because they're all archetypes, but because the producers did not have the hability to turn those archetypes into delicious characters. Also, I found very predictable and tiring the inclusion of a naggin' female character with large boobs.So, in conclusion, if you want to watch a horror anime and you don't feel like watching Gantz or Shigurui, I guess you can watch this. But do not expect much more than a FINE (6) show. japanese ghost folclore dialogues.Despite the general disappointment, I do not consider KHM a waste of time. It was OK, a 6 score anime.

Yamaoka Momosuke is collecting research for a book he wishes to write, the titular ""Hundred stories."" And then the shows gets weird. He meets the mysterious Ongyou, attractive Ogin, big guy Nagamimi, and pint sized leader of the trio, Mataichi. They are basically, detectives, finding and purging evil spirits and the like from the land. And Momosuke can\'t seem to quit running into them. It basically follows a typical monster of the week scenario until near the shows end, which i won\'t spoil here. The art style is...rather surreal. Buildings, walls, and even people seem distorted and wavy. It almost made me turn it off, but i stayed and watched anyway. The story is pretty simple, real episodic for a while. One of the things that hooked me (besides Ogin. Me-ow.) is Steve Kramer as Mataichi. His voice fits the character perfectly. I should warn you though, this show is NOT for the kiddies. It gets real violent and gory as the show goes on. Overall, if you have some time to kill, and want to see a rather surreal and strange anime, check out Hundred stories.

He is called the ‘Trickster’ by his team-mates. He refers to Momosuke by calling him Mr. Author. He is a charm-caster by profession, who sells talismans to people. He is a mysterious short guy who resembles a mummy by looks and always carries a staff, like a priest. His behavior is depicted as that of a calm-minded, quiet and reserved gentleman, who doesn’t like to talk much. He likes to eat and is taunted by his fellow team-mate, Ogin every now and then for his mysterious and unpredictable nature. Every episode ends with Mataichi’s words of Wisdom echoing in the atmosphere, which are brought to a full-stop with this phrase: ‘To the other world, we commit thee’.

He always keeps smiling, which makes him look weirder than he already is. He is pictured as a tall and stout man with a good muscular physique who always carries a long pipe with him in his mouth. He has the duty to act as the medium that brings the entire case in the light.• Tsutaya: He is a small chubby creature who is Momosuke’s publisher. At the start, he Is shown to be pissed by the change in the decision of Momosuke to stop writing the riddles for children, but later, he agrees to aid the protagonist in his work.• Heihachi: He is the co-worker of Momosuke.• Hermits:o Black Hermito White HermitThese two hermit ladies work as the messengers of an entity names Kyogoku Tei, who is supposedly the boss of the Ongyou, whose identity remains under the shrouds till the end.

They are accidentally destroyed by the main antagonist in the last episode.• Tatsuta: She is a young lady who has the record of killing her childhood friend Shiragaku out of jealousy of her love for her would be husband. She thus earns the name of a witch, ‘Hi-No-Enma’ who is rumored to kill anybody who loves Shiragaku.

This is an anthology series so each episode contains a new story with new characters (except for last 2 or 3 episodes), all tied together with an overarching story about an author who bumps into a trio of beings? Who go around Japan to exorcise spirits that have committed sin.So honestly, the characters weren't that memorable except maybe Mataichi and the animation style could be somewhat off putting as they mixed traditional anime style with 3d textures at some points. However the anime was strong where...it mattered most and that was the story/ies. The episodic stories had some great plot twists and grotesque imagery that worked really well with some of the horrifying story details. Some of my favourites include The Willow Woman and The Floating head as well as Salty Chouji. The ending of the anime was also great.The anime is quite short and I don't think minor criticisms should affect you watching it so if you are a horror fan with the taste for some great short horror stories, I would recommend this series.

That is the plot in a nutshell, and at times it feels like that is all that the show is on a basic level, and episodes survived based off of how well they executed this premise, and in how bizarre and unique the visuals were pushed. Episodes varied a bit for me, some being really good and memorable, while others were dull and faded to...give way to the more interesting ones, a few even feeling derivative of each other. While never painful, after watching enough I guessed the format by episode 4 and it never broke, each episode is about a crime of a broken, deranged person, some of whom are more memorable, entertaining or sympathetic than others, but each has committed a heinous crime in some capacity and has blamed a yokai or specter for the atrocities preformed, and in most cases it is the person most staunchly against it being the work of the supernatural that is the perpetrator. The episode always takes time to flesh out and humanize these individuals in some capacity, and each has a unique enough design that they don\'t blend together.Of course no discussion of this show would be complete without bringing up the visuals. The Art-style is unique, and despite numerous locals, characters, and set designs all looking radically different the show never suffers, and each of these blend together to enhance the experience, elevating the mood and tone of each scene and the show as a whole, complimenting its tone and themes with the unnerving imagery as opposed to subverting or dismantling it.However Kyougoku Natsuhiko: Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari is an anime that I find difficult to properly articulate as being either traditionally good or bad, its not that that the pros and cons overlap, its just that both are very present, and for everything that I loved, their was something else that I found to be a bit more difficult to get me through an episode, and now that I\'ve gone over the good, its time for the bad, and the most distracting aspect was how the main protagonist often felt like he was out of the loop, and inconsistent in his place in the narrative; in one episode he is entirely in the loop about the Ongyou being denizens of the afterlife, yet later on he is completely baffled by such a concept and is a stark skeptic. More than anything it feels like information is withheld not for the sake of adding to the narrative or tone, but instead to confound Momosuke who comes across as dense, at best, for not putting 2and2 together on multiple occasions and needing to be guided through similar concepts constantly, while at others he is suddenly a super genius who can easily deduce what the Ongyou could not despite many decades worth of experience in investigating conspiracies and knowledge of the next world to aid them and usually with nothing but a lucky find and equally lucky guess. Meanwhile the Ongyou come across as inept in their desire to protect the young author from the dangers that they face, purposely keeping him out of the loop, and inadvertently sending him to greater danger of putting him in their way for no other reason than poor communication between the two parties.I\'d say watch it if you are more for strong visuals and villains, and be prepared for a fair amount of cringe in the narrative whenever things start to feel too convoluted. give way to the more interesting ones, a few even feeling derivative of each other.

Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34607/Lostorage_Conflated_WIXOSS,"['Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS FINALLY finishes off this anime about high school girls battling each other with cards for memories and wishes to a fitting conclusion...ALOT of people were divided over incited WIXOSS for bringing in new rules as well the the villains given, however Conflated gave a newer spin and an even more interesting element to the finale of this series...Selector Infected WIXOSS and Lostorage\'s cast mingle together!No seriously that in itself was a great idea and even the diverging cast members fighting each other would have been an interesting scenario which it pulled off. As such Lostorage\'s new sets of battles set up by...Carnival where all the characters from both series to clash with one another with new rules...if you lose, you lose your LRIG. Because there are new battles, that means some notion of motivation as to the new and old characters, Lostorage\'s Suzuko voiced by Chinami Hashimoto trying to get back Chinatsu\'s memories back and Selector\'s Ruuko voiced once again by Ai Kakuma to get back Tama after some complicated turn of events. The rest of the expansive cast have their motives to battle which kinda goes back to their character development of the series they originated from, but if there was one TRUE protagonist in Conflated, that would have been Kiyoi Mizushima voiced by Saori Oonishi and LA\'s favorite character because of how much development we got from her, not to mention it MADE sense for Kiyoi to be the true protagonist, being in both Selector and Lostorage battles as both a LRIG and a human in the process of it all.Kiyoi goes through the most character development in this season, with having knowing of her days as a LRIG before and after Selector infected, her connection the the new Piruluk who was once a best friend of Kiyoi after her LRIG days, as well as MANY of the opponents trying to get revenge at her (like Aoi Akira) which feels poetic to say the least as well as her connection to the ""room"" and Mayu, LA could easily see why Kiyoi got the most screentime this season and was well worth it knowing what was once a satellite character having soo much importance in the plot and ultimately Kiyoi wanting to stop the battles for GOOD this time.Ruuko and Suzuko does have importance in the plot like LA said, like of getting Chinatsu\'s memories and Tama back, but Ruuko and Suzuko\'s group also ties up loose ends in each of their series\' character plot as well, though not as much as Ruuko\'s though because we get the basic ""get the group back together LRIG or otherwise"" while Suzuko and Chinatsu\'s relationship grows back by the end of it. Though LA will say that Ruuko\'s group development stems from concluding Mayu\'s story while having some small sense of character conclusion and motives from Ruuko\'s side. So mingling both cast of characters and their interaction if anything is probably the best thing about this season and how each character helps with the other as well.Once again the animation done by JC Staff was typical of Lostorage atmosphere, both being colorful and impactful with it\'s Selector battles while adding some good atmospheric animation to make the animation decent enough. Really it\'s typical Lostorage animation from backgrounding to battles and quirky character designs (both human and LRIG).Voice acting was great as well with Saori Oonishi being the MVP of it all like LA said above about Kiyoi, however there is a lesser sense of ""batshit crazy characters"", you\'d think Yuka Iguchi going bleak dark crazy was something, Carnival voiced by...KANA ASUMI (WHAT!??!?!?!) and new Layla voiced by Akari Kito & Reina Kondou (long story) were good substitutes for the batshit crazy, though they were the majorly focused villians for this season nonetheless...great cast all things considering both Selector and Lostorage\'s cast coming together.Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS may have newer rules as well as adding in past cast members, but for what it was worth LA enjoyed Conflated all throughout this season, as getting to know Kiyoi more and more as well as concluding and resolving not only Selector Infected series but Lostorage series by it\'s characters were definitive pluses in LA\'s books that kept LA interested and sure it\'s an anime about girls fighting for wishes and memories in a card battle but Conflated helped immensely in it\'s character focused department for this to be more of a story of stopping a cycle more than ""card games battle""...as LA can easily say that though Lostorage is an advertisement for cards but with a bleak atmosphere about it, but by NOW you can see that Lostorage was more of a plot and character focused story than an advertisement of card games.Lostorage Conflated WIXOSS finally ended the cycle and tied up ALL it\'s loose ends and did it in a grand and satisfying conclusion and an anime FINALLY ending is quite something...even from a ""card game sourced"" adaptation.Let\'s just hope this really is the finale of the franchise, otherwise the above statement will be meaningless if this isn\'t the end. Lostorage and by extensions JC Staff...please leave a good thing in a good light and not spoil it by continuing it...

Lostorage and by extensions JC Staff...please leave a good thing in a good light and not spoil it by continuing it...', 'Now when I first started watching the Wixoss series, it was a fresh air in terms of a card game anime. Sure it had it moments where it tries too hard to be Madoka, but it was ok. Season 3 came in and it tried way too hard to be dark, resulting with every character being stupid and crying for dumb reasons.With season 4 here, I can safely say that it\'s a major improvement over season 3. I\'ll be looking at this anime mostly as a card game anime and a bit as Madoka because it\'s pretty important with how I feel about this season.Let\'s...start off with pros.-The thing that I liked about the first two seasons is that it sort of tries to acknowledge how card game players act in real life with card shops, playing casually with friends, and using some mind/strategy tricks against opponents which I dealt with before. Season 3 threw all that away.With Season 4, it did none of what the previous seasons did. Maybe a little of Season 3. They decided to go all out Yugioh with the whole Shadow Realm nonsense. You know what I\'m talking about, card games to the death. Loser goes to the Shadow Realm. I know it\'s not called that, but it got that vibe.I was laughing my ass off when I realize this was the route they were going with. It had the same amount of nonsense and silliness as the original Yugioh with how the new rules turned Wixoss from a Madoka game to the Shadow Games. Then they elements like characters turning into card characters or cards just like in the original Yugioh. I mean dear lord, the nostalgia and insanity.-The original characters coming back. While they are not the best characters ever, they are at least likable. Freaking Tama amp up the cuteness with her bubbly attitude and it\'s just so cute. We even get to see what the characters have been doing for a while.The sad part is that they aren\'t seen as much as the Season 3 character which I\'ll get to later. Overall, I like these characters coming back and their scenes.-Some of the plot points were definitely better than Season 3 as there is a mystery that is not hammered down your throat and actually gives nice cliffhangers and all. I felt encouraged to watch a new episode and not have to do it just because.-Lastly, it\'s finally over! The whole nonsense with this card game is over. Sure we might be spin offs like Wixoss GX, Wixoss 5ds, Wixoss Zexal, Wixoss Arc V, or Wixoss Vrains, but we finally end the cycle of despair for these girls.Now to the cons which is kind of sad since the season itself was doing okay except it continues from season 3 which is it\'s major flaw.-The season 3 characters only wised up a bit. I can understand their motivations and feelings this time because their responses to the situations were more natural per say. However, they are the ones we spend to most screen time with and they barely interact with the original characters. They got a chance to talk, but they don\'t. When they do, it\'s a bit satisfying but I wish to see more since it was promoted to happen in this season. However, the season 3 characters just comes off as more boring than stupid this time with their own trading cards being the more interesting characters than their owner. And that\'s when you realize that this anime have characters who have less of a personality than a piece of card board. I just board with the season 3 characters is all. However, I only got pissed off with one character this time unlike season 3 and I\'ll tell you more when I get to the main villains.-The game made no sense anymore. Often times, I felt that they are breaking the rules even though I never played the game before. At least with Yugioh, they only cheat through top decking (Heart of the cards) or reading the description of the card wrong. Here, they just did whatever they wanted, mostly the villains. The main characters tried to play fair at least, but they had their fair share of BS that are only as severe as Yugioh. The main villains however are flat out cheaters. They got special power ups and all that made no sense and just win just because. Like they got this one attack that\'s a one hit KO with no explanation and this ultimate power or whatever. Hell, the main villain even stated that who ever started these games gave him these cheat codes which pisses me off more. Some of the battles do not feel satisfying as it\'s often the villains who made really BS moves and they act like they got skill which comes off as arrogant and stupid in my eyes. This anime cheats way more than Yugioh to the point where not even money can allow them to screw the rules.-The main villains in this anime are flat out closed-minded and very stupid cheaters. The foes in the season are not bad as I did sort of like Aki Lucky as a villain while being interesting. The main villain which was Carnival is not. Season 3 has her previous owner being stupid with no idea whether to be a subtle or not. Here, she is a cheater and all of her battles is just her cheating. There were times where I would say ""Judge!"" or have the feeling of calling the cops. Remember when I said that the season got insane with Yugioh logic, this character kind of downplays it with her appearance and it really shows in the later half of the season. She tries to ruin what\'s fun in this anime because of her views of what\'s fun.Then you have that fact that Carnival thinks that everyone likes to be in this Death Game and thinks it\'s a paradise and wants to keep having fun. That is very closed-minded and stupid. Have she ever consider the fact that humanity is capable of being compassionate enough to not murder someone, especially in a card game. While some of us wants to play for fun! And if you made this world wide, eventually everyone will die from your constant cheating and you\'ll get bored since everyone is dead and you got no one to play with. God, I cringe when I see this character being so stupid. I\'m glad that she was defeated in the end.Then you get the person in charge and the final battle is just a mess. Kiyoi, one of the characters, said it best which is that it\'s not Wixoss anymore. Just senseless fighting with no rhyme or reason. Also if you need to have a card game tournament, it does not need death in it. At least give it a prize worth winning other than living with nothing gained.-Overall, this anime has it\'s ups and downs. While there is some good, there are some bad countering it sadly. I definitely recommend this season if you grew up with the original Yugioh as it has the same amount of insanity when it can. start off with pros.-The thing that I liked about the first two seasons is that it sort of tries to acknowledge how card game players act in real life with card shops, playing casually with friends, and using some mind/strategy tricks against opponents which I dealt with before.

Here in Lostorage Conflated Wixoss the rules have...change that us audience can easily get lost as what gives about such Wixoss game where as it\'s title suggested Lostorage Conflated Wixoss were the cast of Wixoss of the selector series gets combine with the cast of the Lostorage series has basically added some conflict when the rules and as to why Akira just disappeared without becoming a LIRG herself and when Kiyoi has already beaten Carnival who was supposed to be Kiyoi\'s bitch starts to take advantage of biting her hand by siding with that  LRIG of Beginnings........That\'s the white girl whom Kiiyoi fought in the last episode , right? Anyways, combining the characters from the Wixoss series was good, but the enjoyable part was seeing Kou Satomi / Carnival get beaten by Kiyoi , and Ruko getting to owned Kaede but as I watched this sequel I\'m just basically getting lost about them LIRG of the selector series with that of the Lostarge series, just making this review already making me go nuts about how each LIRG were related to whose holder, then again the part were we see the LIRG of beginnings getting owned by a leveled up Kiyoi / Piruluk does give this Wixoss series a ""VERY GOOD"" ending and seeing them LRIG becoming the memories of the slector who lost from previous battles was touching  , btw did someone notices a Amika look alike on the ending post credits , ya know a LIRG Amika who somehow becomes a human Amika twin of sorts. Ya know, I\'m starting to go nuts, so here are the lowdowns of my review:Story- Poor 3: It may be good the the two series of Wixoss were combined, but, IMAO it adds to my conflications about those other LIRG not owned by the main characters.Art- Mediocre 5: Cu\'z its the same illustration design, the same LIRGs, the same Characters, except in the selector series we get to see Ruko and her gang sport the Sr High School uniform that makes them hot.Sound-Mediocre 5: Do I need to say more considering that it the same voice actors who did the character\'s voice.Character- Very Good 6:We can safely say that this is Kiyoi\'s moment  and in fact she was able to owned the LIRG of beginnings, Carnival, and Akira was something else.Enjoyment- fair 6: since I\'m having a hard time of understanding about the other LIRG\'s. the rules to the battles and the conflicts that somehow I was unable to wrap my head around it.Overall-Good 7: Well , since this is where the Wixoss franchise ends , for its anime setting, I just see it as just ""GOOD"" enough, when this anime has a lot of short cuts and somehow rushed, frankly, I just don\'t see any point that this anime should be very good when the selector series has to be combined with the lostorage series, I mean they should have just continued with the lostarge series since the selector series  has a clean ending. So I hope     JC Staff doesn\'t start another spin off and then combine it with the other two series that would add to such complications.  BATTLE !!!!!!! change that us audience can easily get lost as what gives about such Wixoss game where as it\'s title suggested Lostorage Conflated Wixoss were the cast of Wixoss of the selector series gets combine with the cast of the Lostorage series has basically added some conflict when the rules and as to why Akira just disappeared without becoming a LIRG herself and when Kiyoi has already beaten Carnival who was supposed to be Kiyoi\'s bitch starts to take advantage of biting her hand by siding with that  LRIG of Beginnings........That\'s the white girl whom Kiiyoi fought in the last episode , right?

Majutsushi Orphen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1017/Majutsushi_Orphen,"[""Orphen is not something that will leave you thinking you just watched one of the greatest animes of all time. It's a good fantasy story presented in a nice way. The opening statement might sound negative but it's better to be blunt about it, it's not.The story is enjoyable and the best thing about the anime. Some nice changes to pretty common story elements make Orphen get a story that is good and solid. The mix of humorus sceens and action and battle scenes it done very well and in a way that helps the story along and doesn't feel like it has been put...there just for the heck of it. There are fightscenes but they are generaly not long. They are far from the battles of animes such as Dragon Ball or Bleach where they stretch on for several episodes with one episode dedicated to the yelling needed to power up. If you are a fan of these battles I whould not recomend Orphen to you for it's fight scenes. The battles mostly over after a few strikes. If you have read the Lord of the Rings trillogy you can expect the battles to be much in the same way when it comes to presentation. More focus on what happens before and after a fight than the actuall battle. They are not overly short but no longer than they need to be since they are not the main focus of the story. That is the hunt for the relics needed to transform Azalie back to her normal form before the Tower of Fang (called Talon`s Peak in the story synopsis) can kill her.I like the art style of this anime. You can see that it's not a very new anime by just looking at it but with a fantasy story it doesn't hurt to think old. The backgrounds are detailed without having any real details. It might sound odd but it's the best way I can describe it. Everything has a good amount of colours in diffrent shades. Grass and stone are not one colour with another shade for shadows and highlights. They are done in the same style as paintings or the old disney films.The characters are done in the three shades way mentioned above with the addition of another colour for lighting effects and fit very good onto the background.The magic spells could have done with some more detail, they are very simply drawn but then it's pretty hard to add shadows to something that glows strong enough to make make all other shadows look weak.The characters fullfill their roles very well even if they are very sterotypical in most cases. Despite that they are fun and fit into the story and they don't feel to sterotypical untill you start to analyze them. It whould have been fun to see a bit more character development from Majic and a bit more so from Cleo. It whould have been fun looking back at the anime but nothing I found myself thinking about while watching it. The others are done nicely enough.The soundtrack did what it's supposed to. Be in the back but wasn't very intresting with the exeption of one track which was great. I also liked the opening and closing songs especially the closing ones. More personal taste than anything else in this case I'd guess since they are pretty standard. You'll like or love them while you watch but forget them after a while when they get replaced by the next thing you watch.I whould highly recomend it to people who want to watch a good fantasy anime that has a good mix of story development, action and humor.If you want a anime with lot's of actions and battles or a very deep and serious (in terms of theme) anime you should continue your search.If you are looking for something good to watch in general, you could could easily do worse than watch Sorcerous Stabber Orphen.Also for those who are not to elitist to watch dubbed anime. The english dubs are good. there just for the heck of it. There are fightscenes but they are generaly not long. They are far from the battles of animes such as Dragon Ball or Bleach where they stretch on for several episodes with one episode dedicated to the yelling needed to power up.

Grass and stone are not one colour with another shade for shadows and highlights. They are done in the same style as paintings or the old disney films.The characters are done in the three shades way mentioned above with the addition of another colour for lighting effects and fit very good onto the background.The magic spells could have done with some more detail, they are very simply drawn but then it's pretty hard to add shadows to something that glows strong enough to make make all other shadows look weak.The characters fullfill their roles very well even if they are very sterotypical in most cases. Despite that they are fun and fit into the story and they don't feel to sterotypical untill you start to analyze them. It whould have been fun to see a bit more character development from Majic and a bit more so from Cleo. It whould have been fun looking back at the anime but nothing I found myself thinking about while watching it. The others are done nicely enough.The soundtrack did what it's supposed to. Be in the back but wasn't very intresting with the exeption of one track which was great. I also liked the opening and closing songs especially the closing ones. More personal taste than anything else in this case I'd guess since they are pretty standard. You'll like or love them while you watch but forget them after a while when they get replaced by the next thing you watch.I whould highly recomend it to people who want to watch a good fantasy anime that has a good mix of story development, action and humor.If you want a anime with lot's of actions and battles or a very deep and serious (in terms of theme) anime you should continue your search.If you are looking for something good to watch in general, you could could easily do worse than watch Sorcerous Stabber Orphen.Also for those who are not to elitist to watch dubbed anime.

The storyline and ideas behind it, are amazingly well done but i think if they put some more dramatic moments (not the cheesy ones) it'd bring more attention. either way, over all, i'd say an 8 sounds good. the 2 points that are really missing are the lack of character development for cleo and maybe Orphens apprentice. but other than that, i'd recommend this anime to people who arent into...a very deep story line. a very deep story line."", ""This will be my first review. At this moment, I believe that I would have the right eyesight to review and critique an anime considering the amount I have watched. Also, the fact that I was just too lazy to write one. :P Well just bare with me.Majutsushi Orphen...  Hmmm. You can always read the description that MAL gives you but it doesn't do the anime any justice towards its story whatsoever. It has a somewhat deeper demeanor that gives the viewer a new way to view the world around them.Considering from other anime series, this one is one of the best classic...anime that is possibly unknown to most people (even though there is a PS2 game for the series that came to the US). In my opinion, it brought upon the stigma of 90's anime which mostly consisted of action, adventure oriented material. One of the main reasons that it is a good anime to watch is if you get tired of watching romantic and slow paced anime then this is a nice change of pace. Another reason is that it goes beyond just the fight scenes and into what is really important which would be why people act the way they do.The sound and art of the anime are exactly what one would expect from the 90's. The only qualms I have is that the soundtrack was good but I wouldnt say it was spectacular by any means whatsoever. The artwork on the other hand was well done. Especially the backgrounds that were placed in each episode.Overall, it is an anime to watch but be mindful of some of the characters. In my opinion, be open-minded since at some point there might be ones that you either enjoy or dislike.

It has a really nice feel to it and pulls at your emotions well. The light hearted emotions they have in it only help keep the show from becoming to dark. Though the artwork is rather vintage and has small hiccups sometimes, it is still a very good series of anime.I love how Orphen acts even though he can be pretty much a jerk. He doesn’t take a lot of things seriously except what he actually deams worth his time. He’s shrud and stand-offish though he really does care about the other characters. Magik is pretty much like a cluts though...he is a ladies man even when he doesn’t try. He’s gentle and sweet, always caring about others. Cleo is well… mostly a brat, though she does grow the most in the show. She first starts out rather like a spoiled brat and then slowly warms up to Orphen. I do like her pushy attitude and her go get ‘um personality but sometimes I think she is way too hard of Orphen.The storyline is a bit odd though and feels a bit like they have a lot of filler. For a lot of the time, it seemed like only side quests even though we already knew the story line and what it would lead up to. I like when it leads up to giving us the bigger picture instead of telling us all at once.The animation is rather vintage, just a bit grainy though the colors are soft and perfectly shows the characters. It’s almost like your looking threw a very light fog and makes the artwork even more beautiful. I do have a problem with the name screen as it is in poor 3D animation.

It doesn\'t stray far from it\'s genre, which in this case I don\'t really mind. It isn\'t trying to be more than it should be. However, that doesn\'t mean that it is a good series. Overall the series is slightly above average and has alot of the standard cliches that you would expect from a series in this genre.The series stays close to the typical ""I\'m going to save the one I love"" story. It isn\'t anything spectacular at first glance, but it does it\'s job pretty well by creating a goal and purpose for our main cast....I did appreciate the little twists in the plot, but it wasn\'t anything that will blow you away. Sometimes I even felt that it was executed and handled poorly.The series explained parts of the story though the use of flashbacks, which I didn\'t really mind. The flashbacks were pretty well placed and it didn\'t made the viewer forget about the events in the present. The ending was predictable, but I didn\'t expect anything major or groundbreaking.The story had it\'s fun moments, but when you look at the big picture it was mediocre at best.The series dates back to 1998 and it showed when looking at the art. The art was dated, but is wasn\'t irritating to look at. The background were for the most part pretty dull and dark, but at the beginning of the series it looked very refreshing and sometimes beautifull. The character design were pretty cool, but the overuse of robes for most characters didn\'t give them any uniqueness in design and appearance-wise.The sound is this series strongest point. There wasn\'t much OST which I didn\'t like and it fitted really well in the many scenes, but the different OST were starting to get overused as times past on. Both openings were really catchy and nice to listen to. The endings were average in my opinion. The voice actors did their jobs as they should have done. They all sounded allright and they could convey the emotions in a good way.The characters were a downside for me. Our main cast got hardly any development through the series. At first I had high hopes for our main character Orphen, but he slowly began to feel like your typical shonen character which dissapointed me. Majic didn\'t change in a way or form. Cleao was the only main character with some development, but it wasn\'t anything big.The series also had a comedic duo consisting of the brothers Volcan and Dortin. This kind of comedy is normally a hit or miss and in mine case it was a miss. It didn\'t make me laugh and because of the repetitiveness, I started to get irritated by our ""comedic"" duo.The villians were pretty shallow in my opinion. It was very confusing at the end what actually the main reasoning behind their goals were.In the end, I did enjoy this series in a way. The twists in the story and the nice music gave me the motivation to keep watching and see what happened next. The poor character development and overall predictable and mediocre story made me almost drop it, but in a way I\'m happy that I continued to watch it.I wouldn\'t reccomend this immediatly when someone wants to watch a series in this genre, but I would advise you to check it out when you have some spare time.

How many lives did she ruin? she well deserved to be killed, such a stupid entitled brat.The two dwarves - if there was such a thing as cancer characters in a story - these two are just that, they\'re the annoyance incarnate, their only role in the story is to just cause troubles and be utterly insufferable, I simply hate them.The sound is generic and repetitive - there is a sound effect of a dragon\'s cry that is used like 30 to 40 times throughout the anime, always the same effect repeated, so frigging annoying, considering it takes so little work to alter the same sound effect just a little so not make it sound exactly the same shows just how crappy was the sound director here,shame on him/her.The only good thing about the sound is the ending music ""Last Kiss"" which is the only thing I remembered of this anime when I watched it in the late 90\'sThe art direction is awful, God knows just how much I hate stereotypical ambience to try to improve the pathos of emotions in a scene - why the stupid damn moon is always full when it\'s needed to be in the shot? why in that episode there are like 30 thunder sounds in 30 seconds just to accommodate the drama of the moment? why Orphen in that episode have to walk all the way to the end of a cliff to stare at the sunset?

This is an anime worth watching."", 'After having watched all of the 1998 adaptation of Orphen, I felt compelled to sign up for MAL in an attempt to articulate my own review of this series. While this is by no means a perfect series, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this first season. Little did I know that this would become such a lengthy review.The majority of anime that I have watched is more recent, from around 2010 and onwards. I knew that this being a bit of an older series, there may be some things that are more dated. But this anime really worked for me. In...my opinion, it highlights some of the best things from the 90s era of anime: art, sound/music, hand drawn animation, and comedic charm.Ok, so the story isn\'t something we\'ve never heard of before. Protagonist embarks on a quest to fulfill a certain goal. But it\'s all about the journey! The episodes start off as primarily self-contained, but they build into a larger plot. (one that I will not go into detail about because, y\'know, spoilers)The art and animation are on point when it\'s considered a priority. Unfortunately, there are a few episodes where the art and animation are noticeably inconsistent. But when these two necessities are given the due care that they deserve, it was a beauty for me to look at. Especially the character art for our main leads.For the Japanese dub, I found no issues with the sound. I especially enjoyed the different sound tracks that were used for the different tones of the show. Azalie\'s theme was probably my favorite. Both openings were solid with some great animation. The endings were nice, poppy bits that sort of softened whatever action/drama had taken place earlier in the episode. Character acting was nicely done, too. As for the English dub, I have come to understand that this was at one time a divisive topic. I can understand why. This anime received quite a few critiques for having parts of the script changed. This particularly happened a lot in the first twelve episodes. And there were a few times where I even found that off-putting. Like, why change the initial reason for why Cleao decided to join  Orphen and Majic? And yet, there was something that kept me coming back to the dub. Maybe it was a curiosity to see what they would change this time? But I also will say that I think the script changes worked for the comedic bits. And the character acting, for the most part, charmed me. I\'ll admit that Cleao and Majic took a little bit of getting used to. But I felt like the dub actors acted their hearts out to portray their version of these characters. It became fun for me to compare the two different language versions. Where I take issue with the English dub is that there were times where the volume for a character in a scene was so quiet that I had to go back and replay that moment more than a couple times just to hear what was said. (Hopefully that\'s not my hearing becoming an issue.)Ok, characters. For me, this was probably where Orphen wasn\'t as strong. I wish that a few of our more prominent characters received a bit more development. Not to say that there is no character development. And I\'m sure a lot of people found the Volkan and Dortin scenes to be more annoying than anything else. Somehow, I didn\'t mind the two trolls. Also, Hartia is precious and must be protected at all costs. Orphen\'s development was handled really nicely. I came to really like him as a character. And even bratty Cleao became someone endearing.Even though this anime has its flaws, my overall enjoyment was a 10. I finished all 24 episodes of this first season in both subbed and dubbed in one week. That\'s technically 48 episodes. Now for some, I know that\'s mere pocket change. But for me, that\'s a fast consumption rate. I laughed. I...might have cried. Bopped my head to some of the music. Also, without giving spoilers, I had a ""wtf"" moment with the resolution for one character at the end. It forced my hand to dock a point.If you don\'t find yourself enjoying the first five episodes, then this probably isn\'t an anime you want to continue.

And the character acting, for the most part, charmed me. I\'ll admit that Cleao and Majic took a little bit of getting used to. But I felt like the dub actors acted their hearts out to portray their version of these characters. It became fun for me to compare the two different language versions. Where I take issue with the English dub is that there were times where the volume for a character in a scene was so quiet that I had to go back and replay that moment more than a couple times just to hear what was said. (Hopefully that\'s not my hearing becoming an issue.)Ok, characters. For me, this was probably where Orphen wasn\'t as strong. I wish that a few of our more prominent characters received a bit more development. Not to say that there is no character development. And I\'m sure a lot of people found the Volkan and Dortin scenes to be more annoying than anything else. Somehow, I didn\'t mind the two trolls. Also, Hartia is precious and must be protected at all costs. Orphen\'s development was handled really nicely. I came to really like him as a character. And even bratty Cleao became someone endearing.Even though this anime has its flaws, my overall enjoyment was a 10. I finished all 24 episodes of this first season in both subbed and dubbed in one week. That\'s technically 48 episodes. Now for some, I know that\'s mere pocket change. But for me, that\'s a fast consumption rate. I laughed. I...might have cried. Bopped my head to some of the music. Also, without giving spoilers, I had a ""wtf"" moment with the resolution for one character at the end. It forced my hand to dock a point.If you don\'t find yourself enjoying the first five episodes, then this probably isn\'t an anime you want to continue. But man, I got a kick out of Orphen!']"
Mutafukaz,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38292/Mutafukaz,"['Do you know what the best anime movie of the last couple years is? I\'ll give you a hint: it\'s nothing by Makoto Shinkai, the Tyler Perry  of anime. It\'s probably this one.Let\'s talk about anime movies for a second. There are three kinds of original anime movies:A. ghibliB. Over-produced trashy teen romances for the lowest common denominator that could\'ve been live actionC. The rare, totally stand-alone anime film that dares to take full advantage of the medium and delivers art, animation and story concepts that would\'ve never been possible in a TV series format.This movie, MFKZ, is solidly in group C. This...is a Movie with a bold, capital M, and it\'s one of my biggest contenders for favorite movie of last year. Not just anime movie, not just animated movie, favorite Movie. It\'s bold, insane, beautiful, fun and encapsulates everything cool about anime and animation in general. It\'s fucking awesome. Of course, only like 10 people know it exists.However, maybe that will change because it\'s ~ ~ NOW ON NETFLIX ~ ~, and this review is goin\' up to tell you why you should watch it like two or eight times.Let\'s dig in.MFKZ is a Japanese movie that is based on a French comic, based heavily around American culture and mythos - There\'s really nothing else like it, it is a wholly unique experience in this dead-dry industry full of perpetual garbage that\'s spun off or mutated from other garbage.The first thing you notice in this weird mishmash of a visual feast is, well, the visuals. If you\'ve seen the trailer, or even any screenshots, you\'ll notice that this movie doesn\'t look like anything else out there, except for Tekkonkinkreet, which you likely also haven\'t seen (but should.) Character designs vary wildly from realistically proportioned to being complete caricatures or talking animals. These designs all do something only animation can do: directly reflect the characters\' personalities or just be generally absurd. This is all played completely straight - the main character\'s best friend has a flaming skull for a head, and this is acknowledged and played up in certain scenes, but there\'s never any ""explanation"" - he\'s just like that. Born that way.The show-stopper here though is the background artwork. Every scene in this movie is beautiful. Every single shot. Close up of dirty bathroom tile? Drawn by God damned Rembrandt. All the time. Every mundane thing is meticulously brought to life and depicted with personality in extreme detail.And then when it\'s all combined together, you get one of the most fluidly animated, stylishly directed animated movies of all time. What Into the Spiderverse did for 3DCG movies, this film does for 2D. The ice cream truck chase (yes, correct) sequence alone redefined what I thought was possible in an animated sequence, featuring wild camera shifts, time slowdowns and speedups, and just all-around cooky action.Next, I guess we can talk about the story. I\'ve had friends and people on forums say to me that the story is confusing. This movie isn\'t that complicated: it\'s an action movie. The main kids beat up the bad guys and chase after the girl, it\'s very Hollywood Blockbuster Action. That summary is definitely a simplification, but MFKZ takes you through a pretty linear chain of events and explains everything to you as it happens. The insane visuals and the fact the movie doesn\'t spoonfeed this to you is where people are getting hung up.  One of the cool things about this film is that the main characters are total losers - destitute, incompetent, weak everymen living in a bad apartment in a bad city. There are several other parties hunting them down and aiding them, and while our main boy is the catalyst for a lot of things, the bigger events that transpire barely involve him. He just gets hit by the dump truck from Sonic Adventure 2 and then dodges lunatics with bullets while fawning over a girl. That\'s him. Then you have the demons, the mafia hitmen, the scientist, the roaches, the Shakespearian gangman played by the RZA, and the fucking luchadores. They all sort of crash together to make the final act happen, and the main boy is just there, sorting out his literal personal demons, not there to save the world. It\'s refreshing and everything has a payoff, coming together seamlessly for a strong finale. I\'ve seen much weirder, much worse in movies than this. MFKZ is very tight from start to finish, not a scene or shot is wasted and everything contributes to the narrative.Last, let\'s have a look at the audio in this movie. The English voice cast, the only relevant voice cast, is just stellar. This movie was made to be in English, voiced by Americans. You have have a pretty strong who\'s who of famous TV actors filling out the cast, like villain dude from Breaking Bad and the guy from The Shield. Performances are stellar all around, delivering fun, witty dialogue that feels like real people are talking, rather than the usual Google Translated dub scripts. ""Shinohara-san, will you go to the Obenkyo Dojaimazisu with me?"" / ""Nnn-hn! Y-yes, big brother, I will! It makes me so happy!"" - no shit like that, you hear?The soundtrack and general sound design are quite solid. Not a lot of memorable vocal BGM or anything, but sometimes you\'ll get an insane dubstep drop beat during an action sequence. Essentially, the sound in the movie is very much design to emphasize the action and mood, rather than be any kind of flashy distraction. It\'s a good, simple sauce on a complicated dish.So yeah, go watch it. You probably have a couple months before it\'s arbitrarily rotated. And then go watch Promare, Lu Over the Wall, Night is Short Walk on Girl, Tekkonkinkreet, the works of Satoshi Kon, and all the other incredible original anime movies you slept on due to Director-san McSparkleskies hogging the spotlight. is a Movie with a bold, capital M, and it\'s one of my biggest contenders for favorite movie of last year.

Watch the English version. its more proper to the story it take placeWhen...it comes to the plot and narrative which i need to re-watch the film.

Its how they portrayed. I more likely ranting but ima make this quick and simple you can't just add voilent and bate the viewer by adding simple or cutie design or personality traits and smash them into piece.

But don't worry theres orchestrated tracks as well.First you get the redline 2009 then you the the devilmane and now you get the mutafukaz. You see where im getting at.

There were just around 20 people in the movie when I was watching it, so financially it may not have been that good for the cinema. Still for me it was worth it.Story (3/10):For me, the only bad thing about the movie was the story. Without doing any spoilers, it\'s just senseless and hilarious, especially in the second half of the movie. It fits to the movie in general, but some things just happen randomly...and you think ""why the hell is this part of the movie?"" or ""what\'s going on here? that doesn\'t make sense"". It\'s just hangling around from joke to joke without a proper point to reach at first, and everything is happening too fast to think about it some more. Well, the movie doesn\'t take itself too serious, so it\'s okay, but I didn\'t like it. The comical absurdity made me give it 3 points for story, otherwise a 2 or 1 would not have been far away...Art (7/10):The source material for the movie is a French comic strip, so don\'t expect an Asian art style here at all. Everyhing looks like a mixture between European and American culture (it plays in America somehow, so that\'s fine). It doesn\'t feel like an anime, more like a normal European animation movie. The animation is well-done and there are so much details in the pictures that you won\'t be able to get all at your first watch for sure.Sound (9/10):A cultural mixture of French hip-hop and house, and Latin music (for example Reggaeton). For me the best song was the Reggaeton song running during the credits. The songs perfectly fit to the background, but are completely different from most anime soundtracks. You may be disappointed if you like the pop/rock/metal-oriented soundtracks of Japanese anime movies.Character (7/10):Most characters in this movie didn\'t really make sense or were just hilariously exaggerated (clichès / stereotypes ahead!), which absolutely makes sense concerning the story. The two main characters are the only ones acting fairly normal. Sadly only one of the two gets a real characterization, while the second one acts more as a sidekick that stumbled into the whole thing by accident. Does he even have motives? We don\'t know...In addition to that, it\'s not explained why some of the protagonists look as they look. This may be some reference, too, but I didn\'t get it then.Enjoyment (9/10):I was just laughing all the time (except for the parts where I was thinking ""what the hell is going on here?""). The movie features lots and lots of Western cultural references. The humour of this movie is REALLY black. They don\'t fear to mock about anything: brand names, conspiracy theories, people, politics and many more. This is why the movie was so enjoyable for me, and I\'m sure I didn\'t find all the hints and references at first watch. Some senseless stuff made me sigh because I didn\'t find it funny, but the rest was really worth it.Overall: 6/10Well, I\'m sad that the story was not really fitting for me. The rest was very good and I would have given an 8/10, but this more or less patched story doesn\'t allow it. I gave a 6/10 because the movie overall is exactly what this number means: ""nice"".I recommend tha movie to everybody from a Western audience who wants to laugh about cultural jokes.

So turn your brain off, strap in and enjoy the crazy rollercoaster ride of super stylish action.As with all action flicks the story is more of an afterthought than anything else. The opening scenario was great and the set up with a flashback as the cold open was well done. However the film never goes anywhere with any of this despite the very dramatic and tense opening. It feels like a bunch of storyboards or comic panels...went missing during development. A deeper backstory is hinted at throughout and characters get dialogue that implies that there may be more going on but nothing ever comes of any of this By the end of the film nothing has really been learned and we arrive back at square 1 more or less. I genuinely think this is a shame because the scenario is very cool and the story actually had the potential to tell us something profound.The art and animation is simply gorgeous. The camera angles mixed with the fluid ultra violence, beautiful backdrops and fantastic character designs creates an animated spectacle. This is one of the best looking animated films I have watched so far.The sound is another highlight. The score is well-written, the French voice acting was great, and the sound effects were excellent. Overall I would regard the sound as one of the major strengths of this film. The hip hop and reggaeton tracks fit perfectly with the California gangster setting.This homage to GTA San Andreas masterfully mixes European and Japanese influences set in a dystopian Los Angeles. A surprisingly satisfying and fun, if somewhat superficial, action flick which I nevertheless strongly recommend. went missing during development.

I doubt anyone will read this but if you do cool, I hope you like this review. Here\'s my thoughts on the movie.The good, This has some of the best animation I\'ve seen out of the world of anime in recent times. No it\'s...not on par with things like A Silent Voice or other critically acclaimed ""beautiful"" anime but maybe that\'s because this movie isn\'t trying to be anime. It\'s almost hard to think that something like this could be made by an anime studio because it\'s so not anime. Yeah I know Japan wasn\'t the only one who had their hands on this project but maybe that\'s the reason it\'s so good. This is the type of movie you show people who aren\'t into anime. It doesn\'t do the boiler plate same old AnImE that people make jokes of or your parents think of as just cartoons, but instead actually tries to be something different. Character designs are unique and ones you won\'t forget about in the mishmash of ""anime"" characters, the fights feel like they would fit better in a video game and bring this energy that you don\'t normally see in ""anime"" movies, and the soundtrack... omg the soundtrack is probably the standout aspect of this movie. Plenty of times I found myself vibing to the music more then paying attention to the movie. Its mix of techno and latino music mesh so well together that you can\'t help but have fun. A stand out is the Ice Cream truck chase scene. Everything is made to stand out and be different and hits all the marks. This alone makes the experiences great...butAs for the bad, the plot is so scatter shot you\'d think the script got hit with half the bullets that went flying in this movie. Bit off more then they could chew is an understatement for this movie. Starting as a fugitive on the run story we grow into aliens and gang wars and romance and a half baked message about the world. This thing is all over the place and none of it is done well enough to say their was a standout but none are done so badly to say that they were the weak point of the movie. It feels like so much of it was just thrown together to have a plot when you can tell watching the movie that a plot was the last thing on the creators mind. If you go into this expecting to get any sort of fulfillment on anything that then movie offers in its first 10 mins then sorry to say but you\'re wasting your time. It\'s particularity a shame when the characters are so well written. I guess not everything can be perfect but it was a damn shame to an otherwise great movie.In the end Mutafukaz is just a small movie that came and went. It didn\'t make any landmark, groundbreaking, amazing noise in the small amount of time it was in the public consciousness and much like the page on MAL it is forgotten, but now with it being on Netflix I hope people give it a try. It might not be the best thing out there to watch but I don\'t feel like it wasted my time and I was taken on a ride that although the road wasn\'t great or even purposeful at times, left me none the less entertained by what I saw.

The animation is incredible, the universe can seem basic but is sufficiently developed to allow a good understanding, as for the main...characters they are really endearing! The choice of dubbing is very good, I think that Gringe and Orelsan managed to detach themselves from their image of the Breaker Flowers, to correctly embody their respective characters.The film made me want to go read the comics. characters they are really endearing!

It\'s a Japanese adaptation of a French graphic novel with HELLA American influences. This is pretty much a signature of how the definition of ""real anime"" is has been blurred in the recent years.The art and animation delivered this mashup of cultural identities so well that it definitely absorbs the viewer into this dilapidated anime L.A. universe. Background art is crisp and detailed as hell which makes an interesting blend with the abstract, fluidly off-model character animations.The atmosphere of the entire piece...felt solid and unique and was only strengthened by an outstanding soundtrack. The only thing holding the setting back from being what I would\'ve liked is development. The movie does a great job at grounding the setting, but I almost wish I could\'ve seen more of the characters spending time and living in different parts of the city.Characters also suffer from this same shortcoming as we\'re not given enough time to understand all of the characters we follow throughout the movie (this is especially apparent with the main heroine).The story was mostly the main driving point in this movie. The concept and set of events that makes up the story wasn\'t anything that hasn\'t already been told before. However, MFKZ\'s uniqueness comes from the style that it tells the story in. The story does come together nicely towards the end; although, the movie leaves some questions in the air and lacked an amount of tension to deliver on a satisfying climax.The overall theme of the movie was relevant and not too hard to decipher while maintaining a level of subtlety to keep from sounding too heavy-handed. It was also pretty satisfying to recognize the nuances in how the themes developed over the runtime.In conclusion, MFKZ is a pretty good movie that\'s amazing to watch and experience.The main drawback from the movie, however, was that it lacked the sufficient development for the setting and characters.

The only thing holding the setting back from being what I would\'ve liked is development. The movie does a great job at grounding the setting, but I almost wish I could\'ve seen more of the characters spending time and living in different parts of the city.Characters also suffer from this same shortcoming as we\'re not given enough time to understand all of the characters we follow throughout the movie (this is especially apparent with the main heroine).The story was mostly the main driving point in this movie.

The film is constantly flowing and the brief respites feel needed as both I and the main characters are out of breath trying to keep up with all.The stories about two young boys who regard themselves as the dregs of society, they see themselves as the lowest of the low. Even knowing this they try to survive to the best of their ability, but that does not go to plan when they are suddenly targeted by an unknown organisation. What could they possibly want...“we are nobodies”, this is what they tell themselves as they are being chased by this organisation. I won’t say much more than that on the story, it kind of devolves into madness along the way and the chaos just builds up until they can’t really take it anymore. The movie starts out pretty chill for like the first 15 minutes then just goes from 0 to 300 just like that and maintains that momentum for the rest of the movie. There are times of brief respite but it kicks back off almost immediately.The main characters I do like, they are literally two buddies living together and barely surviving. There’s a little banter between them and they have another friend which they both think is the living definition of annoying (looks like Bubsy xD). There’s also this big mafia guy who is a part of the organisation trying to capture/kill them. A girl who one of the main characters likes and a bunch of luchadores. There’s also the gangs, so yeah there is a variety of characters.Animation is superb, it’s done by Studio 4°C and Ankama Animations (a French studio). Studio 4°C is amazing with its detail in the animation they did one of my favourite films Mind Game and that was really good too considering it’s a couple of years old now. Music is fantastic, fits the film to a tee and fits the world and culture the film portrays as well.I really enjoyed this film, my highlights though were the music and animation. The story was good and like I said I really enjoyed it. Also I should mention the version I watched was in French which was interesting, can’t say I watch many films in French so that was different for me, just thought I’d mention that.7/10 “we are nobodies”, this is what they tell themselves as they are being chased by this organisation.

There is a lot going on in the story, but it’s not so much about focusing on that. What really shines are the insanely well-made action scenes, the funny dialogues and characters (I personally...love the Shakespearean gangster), and the amazing atmosphere and visuals.

Nasu: Suitcase no Wataridori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3111/Nasu__Suitcase_no_Wataridori,"[""Most anime, or even media generally that belong to this genre, have this dilemma... what ratio should be allocated to the technicalities, the sport itself, just drama, or even comedy when it desires to go in that direction?While it does have a smattering of comedy, in certain reactions to situations, I think it has more drama than anything. It touches on some heavy topics too, throughout... something which in Andalusia they didn't do, but it is counteracted by some comedy, particularly in the race itself, which is a welcome addition to the minimum requirement for such a genre, something its predecessor suffered from. Both, though,...are under an hour long, and as such there isn't quite much time to get acquainted with the characters and their situations.I did, though, appreciate how they animated not just beautiful views of the cities and green open spaces, but characters' interactions so fluidly that, in some instances, it reminded me of how Ghibli does its art. The 'trembling' due to someone's 'aura' e.g. is similar to how Chihiro reacts at one point in Spirited Away; not saying this has the same calibre of animation, narrative, or variety as in that film, just that some instances are reminiscent, despite being a Madhouse production.I liked, mostly, how the narrative ended up about existentialism in multiple places, as opposed to its predecessor which had much more sport in the ratio, this one added some interesting drama at certain points. Not at all as much as, say, SE Lain had, but if 'shounen' wasn't its genre I'd say it had about the same level of 'culture' and introspection as the Chimera Ant Arc from HxH... if shounen battles were replaced with cycling races, of course... and kept much more realistic.That is, in fact, another factor about both of these... sometimes, perhaps, a bit too realistic, but often that is a positive... with regards to the animation itself, the characters and background landscapes are as realistic as possible, and also feature the appropriate culture in context of the place it's set in... except, in this one mostly, I didn't notice much in terms of Japanese music, since that is where it's set, and still reminded me of Spain, its previous location. It did, though, have shrines and Kannon to reflect the Buddhist aspect... from this angle it reminded me of Inuyasha, particularly as there was also an old man cleaning his shrine (who looked like the bar owner from the previous movie, but it wasn't made clear if he relocated or something).Ultimately, though, despite all these factors, some of which make it a definite improvement over the one in Andalusia, there isn't any single one which 'shines' through... kind of like Kuroko's comedy wasn't as 'powerful' as Slam Dunk's, and the ratio perhaps not as well adjusted... in Nasu: Suitcase No Wataridori I was satisfied with how this ratio was settled on. The first part, especially, resonated quite well... it was, by itself, powerful... but the second part, apart from some comedic bits (which by themselves weren't as 'strong', in my opinion, the drama is also lessened somewhat), wasn't anything extraordinary. Still, an enjoyable 'ride' nonetheless. are under an hour long, and as such there isn't quite much time to get acquainted with the characters and their situations.I did, though, appreciate how they animated not just beautiful views of the cities and green open spaces, but characters' interactions so fluidly that, in some instances, it reminded me of how Ghibli does its art.

As in the first OVA, the animation is very good, better than the original series.  The characters are drawn a little differently (a different animation studio I suppose) but after watching both OVAs I'm getting used to it.There's lots of fanservice which you expect from Negima, and even more than usual because it's an OVA.This is definitely worth watching if you're a Negima fan and will whet your appetite for the whole 2nd season, if you haven't seen it yet.

The story revolves around the trio doing mischief and sometimes being dragged into it. The artstyle of the show is pretty basic with being shounen show that kids watch on a Saturday morning.

It offered a cool setting with interesting themes and characters, but didn’t deliver it in an engaging way. It had at least some things to appreciate like the soundtrack, decent visuals and aforementioned setting, all of which are present here in a similar quality. The setting being the most prominent thing about the first season but needed a lot more focus on fleshing out the world and its inhabitants. It was a good enough foundation to improve from all things considered, which it...now thankfully did, but only to a certain degree.Whereas the first season went all over the place in it’s narrative, here it’s more focused. Giving enough time to expand on the main leads. Mary got her own arc which focuses on her relationship with her long lost brother. Giving her otherwise rather dull character some extra flare. Juzo’s past is also explored more in depth which was one of the more intriguing mysteries of the first season. Even Tetsuro, who I thought was one of the weaker characters, has his own development starting to take root. And is overall not as useless this time around.But while it is an improvement, it’s not with a big enough margin to make up for it’s flaws. Most of which were also present in the previous season. The exposition and dialogue in general felt forced and dumb downed. Likely making anyone watching feel like Einstein’s offspring in the process. It may not be as jarring for some as it was for me. But I feel like with a show that has so much potential for interesting and meaningful dialogue, it’s sad that they didn’t go that extra step.Another issue that has stayed the same is that the characters remain static without experiencing any sort of character growth. They have been more fleshed out, no doubt. However, When their character arcs are finished, they return to their same old self without having changed much from it. They also barely push the story forward themselves. It’s usually the villains or random side characters that forces it to progress. It’s not an ideal approach to make compelling characters and as such they leave a lot to be desired.But while it still contains a lot of the previous seasons' negatives, it improves on its strengths enough so fans of the first season should be satisfied.

I will say that this season focused on aspects of the show that I didn't find as necessarily interesting as season one but it was definitely...far from mediocre.Speaking of Madhouse, I think one of the first things people said about the show is also its biggest weakness, this feels like a Madhouse show from 15 years ago.

Juzo and the rest of the company are back, but the obvious difference is that of more...backstories and high stakes accompany the characters as they go.The one thing that must not be taken away with the 2nd cour is Juzo\'s backstory of him being a Gun Slave Unit, and how he has pursued his fight from being a partner in crime to someone who\'s truly set free from the troubles of having an accompanying partner to make decisions for him. That is some character development to warrant a close watch, and it has been the anchor for the 2nd cour for the most part to define who Juzo is not only as the Gun Slave Unit Device 13, but who he is as a person as the last few remaining GSUs.Once again, Madhouse takes the helm for finishing Part 2, and while the art and animation has been the same for the most part, the one impressive part I can give is the CGI, which has been rendered in Unreal Engine (since the very beginning). While this may not set the animation world on fire, I can appreciate how a different use of proven CGI can work wonders to keep my investment alive and prove that the journey is worth the wait.The one upgrade is in the sound department, and a new pairing for the OST, and I\'d have to say that it\'s a mixed bag. SawanoHiroyuki hits this season\'s top banger OP out of the park collaborating with Man With a Mission (MWAM)\'s lead singer Jean-Ken Johnny on ""Chaos Drifter"", and it\'s a song worth the many repeats of listening.

Part 1\'s ED is much better song-wise IMO, even if the visuals are drab.As a whole, No Guns Life won\'t set the world on heels of suppression of folklore, but it teaches me one thing: Funke Faust!

While this may not set the animation world on fire, I can appreciate how a different use of proven CGI can work wonders to keep my investment alive and prove that the journey is worth the wait.The one upgrade is in the sound department, and a new pairing for the OST, and I\'d have to say that it\'s a mixed bag. SawanoHiroyuki hits this season\'s top banger OP out of the park collaborating with Man With a Mission (MWAM)\'s lead singer Jean-Ken Johnny on ""Chaos Drifter"", and it\'s a song worth the many repeats of listening. As for THIS IS JAPAN\'s ""new world"" ED, while I don\'t like the song that much, I can remember it for one thing: character twerking. Part 1\'s ED is much better song-wise IMO, even if the visuals are drab.As a whole, No Guns Life won\'t set the world on heels of suppression of folklore, but it teaches me one thing: Funke Faust! Pull the trigger that you are meant to use, and use it wisely on someone you trust.', ""No Gun's Life Season 1 was a forgettable romp through what was basically a detective noir story about a man with a revolver for a head and no memory of his past. The season did little to explore anything aside the rift between Extended's and the rest of the world, and introduce characters and concepts that, for the most part, fell flat. What it did excel at was giving us a story similar to stuff like Dick Tracy, where our stoic, straight-faced hero stops the bad guys and saves the day.Season two doesn't tread too far off the beaten path, although it does work...hard to keep from going too deep into shounen territory in order to maintain its own personality. While the action does seem to follow the Law of Escalation (as famously applied in Power Rangers, for all you 90's kids) in terms of how much damage two revolver-headed persons can cause, it does not hesitate to keep to its roots. This is a detective noir, after all, and the author is clearly aware of that fact as each frame is translated to the screen.Juzo's backstory is front and center for much of the season, though other characters are given spots where their own histories are touched upon and provided focus. Where most other series stumble, though, is where NGL finds a good balance. Key points of each characters history are given focus, rather than examining every passing moment of how they got to where they are. Perhaps one of the best moments where this is presented is during Mary's backstory, where we are given brief glimpses into her and her brother's history throughout the episode where it's relevant, and then left to fill in the gaps with what we know.The soundtrack just works. Starting from Sawano Hiroyuki collaborating with Man with a Mission's Jean-Ken Johnny opening, reaching through to This is Japan's New World (both of which are absolute bangers), the soundtrack seems to want to do all the heavy lifting. Thankfully, the characters feel as real as you would expect for people living in a cyberpunk noir, and their relationships feel authentic. The animation is fairly well-done as well, though there are scenes where the use of the Unreal Engine are obvious. Thankfully, it's not so distracting that you'll be pulled out of the more immediate story.If I had to call season two out on one flaw, it would be that it suffers from some pacing whiplash once the final trio of episodes roll around. What should be an emphasis on Juzo rising to his role as the hero and Tetsuro finding his own path can at times feel slow and plodding, while at other times rushing through some scenes and action just to get to the more desirable parts. Also, there is a pervert that is given focus for an entire episode that adds nothing to the larger plot at play, but maybe he'll return..?Either way, I highly recommend No Guns Life. hard to keep from going too deep into shounen territory in order to maintain its own personality.

My biggest problem with the first part was how the director used some inventive ideas in a way that sounded formalistic and mannerist...with no relation to the rest of the artistic unit, however in this continuation he did not bring great news that differentiate both in aspects, but in his approach with some artificialities.There is a search in No Guns Life that always tries to find ways to humanize our relationship with machines in a very personal way. Again, they have feelings, obligations, traumas, fears and also relationships. The protagonist Juuzou goes through a dramatic arc again involving his relationship of being a separate individual or a tool, and the same is done with other Extended ones that appear during the series. The objective is to link both qualities and defects in this relationship, while at the same time, it also dehumanizes that same relationship with other supporting actors in the plot. The funniest thing is how the direction really frames the faces of these machines, which even without any kind of human expression, still manage through simple gestures and sometimes exaggerated (exaggerated in a good sense) to attribute to the viewer a discernment for each of these characters.Through CGI, which is used organically and is somewhat immersive at various times, as if those spaces had a life of their own. The scenarios and the palette of colors darker and more dirty represent very well a harmfulness of the reality of this universe. The anime uses cinematography that literally puts us in the perspective of the characters, it is an inventive form of the director again, but that works better in this continuation. I could even say it was perfect, but the management still has some free technical virtuosity. I see no need for the anime to use lighting filters or a more elegant landscape in some specific moments, since in most of the work it tries to show a more harmful side of this universe, so this spontaneity actually ends up going against unity the rest of the work.The director has what he needs, he managed to improve in all points the way he related to his stylistic elements in this continuation, but it is still not perfect. with no relation to the rest of the artistic unit, however in this continuation he did not bring great news that differentiate both in aspects, but in his approach with some artificialities.There is a search in No Guns Life that always tries to find ways to humanize our relationship with machines in a very personal way.

Assuming you enjoyed the first season at all, you'll find this one an upgrade in every respect. Juzo and co's battle against Berühren and other organisations starts heating up and new characters are thrown into the fray. Story is the same type of atmosphere we saw in season 1, but in my opinion there's more action going for it this time.Quality wise, same as last time. Usual madhouse. Really good CGI when it's needed, cool art, OST and direction. Honestly, there's not much else to add. If you're...watching season 2 of No Guns Life, you must have enjoyed the first part and it's just more of the same here. It's a criminally slept on good watch for anyone who enjoys hardboiled detective series or cyberpunk style worlds. Here's to hoping for another season. No Guns Life II gets 8 hands out of 10 from me. watching season 2 of No Guns Life, you must have enjoyed the first part and it's just more of the same here.

No Guns Life II gets 8 hands out of 10 from me."", ""This second season of No Guns Life follows up the main storyline directly from where it left off at the start of the first season. The plot gets quite thicker, as various layers of development are added to every character, making it easier to relate to them and understand their motivations and personalities better.The sound design and composition was quite good, even better than the previous season even. An absolute banger of an opening, great battle and dramatic tracks, and pretty good ending song as well. The SFX were on point as well.Beautiful art style, just like last season. My only complaint on this front...would be a little too much of cgi in some parts, mainly on the last fight. How come Seven is traditionally animated but Juuzou, whose design is not much more complex than Seven's, is animated completely with CG? It looked janky and broke the suspention of disbelief in that moment. CG animation really isn't one of Madhouse's strong points.Overall, this season holds up quite well, mainly compared to the previous one. Definetely worth a watch if you already got hooked in by the story and characters in the first season.Although I'm rating it a seven, I'd say its a high one, more along the lines of a 7.6 would be a little too much of cgi in some parts, mainly on the last fight.

It was pretty unimpressive. The first series was like a bog-standard ""edgy"" 90s comic. To the point where it could have almost been written and drawn by Rob Liefeld. Except that the artists have a somewhat passable sense of human proportions. This time around, we\'re looking at the sequel from mid 2020. Is it better than the first series? Maybe.Story:We open with an unexpected attack from the terrorist organisation Spitsbergen. Why they named their terrorist group after a scenic area of Norway that means ""Pointed Mountains"" I don\'t know. In any case, they\'re after the...data Juuzou acquired at the end of the last series. And, to get it, they capture Chris & Tetsurou. Things become more complicated when Mary\'s brother surfaces as part of the group.This has a lot of the same issues as the first series. It still makes no sense that Juuzou can\'t pull his own trigger. The writer did know that humans can reach the backs of our necks, right? And I will reiterate that it\'s not an authorisation thing because we have and do see the trigger pulled by teenagers. The series continues to suffer from severe pacing issues with it throwing plot points at you hard and fast. Like they think all of us have uncontrollable ADHD and won\'t be able to sit still while they extrapolate on anything or flesh out their plot points. And I can say, as someone with ADHD, we can actually pay attention to plots and appreciate slow, atmospheric moments.I will give this series credit in one regard over the first, the ending is notably better. This one actually has a major confrontation against a foe who\'s been built up for a while. I also do like some of the flashbacks and the insights they give us on the characters. They also do help flesh out the world a little bit.Characters:The main characters are slightly improved over the clichés of the first series. Juuzou, Mary and Tetsurou all graduate from bland archetypes to bland archetypes with slight variations. We also get to see a small amount of humanity from Pepper and Seven, though the Berühren organisation is still cartoonishly evil. And has a stupid name.Art:The ""extreme"" 90s aesthetic is back for the cyborgs with the bizarre visual characteristics for the human looking characters that just look out of place. The series does still have some smooth animation and decent action sequences though.Sound:The acting is still the strongest element of the series. Numakura Manami, Suwabe Junichi, Yamashita Daiki, Minase Inori and Sanpei Yuuko are all strong actors. The music is still okay, not anything special.Ho-yay:Still none to be found.Areas of Improvement:1. The 90s aesthetic for character designs isn\'t good. They weren\'t good in the 90s and they certainly don\'t hold up thirty years later.2. Your evil corporation needs some redeeming qualities. Yes, it\'s a common cyberpunk trope for there to be a powerful corporation with shady practices and dark designs at the top. But it\'s not common for them to be basically the ruthless terrorist organisation COBRA. With all the subtlety and nuance thereof.3. Take your time. A story works best when it has slow moments to build atmosphere and when the threads that are introduced get developed. This series has a problem with just throwing a shit tonne of sub-plots at you, barely developing any of them and just rushing through developments. It doesn\'t do a good job of building intrigue or investment.Final Thoughts:To its credit, No Guns Life 2 is a slight improvement over the first. There are some major characters who have gone a step above being archetypes and the ending is actually somewhat satisfying. That being said, it still shares a lot of the same problem as your standard Image comic and I don\'t really recommend it. Unless you\'re someone who thinks that the 90s had the best writing and visual aesthetics for comics. My rating is going to be a 5/10. data Juuzou acquired at the end of the last series.

Although it was already some time since I had finished the first season. So, I had to refresh my memory before I started watching this second season. Although, I won't announce any spoilers or anything that has to do with this particular season. But, I will say this, this one highlighted somethings that I was myself, very curious about. This was only the tip of the iceburg, but I loved the action that ensued here, some parts were sad, serious, and comical. But, all...were indeed put well together, so it all makes sense in a way, in others, not so much and a but confusing to say the least, well, at least to me a few parts here and there, about this and that, as I felt minor details of which I found to be important were left out. But, I think that is what makes anime like this, so thrilling to watch, because you don't know what's going to happen, until it happens. I thoroughly enjoyed this season and cannot wait for the next one. were indeed put well together, so it all makes sense in a way, in others, not so much and a but confusing to say the least, well, at least to me a few parts here and there, about this and that, as I felt minor details of which I found to be important were left out.
