Boukyaku Battery (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/56165/Boukyaku_Battery_TV,"['""This will be bad, just like most sports anime that come out every season."" - A self proclaimed sports anime enthusiastI started watching this with zero expectations.I was ready for annoying drama but my expectations were subverted.  Kaname\'s amnesia is more of a plot device to leave him as an amateur baseball player (he hasn\'t forgotten everything, though) and to give him an unhinged personality. He is literally the embodiment of the \'me after the lobotomy\' meme. His annoying jokes are simply a build-up for other characters to roast him. The humor doesn\'t come from him shouting ""nipple hair"" or whining around but from...his interactions with other characters that are forced to deal with him.Might sound boring on paper but a big part plays Miyano Mamoru\'s god-like performance that I would even rate higher than Iketeru Daga\'s wheezing laugh over dick jokes. His way of talking alone makes me laugh like a madman. That is something you have to experience with your own eyes and ears. There is also a childlike innocence to him in his endeavors to try to be good friends with everyone, it\'s heartwarming to watch.Haru is so autistic and him not caring about anyone but Kaname is also fun to watch. This anime also masterfully incorporates memes when you expect it the least, without spoilering any of them. There is a guy whose name is literally written \'toilet\' in Japanese. I also feel like the author made all these ""Let\'s do it together"" and ""I want you to catch my balls"" gay sports anime dialogues fully conciously. Also, I wonder if naming one your characters ""Toudou Aoi"" just like the legendary 530,000 IQ Toudou Aoi was intentional.But Boukyaku Battery is not only about humor. I\'d say a good mix of humor and seriousness is what makes me actually enjoy a story. When it comes to serious scenes, it does a very good job showing the character\'s struggles with trauma and their effort to overcome it with the help of each other. Their traumas are presented in a really relatable way, as if being hit by a baseball in the face yourself. Episode 7 left me as moved as watching an episode of Vinland Saga Season 2.One reason it works so well is the astonishing auditory and visual presentation. Don\'t care about the animation as long the story is good? I don\'t care about that shit. Good animation plays such an important part in conveying feelings. There is a lot of movement, even during scenes when they are not playing baseball. And WHEN they are playing, oh my god. I could cry of joy anytime Haru pitches the ball. The Animation has been consistently good throughout and there are no awkward frames. It\'s not only the fluidity, the movements themselves seem very human. The artstyle is very pleasant and full of detail, and the phenomal lighting does tremendous work for setting the atmosphere of a scene.So, this anime became unexpectedly my instant favorite this season (not that I watch a lot of this season\'s anime...). And I don\'t even care much about sports anime, except for a few chosen ones.  Boukyaku Battery became definitely one of them.(Written after episode 7) his interactions with other characters that are forced to deal with him.Might sound boring on paper but a big part plays Miyano Mamoru\'s god-like performance that I would even rate higher than Iketeru Daga\'s wheezing laugh over dick jokes.

And I don\'t even care much about sports anime, except for a few chosen ones.  Boukyaku Battery became definitely one of them.(Written after episode 7)', ""This season MAPPA is making a baseball anime which is not only good with it's production value and references, but also fun and enjoyable to watch.When we talk about baseball anime, the likes of One Outs, Major and Diamond no Ace are first titles to be mentioned, but the way this anime is going, I believe it's going to make it's place amongst them.Baseball is the main theme of this show, but it's comedy centered as well, the main characters are your typical anime high schoolers with nothing much that stands out in their characterstics, except for Kaname Kei, who has amnesia and...serves as the comic relief character too. serves as the comic relief character too."", 'Boukyaku Battery (or Oblivion Battery) is a great example of the found family trope - less found family and more found team, I guess. Despite the overused amnesia trope, it is utilised in a way where it doesn\'t feel like a nuisance or where it feels forced.The Amnesia:Even if there is a bit of a distastefulness to a character going from serious and stoic to, well, unserious and goofy after amnesia, Boukyaku Battery does an amazing job at it. Kaname\'s amnesia isn\'t used as a way to excuse the things he had done wrong beforehand, but instead he is forced to remember it (or...rather be reminded of it) by facing those he had ""wronged"" in his past. His amnesia also gives him a new perspective to things that his past self would not have considered or picked up on - especially in regard to baseball.The Plot:It\'s a rather basic plot, in my opinion. But just because it\'s a basic plot, doesn\'t mean it lacks potential or the ability to be outstanding. Somehow the simplicity of the plot makes it even more enjoyable. A basic explanation of the plot would be that a group of now high schoolers who once loved baseball but gave up on it due to past failures or other reasons, are realising why they actually loved baseball so much by not only facing their past, but also by competing and working alongside eachother to overcome those fears and failures.The Characters:The characters in this anime are, well, both unique and not unique. We all know at least one or maybe ten stoic characters that barely speak, or a character that tries so hard to be funny it\'s cringey, or a character that\'s struggling to overcome past failures. But despite these character tropes not being unique, I do believe the way they are written and utilised is unique. I love how despite a character being goofy and quirky about their fear of being disliked, there are also more serious moments for said character where you realise ""oh, they\'re not just goofy"". But it also doesn\'t feel like said character\'s goofiness is used to hide something dark or sad, which I often see used. It\'s just that they\'re weird and goofy and it isn\'t used to hide anything. It\'s just something that goes alongside their troubles.Along with the stoic, goofy and overcoming-past-falures characters, we also have our ""normie"" that you\'d expect to have no special talent aside from maybe their personality, as well as the sly character that seems to be good at many things. Regardless of the character tropes being used, I do think this anime does a good job of meshing it all together in a cohesive and not messy way.The Comedy:Though I too find the ""nipple hair"" situation to be incredibly cringey, I don\'t think it\'s used in a way to force comedy or to make viewers laugh. Instead I consider it to be something that shows how lame and maybe even socially unaware certain characters are... as well as how blindly supportive another character is of previously mentioned character. Yes, it is used multiple times, but it doesn\'t necessarily feel repetitive as the responses to this one-liner are different and gives us a look at how different characters react to it and how the person saying it reacts to those reactions. The one-liner itself isn\'t all that comedic or funny, but the reactions sure are. Aside from that one-liner, there are many other comedic moments throughout the episodes that I have seen.The Baseball:Though I knew nothing about baseball before watching Boukyaku Battery and I still don\'t have much interest in baseball as a sport, this anime has me completely hooked regardless. Something that Boukyaku Battery does that I haven\'t seen in some of the other sports animes that I\'ve watched, is showing the scary side of the sport portrayed within the anime. It doesn\'t brush over it in a way where the character just keeps going. Instead it shows what that scary experience can do to the character and how if might affect their performance.I also enjoy how I, as the watcher, get to learn baseball from scratch alongside Kaname who lost his memories. It doesn\'t feel like a sports anime where the rules and such being explained feels forced due to the characters already knowing the rules. Here there\'s a genuine reason for the rules to be explained.Art Style / Animation:The art style was at first not exactly my cup of tea. It\'s not an art style I was expecting from MAPPA or to see at this point in time. But despite that, there is a nostalgic feel to it that is somewhat reminiscint of older anime in regards to how the faces, especially the eyes, are drawn and animated. Despite my first dislike of the style, it somehow grew on me. Some features seem quite repetitive, especially the eyes, but despite the similarities, it doesn\'t feel like the characters suffer from same-face-syndrome or something of the sort.Aside from the faces, I am once again in awe of MAPPA\'s staff\'s ability to animate. Not only with the fluidity of the characters\' movements throughout a game, but also the cinematic aspects of it. Especially in the first few scenes of the first episode.What I Genuinely Disliked:Despite my liking of Kaname, I do find his goofiness to be somewhat annoying at times. Though I have grown to like the art style, I still sometimes feel like the way the eyes are drawn feels a bit out of place for a sports anime. Another thing I wasn\'t a huge fan of was the way a grown adult character (no specifics given to avoid spoilers) was acting. Sometimes an old man throwing a tantrum like a child can be funny - and it was a bit - but it became annoying quite fast.Final Opinion:I genuinely believe that Boukyaku Battery has the potential to be one of the next big sports animes. I just hope others will realise this potential as well so that I won\'t have to wait half a decade for another season. rather be reminded of it) by facing those he had ""wronged"" in his past.

While ""Re-main"" created its own storyline, ""Boukyaku Battery"" is derived from manga, indicating MAPPA\'s preference for this subgenre.Diverging from the serious tone of ""Re-main,"" ""Boukyaku Battery"" incorporates comic aspects, providing a lighter take on team sports. Like its nekketsu competitors However, the plethora of puns, such as Kei\'s ""Nipple hair"" jokes, can be overwhelming at times and may turn off a lot of folks. However, behind these moments is the possibility for an engaging sports anime experience.Despite initial doubts, ""Boukyaku...Battery"" has potential for expansion and improvement over time. With proper care and development over multiple seasons, it has the potential to become a great series according to my gut. The key is in MAPPA\'s commitment.

Kaname has been doing nothing but forced and redundant ""comical"" bits that are now becoming so tired and irritating. Kiyomine on the other hand still doesn\'t have any personality other than being obsessed and teasing a BL with Kaname.They did start utilizing the other character, Toudou for the baseball and serious aspects of the show, and would likely focus on him for another episode or two. It\'s working so far, for me at least, as it gave the story a side plot to follow, in the meantime.There is no story stuff from...Chihaya so far, and Yamada the POV character has become less of an irritating embodiment of a narrator and is now just like a ghost that speaks from time to time.Frankly, if this had bad animation, I would\'ve dropped it already. But since it\'s visually pleasing, it\'s not hard to watch even when lacking in substance. With that being said, I do see a bit of possibility that this could turn into an interesting Baseball-themed Anime when the MCs finally get into some competition/tournament arcs. With how much they are focusing on Toudou\'s character-building, I could imagine Chihaya possibly getting the same treatment and benefitting from it, which could possibly ignite a redemption-driven competitiveness from those 2 characters. The only problem would be if the 2 MCs, Kaname and Kiyomine, remain stuck with a romantic angle even during serious arcs.TL;DR: Don\'t expect straight-up Baseball-heavy content from this, at least not yet. If you don\'t mind going through some character-building that would PROBABLY lead somewhere then it might be worth checking out. Otherwise, just watch (re)watch the Major series.By the way..... Toudou\'s older sister is flaming hot! (The World needs to know.)

Boukyaku Battery is probably more similar to Gintama rather than to other baseball animes (for now). It's goofy, boisterous, and often comes with not-so-decent jokes and dumb references, but it's one of the very few recent anime that made me burst out laughing (multiple times).Despite all the silliness, the anime had surprising expressiveness in baseball related scenes. From the formidable first scene in ep.1, to the first-person view from the ball being hit in ep.2, there were multiple impressive and impactful scenes with...unique camera angles. The interleaving of such scenes created a nice balance for the anime.While told in a carefree way, the story itself sounds like a heavy one - making me curious about how it's going to unfold.

It is silly goofy and funny.. much like watching a j-ent stand up comedy than watching a sports anime 🤣 which i think is the charm of the show.. tbh i got quite tired of serious sports anime like Blue Lock, got too competitive for me.. don’t get me wrong i enjoy those type of shows too but this is a welcomed change.my taste is really slice of life/comedy so anything with a touch...of Slice of life hits my kokoro and vibeThe other review saying this is like watching Gintama, that’s very true, and i love this show for it. Plus the OSTs are also lovely. 😊 of Slice of life hits my kokoro and vibeThe other review saying this is like watching Gintama, that’s very true, and i love this show for it.

Solid sports series, 7/10.Story (5/10): Oblivion battery follows the classic sports series formula of a group of eclectic high schoolers coming together to form an underdog team--but with a twist. The prodigy catcher has lost his memory and turned into an amateur. Occasionally, the series can be a bit juvenile and unrealistic (a public school with no prior baseball team aiming to reach Koshien in West Tokyo is definitely a hard goal to accept if you know the realities of Japanese high school baseball), but if you can suspend...your disbelief enough to ignore some of the more ""anime"" trope-y moments, the pacing and emotional beats still land solidly. The baseball aspects are also well written, going into just enough detail with each position over time to keep a more knowledgable viewer interested without losing newcomers.The major aspect that will likely turn most people away is the comedy. The main catcher\'s catchphrase is definitely divisive, and the running gag about trading porn is also pretty crude. However, I personally felt my annoyance towards it wear off after the story went more emotional/serious. Time will tell whether or not the comedy will remain a detriment.Characters (6.5/10): Really hard to rate characters with only 8 episodes out, but overall they have potential. The main catcher can be extremely annoying in the initial ~3 episodes but mellows out quickly. The main pitcher has almost no character right now, and is mostly a comedic figure, though I expect that to change based on what the series has shown so far. The character with the most development is the blond shortstop, whose 2 episode arc was pulled off with care and perfect pacing, being just long enough to be engaging and convincing. Based on that, it can be expected that similar care will be put into the rest of the cast. Currently, though, all the characters are at least tolerable, if not pretty endearing.Art (9/10): It\'s Mappa. The animation is gorgeous and the direction is great as well. Occasionally there are frames where the proportions of the characters look a little weird, but that\'s more due to the style than an animation error. Nothing much to say here.Enjoyment (7/10): Pretty by the books sports show, but pulls it off well enough. Definitely potential here for a comforting, easy watch with solid characters. If you like sports shows and baseball, give this one a try. Not for everyone though--if you don\'t already like the sports series formula, this one won\'t change your mind, and the comedy can understandably be a deal breaker for some. your disbelief enough to ignore some of the more ""anime"" trope-y moments, the pacing and emotional beats still land solidly.

It\'s frankly not funny at all, it\'s cringe at best and sheer disturbing at worst. The focus on that and literal public \'porno\' trading scenarios are just... I came here to watch Baseball, not whatever this is? (Also, the fact these grown-ass teenagers are calling each other \'doo-doo heads\' like what?)Going back to...said Amnesia trope, it\'s almost as bad as Re-Main; where surprise surprise, the once serious athlete gets amnesia and turns into a complete goof... This anime does that, but somehow EVEN worse. Episode after episode we have to endure the main character whine and complain how he doesn\'t want to play baseball and then plays baseball, while STILL whining... Frankly he needs a couple more baseballs to the head and get his memory back before I lose my own braincells.Moving along, the animation style is frankly so far down the drain from what I\'m used to from Mappa that it might as well be underground. Half the scenes look like I drew them (and I can\'t draw anything but stick figures.) There\'s one scene where one of the characters runs off into the distance and he\'s literally not moving, his size isn\'t changing and the image of him is just being moved further up the page. It\'s lazy and low effort... Other scenes just frankly disfigure the characters so much in attempts of humour, elongated faces with no mouths and all that jazz that just make me wonder what exactly they\'re spending their budget on (and why we could have had Ice Adolescence instead of this garbage.)Honestly, the entire anime is a mess, the characterization is all over, the plot seems barely present at best (shoved aside for immature attempts at humour) and the best thing about it every week is when the credits start rolling. said Amnesia trope, it\'s almost as bad as Re-Main; where surprise surprise, the once serious athlete gets amnesia and turns into a complete goof...

Buddy Complex,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21437/Buddy_Complex,"[""Story:Buddy Complex is a new mecha anime from Sunrise that does not push any boundaries, unlike Valvrave. However, the execution is very well done and keeps me entertained every week. The battles display differing tactics after failed attempts rather than having the same few machines doing the same few moves against each other, which happens in quite a few of Sunrise's previous mecha series. It is a delight to see how our main characters get out of the various difficult situations they are forced into.Art/Sound:Coming from Sunrise, it is not much of a surprise that the art and sound are well done. The background music...during the battles and while they are on standby fit in very well, and the OP and ED are catchy. The battles scenes are amazing and do not have a noticeable amount of re-used scenes. It is a joy to watch for the art and sound alone.Characters:All of the characters seem ordinary. However, they are easily likable and feel human enough not to feel two-dimensional. Also, when they get emotional, there are clear reasons behind them (i.e. their emotional spurts do not seem to be pulled out of nowhere). There are also no noticeable plot holes that I have noticed while casually watching the show.Enjoyment:This is where the series shines for me. The anime does not become too ridiculous or too boring, and nothing about it bugs me.Overall, this anime does not try to be anything out of the ordinary, but its excellent execution and animation keeps me coming back for more every week. during the battles and while they are on standby fit in very well, and the OP and ED are catchy.

We get a normal high school student named Aoba Watase with friends, a smile on his face, and like most kids, likes to play sports when they’re bored. Then, it quickly shifts to a mysterious girl coming from the future to apparently save Aoba, giant mecha dropping from the sky to terminate him, and a time travel phenomenon that changes his life forever. Sounds complex right? That’s just the tip of the iceberg as the show doesn’t reveal much in the beginning. Everything comes out as cryptic and plays you around like a jigsaw puzzle....The only clues from the beginning are from the mysterious girl named Hina. Let the complexity ensure.As a show produced by Sunrise, the classic genre of mecha comes to mind. It doesn’t waste any time in the beginning as we witness several of those causing chaos and havoc at Aoba’s school. The confusing part is not only the HOW but also the WHY. It’s no surprise that the audience will have many questions. But for what’s worth, we do know that Aoba Watase is a loyal friend. Despite having no military experience in the beginning, he listens to every word that Hina has to say and even attempts to save her like the way she is trying to save him. But this initial setup also identifies itself as cliché in the beginning with its gimmicky characters. Taking a look on the surface, the story itself adapts a supernatural device (time travel) and forwards 74 years into the future. But the more complex part is what goes on in that future. For instance, there’s two sides that are seemingly begrudged in a war – the Free Pact Alliance and Zogilia Republic; two sides existing opposite of each other sharing the common goal to win through absolute victory.Events that does come together may sound typical but what happens in the future really ticks one’s mind when characters forwarded in time are seemingly different. For instance, Hina is almost nothing like the high school girl she debuted as. Instead, we are introduced to a Hina fighting for the Zogilia Republic as a loyal soldier. There’s little explanation in the beginning as to why her character went so much change and how she is there in the first place. But nonetheless, we also find out a character (Dio) that was mentioned by Hina as someone significant and possible benefactor to this futuristic world. Of course, Aoba remains clueless about everything goes on, probably in the same state as the viewers. Luckily, Aoba doesn’t change much and still maintains his characteristics as a loyal friend. Taking on the promise to find Dio, we quickly discover that Aoba has a special ability, the skill to perform the ‘coupling’. Again, this comes as a mystery because we know little about Aoba’s background besides his time at high school. What we still hope for are answers to these questions. The show itself explains in packages, little at a time. It does this first with the mechanics involving what ‘coupling’ is and how it’s performed. Then, it goes on explaining the two nations and its backgrounds in diligent yet unnerving ways. While all this makes sense, there’s a lack of interest because the big mystery still remains to why Aoba is involved with all of this. But do take time to familiarize with this show’s concepts as it does take patience to get through. After all, these concepts are complex by origins and even with cliches formulates a story for thought.Tossing theories aside, there’s something innovative about Buddy Complex with its character dynamics. Initially, the three main characters (Aoba, Dio, and Hina) have little to nothing in common with each other. Yet, they all somehow get connected in the story not through a coincidental match up but rather through fate. It brings back the time travel trope with the story as the show likes to pander around with secrets and revelations. At the apex of the story, we also find the mysterious pilot that came from the future to kill Aoba. Of course, Hina is there again but this time is seemingly confused by her own identity. And seemingly enough, identity is another issue as Hina doesn’t seems to know exactly who she is beyond her outer persona. As mystery would have taken hold at the core, Buddy Complex slowly yet vividly reveals little by little of its purpose. Whether it’s done through conversations, flashbacks, or just what’s there, the show does actually attempt to pull this out concisely. It also allows viewers to formulate their own theories and see if their predictions are valid in this typhoon of complexity.Despite the serious nature and warfare dedication of the series, there are moments for lighthearted scenarios. Although it sheds away some of the more tragic moments and brings out a different side, it follows a standard direction of witless context. For instance, the romance subplot between Aoba and Mayuka, another member of the alliance, often comes out as cheesy. It’s not just the dialogues but execution with the usual blushes, misunderstandings, and tawdry interactions. Then, there’s Aoba himself who stands out as nothing really appealing besides his dedication to his friends. Furthermore, we also have Fromm, another supporting character that exploit the princely figure that people seems to idolize. And although Fromm proves himself to be quite a capable player in the war, there’s little characterization besides his initial skill. The series also lacks a bit originality with the classic deserted island encounter, Zogilia’s conception relating to bigotry, and even Gundam Seed-esque installations. What we also do have is clash of ideologies and what the two sides are fighting for – Zogilia’s ambition to conquer the world and Free Pact Alliance fighting for freedom. It’s essentially a duel of wits to bring about a legend to be foretold; a crass legend but nonetheless.The action battles, in general, are outstanding with the rapid pace and intensity. One of the most mysterious device is the ‘coupling’ system, a weapon that can essentially turn the tides of the war. And while some of the battles lacks integrity, the show has strategy from both sides that demand teamwork, innovative maneuvers, and technological demonstration. Each mecha has its own specifications and designs with key elements. The results often serves as evidence to its performance. Whether successful or failure, it creates a sense of credibility with how technology has involved in the future. Even when not in a mecha suit, the characters also show various degree of military experience such as usage of firearms, explosives, and art of deception. On the other hand, the environment as well as the battlefield of the series can feel to be quite stale and generic. It negates a sense of embellishment for what the war has already created.Visual quality is courtesy of Sunrise, a studio no stranger with mecha themed shows. Therefore, expect similarity with some of its previous works in terms of mecha designs. Although most of them seems standard, more prominent mecha such as Aoba’s Luxon and Dio’s Braydon are featured with showcase moments. Character designs are also typical with Hina being the most mysterious with her beauty and secretive backgrounds. On the other hand, Aoba stands out as dull with nothing distinguishing to write home about. Fan service is minimal although poorly coordinated when the time calls for it. Nonetheless, it is consistent by Sunrise standards with its portrayal. Nothing earth shattering but acceptable.Soundtrack plays various roles throughout the series. While some of the OST undermines the serious nature of the atmosphere, there are also moments when it creates variety. In other words, it can shift quickly and simply depending on its scenario. For what’s worth, the OST makes sense whether it’s for emotional scenes, aerial warfare, or climatic moments. The OP song also plays on a decorative way of presenting nearly all the main and supporting characters with decent coordination. And technical wise, most of the characters’ voice mannerisms works well. I do criticize a bit for Aoba’s voice tone as he sounds dull and sometimes forced. The only moments his voice seems to come to life is during arguments he has with Dio and concern for Hina. It’ll take time for the ears to get used to so patience will be key here.Buddy Complex isn’t a mecha series that will influence future generations of mecha on what’s to come. After all, the term ‘mecha’ has a long history with the anime fandom. Sunrise built its studio on this foundation and presents Buddy Complex with a mixture of its ideas. Yet, to dismiss it entirely as cliche should be an overstatement. The show does offer a hook, to draw viewers into its story especially with so many questions. Whether this is an appeal to you or not will differ but simply put, the show isn’t just about robots fighting mindlessly. Just do be aware of its repetitive gags and some episodes that seemingly serves little development or characterization. It isn’t rocket science to understand Buddy Complex but neither is it that simple. Hopefully the second season will answer questions of complexity in the eye of the hurricane. The only clues from the beginning are from the mysterious girl named Hina. Let the complexity ensure.As a show produced by Sunrise, the classic genre of mecha comes to mind. It doesn’t waste any time in the beginning as we witness several of those causing chaos and havoc at Aoba’s school. The confusing part is not only the HOW but also the WHY. It’s no surprise that the audience will have many questions. But for what’s worth, we do know that Aoba Watase is a loyal friend. Despite having no military experience in the beginning, he listens to every word that Hina has to say and even attempts to save her like the way she is trying to save him.

It\'s a new kind of mecha where they bring in time travel and buddy thing as how the title is.Story: 9/10Its simple, the guy in the past go to future then become some cool character then the story slowly unfold how it ended up in 1st episode. War between two nations/country... robot mecha fight around, yea. I like mecha.Art: 8/10The character are normal, but the art of Luxon and Bradyon is nice, and when both of them in coupling mode is so damn cool, like how the wings glow...and all the cg effects stuff. But the 2 mecha still look like some No-grade Gundam. If Buddy Complex have more budget, the mecha will definitely look nicer with a bit of more detail.Sound: 9/10I like both the opening and ending, not bad except the ending give me the feel of watching gundam seed ending. Nevertheless, everything sounds right in this anime.Character: 10/10I gonna admit, I like Hina a lot in this anime, just because of her long black hair and purple eyes and definitely how pretty she is. HINA HINA HINA!!!! And seeing how Aoba and Dio slowly become good buddy is really fun, like how they always quarrel with each other but still care about one another. Other character in the anime are also well developed.Enjoyment: 10/10All the coupling scene is damn nice! Like how fast Luxon and Bradyon move after they coupled. The fight scene and laser everywhere!!!! I also enjoy how Aoba always talking about Hina as though Hina is his only one. But it\'s really enjoyable to see fast action mecha fight that is not one sided, even when it is, it will and must be overwhelming!Overall: 9/10SEASON 2!!!!!! So yea, they execute the ending for season 1 nicely, I thought it would be some Mahou Sensou\'s ending. The anime is enjoyable and no need to think so much when watching, because everything will be known episode after episode. And it\'s very straightforward anime.So if you are interested in Mecha genre anime, it\'s not a bad idea to catch this one because you won\'t have much disappointment in it. Not the best mecha but one of the few good one! :) and all the cg effects stuff. But the 2 mecha still look like some No-grade Gundam.

You may think this is some weird, nerdy mecha anime with painstakingly slow plot progress your too lazy to watch, but Sunrise Studios has done it again. I really liked the funny interactions with each character in each episode, along with the love triangles and the ""world war"" vibes. The main character, Watase Aoba may look like those generic male characters and kinda is, but there is depth in many of the characters.I can\'t also wait for the second season, cause this time they\'ll be romance, trust me, you won\'t regret watching this anime....The only mecha show I ever watched is Code-geass, and this show is just a mix of shonen and shoujo. The only mecha show I ever watched is Code-geass, and this show is just a mix of shonen and shoujo.', ""This is my first Review of an anime since signing up with this site. I have used it for a long time, but never actually used it to keep track of what I had watched until recently.Buddy Complex turned out to be a fantastically enjoyable experience for me. It actually surprised me at how much i ended up enjoying it.Story - 8I found the story to be rather interesting. Sure, the premise has been done before, but buddy Complex handled it well. I never felt like i was being forced to accept the storytellers point of view at any time. It was written in...a way that let me accept things right along with the protagonist. This is something that I feel is important when trying to tell a story, that I should never have to just accept that this or that happened for no obvious reason. There is no real complications to the story, so if you are looking for something to engage your mind, this won't be doing that. But it will entertain you like a good story should It lets you sit back and enjoy it without having to try an wrack your brain trying to figure out what is going on.Art - 10I really enjoyed the ship and mecha designs, and the characters were all done very well. Smooth animation, up to today's standards. Effects and action scenes were all done very well, and if you see a re-used scene then you would have had to be looking for it specifically. I didn't notice one while watching. Not much more to say here, top notch art for this one.Sound - 9OT and ET were good, the battle scenes music was great and fit very well. Sounds fit, characters voices were all done very well, there was depth to battle sounds that needed it, and I enjoyed the music. Not too varied, i will admit, but they used what they had well.Character - 9Not sure if people would disagree with me or not, but I really enjoyed the characters in Buddy Complex. They all felt so real. Relationships within the anime between characters felt like they were moving forward at a true pace, not forced or fake. Characters reactions happened realistically and you could understand each persons decisions when they got mad, or depressed. The main two characters Aoba and Dio really stood out for me. Aoba was not too over the top, considering his situation, and his personality was not unfirm. He made his decisions based on who he was, and what he knew. He was a strong, caring person who was stuck in an abnormal situation. His and Dio's relationship really mattered as things moved forward, and each step that it took the viewer could understand exactly how and why it did so.Perhaps no groundbreaking character personalities here, but you could tell the writers cared about why things happened in the anime, and not just what needed to happen.Enjoyment - 10So much enjoyment for me in this. I really wasn't expecting to enjoy it this much when i started it. But each episode i watched i just liked it more and more. The fight scenes, the characters the story, it all wrapped up an engaging little package that made me feel happy to have opened it. a way that let me accept things right along with the protagonist.

I will probably watch it because it’s gonna be hard to make it more boring than first one, so maybe I won’t be so disappointed next time, but why just 4?Story: 2/10What story? Only the first and the last episode were really worth watching - even though the whole “time travelling” thing doesn’t make any sense… Hey, I’m really curious how Aoba got into the future first time? Cause there must have been reason for Bizon to find him in the past, right? But I expected too much – the whole plot aimed to explain how Hina got in Aoba’s...world and that’s all.

It\'s a pretty standard mecha show that on closer inspection has both standout qualities and heavy flaws.Right from the first episode alarms were going off in my head; this was going to be another time loop story. I really didn\'t have faith that the creators could successfully pull one off here, and to put it bluntly: they couldn\'t. It makes absolutely no sense and is barely understandable even once things are explained. The sheer...amount of logical leaps and assumptions that have to be made when it comes to this time travel plot are astounding. It\'s like they saw Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica and thought they could do the same thing, without actually understanding how those shows work.However, with all of that being said, the time travel story has little to no bearing on the meat of the show, and merely bookends what is otherwise a typical mecha action series with its usual grab bag of tropes. So, for eleven of the show\'s thirteen episodes, you can almost forget about it and all of its stupidity—almost.Our protagonist, Aoba, finds himself sent seventy-or-so years into the future by his mysterious classmate, Hina, where he\'s flung right into a war between two opposing factions. As expected, he ends up piloting a giant mecha to fight for one of them. The series\' main gimmick, and explanation for the title, is actually something called the ""Coupling System,"" which involves two pilots connecting—not combining, but rather syncing up—mid-battle to increase their fighting abilities. A surprising amount of detail is given about how this system works and what effects it has on the pilots, although it can get a little jargon-heavy. At the end of the day, it\'s clearly a plot device to get the series\' main protagonists, Aoba and Dio, to develop as characters together. And, for what it\'s worth, that aspect of the show works pretty well.Aoba\'s disoriented outlook on the world and selfish desire to meet with Hina again naturally conflict with Dio\'s cold front and strict adherence to the military\'s rules, causing them to frequently butt heads. At first, Dio only values Aoba as a necessary component to the ""Coupling System,"" but does learn to respect and care about him as a person. Their interactions and chemistry become some of the series\' strong points, for sure.However, the same can\'t be said for the mechas themselves. Honestly, the mecha designs just don\'t appeal to me at all in this series. They\'re very much like those of Code Geass: sleek, vibrant, neon-colored, and complete with all sorts of jagged edges and pointy bits. Except, unlike with Code Geass, none of them have particularly interesting designs, and trying to tell the difference between each of them becomes a challenge in its own right amidst the fast-paced cuts of the action scenes. The action scenes as a whole fail to be too exciting, being that they almost always take place in the sky above never-ending oceans. Fight choreography is almost nonexistent, with most battles consisting of mechas firing lazers in ambiguous directions at ambiguous targets. Then, once the protagonists\' ""Coupling System"" activates, the battles further devolve into incomprehensible lazer light shows of flashy orbs that zip around the screen causing explosions in their wake. There\'s no real tension as you\'re unable to follow the flow of the action. The only response it might elicit from the viewer is the thought: ""Well, I guess they\'ve got it under control."" From that point on, it\'s probably okay to space out.Though, I will give a shout out to the main theme that pops up near the end of most of these action scenes. It\'s one that\'s sure to catch your attention and maybe even have you believe that the fight you\'ve just slept through was actually grandiose and satisfying; hey, it worked for me at least. Unfortunately, while I have to give props to Sunrise for still bothering to traditionally animate their mechas, they\'re also guilty of resorting to CGI occasionally, and in this show that ratio is somewhere around 50/50. Some great animation could have really made up for the uninspired mecha designs, but more often than not it feels like you\'re just watching some toys floating around on screen.This show is by no means always ugly to look at, though. Strangely, this show has simultaneously generic and appealing character designs. I\'d be lying if I didn\'t say that the girls were super attractive, and if I swung a certain way, that the boys were as well. However, on their own they probably wouldn\'t stand out too much in the larger sea of anime designs. That\'s why it\'s definitely to the animators\' credit that the characters are consistently well-drawn and look great regardless. Particularly, their eyes are given lots of detail, and close-up shots are gorgeous. The character animation is also consistently fluid enough and comfortably above average.Given my contempt for this show\'s mecha fights, it\'s no surprise that I find its slower-paced episodes to be the strongest. Aoba\'s reflective trip to his dilapidated hometown was nice, as he reminisced about his school and his family. It was cool to see and put things into perspective. There\'s also a nice amount of comedy and lightheartedness among the different characters and crew of the Cygnus. Most of them are likeable enough, but just don\'t receive enough screen time. The same is true for the opposing faction, whose similarly large cast of characters just don\'t get the development that they need. Because of this, there are certain scenes that attempt to solicit more emotions from the audience than are probably deserved.Later in the show, we learn that Dio has certain family issues, concerning both his father and his sister. Aoba tries to act as a sort of mediator between them, initially much to Dio\'s chagrin. It\'s interesting to see Aoba\'s perspective on Dio\'s shaky relationship with his father as someone who no longer has the ability to talk with his own, and the drama that comes from this is not bad, although it does feel like more could have been done with it by the end of the series. Nevertheless, it serves as a nice counterpart of Dio\'s to Aoba\'s ongoing obsession with finding Hina.Hina herself is a double-edged sword of a character. Her character arc is fairly interesting, but it ultimately stems from the terrible time loop plot that sets the story in motion in the first place. However, if you can ignore that—and ignoring it isn\'t too difficult considering the worst of it only comes at the end when you learn what was supposed to have been happening—she\'s a worthwhile character with compelling hardships, who\'s forced to make decisions with real consequences. It helps that her design is especially great to look at, too.Now, allow me to go on a bit of a tangent:This show features a textbook example of what I like to call the ""Hopeless Third Wheel"" character. It\'s not that I necessarily hate these characters—they can be cute and have their own fun quirks—but rather, I hate the inevitable purposelessness that they\'re doomed to. These characters are always immediately identifiable: They\'re air-headed, soft-spoken, super nice towards the main character, and for whatever reason, they usually have short hair; tsundere varieties exist as well, and sometimes they\'re a childhood friend. You know they aren\'t going to matter to the main story, and they won\'t ever reach their one goal in life. What is that goal? To fuck the protagonist, of course; it\'s their main defining trait. Problem is, in the shows they usually inhabit, it\'s incredibly obvious who the main character\'s true love interest is, and therefore any progression with this ""Hopeless Third Wheel"" feels like a waste of time for her and for the viewer.Mayuka, here, fits this role to a T. That\'s a shame since she looks quite good and her personality is one of the less grating of this archetype. To be fair, she does get one nice episode where she accompanies Aoba on his aforementioned trip to his hometown, where she gives him support and helps him figure out what he needs to be doing. But, at best, that\'s all the ""Hopeless Third Wheel"" can ever accomplish: locking herself in the ground to provide support for the male lead and subsequently staying there, never moving for her own sake, and never having the resolve to actually get with him as an equal. That\'s why they lose, and that\'s why they\'re frustrating to watch.Anyway... It\'s important to note that this show ends on an extremely rushed final episode that even leaves off on a cliffhanger. But, everything is okay, for a short two episode finale was made to finish it all off. Well, it would\'ve been okay if the sequel wasn\'t actually even stupider than the series was at its dumbest. If you thought the time shenanigans weren\'t too bad here, just wait until you watch that.It\'s hard to say if Buddy Complex was too ambitious or just incompetent. Because it\'s a solid show when it\'s doing things right; certain characters are well-developed and the production values can be great. However, when it comes to mecha action and time travel scenarios, this show falls flat on its face. amount of logical leaps and assumptions that have to be made when it comes to this time travel plot are astounding. It\'s like they saw Steins;Gate and Madoka Magica and thought they could do the same thing, without actually understanding how those shows work.However, with all of that being said, the time travel story has little to no bearing on the meat of the show, and merely bookends what is otherwise a typical mecha action series with its usual grab bag of tropes. So, for eleven of the show\'s thirteen episodes, you can almost forget about it and all of its stupidity—almost.Our protagonist, Aoba, finds himself sent seventy-or-so years into the future by his mysterious classmate, Hina, where he\'s flung right into a war between two opposing factions. As expected, he ends up piloting a giant mecha to fight for one of them. The series\' main gimmick, and explanation for the title, is actually something called the ""Coupling System,"" which involves two pilots connecting—not combining, but rather syncing up—mid-battle to increase their fighting abilities. A surprising amount of detail is given about how this system works and what effects it has on the pilots, although it can get a little jargon-heavy. At the end of the day, it\'s clearly a plot device to get the series\' main protagonists, Aoba and Dio, to develop as characters together. And, for what it\'s worth, that aspect of the show works pretty well.Aoba\'s disoriented outlook on the world and selfish desire to meet with Hina again naturally conflict with Dio\'s cold front and strict adherence to the military\'s rules, causing them to frequently butt heads. At first, Dio only values Aoba as a necessary component to the ""Coupling System,"" but does learn to respect and care about him as a person. Their interactions and chemistry become some of the series\' strong points, for sure.However, the same can\'t be said for the mechas themselves. Honestly, the mecha designs just don\'t appeal to me at all in this series. They\'re very much like those of Code Geass: sleek, vibrant, neon-colored, and complete with all sorts of jagged edges and pointy bits. Except, unlike with Code Geass, none of them have particularly interesting designs, and trying to tell the difference between each of them becomes a challenge in its own right amidst the fast-paced cuts of the action scenes. The action scenes as a whole fail to be too exciting, being that they almost always take place in the sky above never-ending oceans. Fight choreography is almost nonexistent, with most battles consisting of mechas firing lazers in ambiguous directions at ambiguous targets. Then, once the protagonists\' ""Coupling System"" activates, the battles further devolve into incomprehensible lazer light shows of flashy orbs that zip around the screen causing explosions in their wake. There\'s no real tension as you\'re unable to follow the flow of the action. The only response it might elicit from the viewer is the thought: ""Well, I guess they\'ve got it under control."" From that point on, it\'s probably okay to space out.Though, I will give a shout out to the main theme that pops up near the end of most of these action scenes. It\'s one that\'s sure to catch your attention and maybe even have you believe that the fight you\'ve just slept through was actually grandiose and satisfying; hey, it worked for me at least. Unfortunately, while I have to give props to Sunrise for still bothering to traditionally animate their mechas, they\'re also guilty of resorting to CGI occasionally, and in this show that ratio is somewhere around 50/50. Some great animation could have really made up for the uninspired mecha designs, but more often than not it feels like you\'re just watching some toys floating around on screen.This show is by no means always ugly to look at, though. Strangely, this show has simultaneously generic and appealing character designs. I\'d be lying if I didn\'t say that the girls were super attractive, and if I swung a certain way, that the boys were as well. However, on their own they probably wouldn\'t stand out too much in the larger sea of anime designs. That\'s why it\'s definitely to the animators\' credit that the characters are consistently well-drawn and look great regardless. Particularly, their eyes are given lots of detail, and close-up shots are gorgeous. The character animation is also consistently fluid enough and comfortably above average.Given my contempt for this show\'s mecha fights, it\'s no surprise that I find its slower-paced episodes to be the strongest. Aoba\'s reflective trip to his dilapidated hometown was nice, as he reminisced about his school and his family. It was cool to see and put things into perspective. There\'s also a nice amount of comedy and lightheartedness among the different characters and crew of the Cygnus. Most of them are likeable enough, but just don\'t receive enough screen time. The same is true for the opposing faction, whose similarly large cast of characters just don\'t get the development that they need. Because of this, there are certain scenes that attempt to solicit more emotions from the audience than are probably deserved.Later in the show, we learn that Dio has certain family issues, concerning both his father and his sister.

So what do I think about this anime compared to the likes of Steins gate and Code Geass? Well this anime is shit. There is absolutely nothing new here and everything is rather mediocre.... BUT I found a great deal of enjoyment watching it. Dio was ok and the main guy, whose name slips my memory, was rather enjoyable to watch as he has a strong personality and doesn't have an affinity for finding himself in awkward boob grabbing situations where he blushes and gets all embarrassed. The main reason to watch this anime...is Yumihara. One of my favorite Character designs and good voice acting.

That being sad it also brings in some new creative ideas that I have yet to see before in a mecha series. I like the anime mostly because of the characters. Where the story lacks the characters pick up pieces. The main character is a different kind of protagonist, hes not your typical I must defeat the enemy to avenge his family type of mecha protagonist. Which is a major plus because that is over played in this genre.The biggest negative is the story, I can't really tell if its going anywhere or if it is if...it will be good or not. But this does not take away from the overall enjoyment I'm having while watching this.If you want some mecha but nothing thats going to have you in tears then this is the anime for you. it will be good or not.

The main premise of this particular outing is that a mysterious girl named Hina takes a high schooler named Aoba to the future, where he becomes a pilot in a war. Basically an isekai-esque concept, except that rather than a fantasy world, the ""other world"" is simply a future version of the Earth.This piqued my interest...in the series, as I\'d been looking for something that had an isekai-ish vibe and a sci-fi twist to it, and this seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I also figured that I might as will binge it before playing Super Robot Wars X, a crossover game that features the show\'s characters, story, mechs, etc.Now my experience with Sunrise\'s mecha releases in the 2010s is pretty limited to just a few Gundam releases, the VOTOMS OVAs, Valvrave, and Cross Ange. The latter two were glorious trainwrecks that managed to be extremely entertaining just because of how over the top and ridiculous they were. Given that example, I was expecting Buddy Complex to be similar, so exaggerated and dumb that I would be laughing the whole time at it\'s unintentional comedy.Unfortunately, Buddy Complex wasn\'t that, rather it\'s just Sunrise Mecha™.What I mean by that, is that this show just feels like Sunrise just tossed as many of their tropes as possible into one show, and rather than using it to lovingly play with their established patterns, they simply played them all straight. I guarantee if you\'ve watched any Sunrise mecha show, you\'ll be familiar with any of the following elements:- An ordinary boy suddenly becomes a pilot and for some reason becomes an ace quickly (bonus points if their Mecha is white).- A wheelchair-bound little sister character- An episode where two characters from opposite factions are stuck on a deserted island together.- A mysterious female character turns the MC\'s life upside down.- A friendship/romance across faction lines.- A blonde character who serves as the MC\'s rival and/or partner.All of these are present in Buddy Complex and play out just about exactly how you\'d expect them to be, or in the worst case, are completely ignored and rendered irrelevant almost immediately after being introduced. I know that a company can\'t be completely original all the time after 40 years of producing works in a genre, but this just feels phoned in for the most part.But that\'s not to say this anime is without it\'s merits. While it may be highly derivative of previous Sunrise works, the basic premise is interesting, albeit VERY underexplored. The soundtrack is solid, and the CGI work is some of the best I\'ve seen in any Mecha anime. The CGI sequences are at times almost indistinguishable from the drawn segments, making the action much more appealing to watch than it\'s contemporaries, such as Aldnoah.Zero, or Sunrise\'s later work, Cross Ange.The solid animation unfortunately does not help in that the designs themselves are rather bland. Our MC Aoba looks like Gundam ZZ\'s Judau if he\'d been redesigned to fit the general art style of early 2010s anime. The other characters all have fairly generic designs that wouldn\'t really stand out much next to other characters from the time. The mechs themselves suffer from being uninteresting, as they attempt to combine the bizarre and intricate designs of the Valvraves and Villkiss, with the sleek elegance  of Gundam Exia, and the medieval knightly motifs found in Code Geass\'s Knightmare Frames. The result are a bunch of machines who\'s names I can barely remember, and that look like they could easily just be generics in a cheap smartphone game.When comes down to it, Buddy Complex committs the worst crime a piece of media can - being totally average and unremarkable. Although ironically, it was so unremarkable that it made me want to go and write this whole review on it, so that\'s an achievement I guess? Whether it was because of my expectations for this to be a glorious trash fire or just the show being generally average, it left me disappointed.

At the first battle scene you will think that is this really not a strange anime?""Connect with Dio""""Acception""What the heck??However, the story development is very well done. The battles display differing tactics after failed attempts rather than having the same few machines doing the same few moves against each other, which happens in quite a few of Sunrise\'s previous mecha series. It is a delight to see how our main characters get out of the various difficult situations they are forced into.Art: 8/10Coming from Sunrise, it...is not much of a surprise that the art and sound are well done. The character are normal, but the art of Luxon and Bradyon is nice, and when both of them in coupling mode is so damn cool, like how the wings glow and all the cg effects stuff. But the 2 mecha still look like some No-grade Gundam. If Buddy Complex have more budget, the mecha will definitely look nicer with a bit of more detail. The battles scenes are amazing and do not have a noticeable amount of re-used scenes. It is a joy to watch for the art and sound alone.Sound: 9/10I like both the opening and ending, except the ending somehow give me the feel of watching Gundam Seed ending(note: ending here isn\'t the final phase). Nevertheless, everything sounds right in this anime. The background music during the battles and while they are on standby fit in very well.Characters: 10/10All of the characters seem ordinary. However, they are easily likable and feel human enough not to feel two-dimensional. Also, when they get emotional, there are clear reasons behind them (i.e. their emotional spurts do not seem to be pulled out of nowhere). There are also no noticeable plot holes that I have noticed while casually watching the show. I like Hina a lot in this anime, her depicted character with her long black hair and purple eyes.Enjoyment: 8/10This is where the series shines for me. The anime does not become too ridiculous or too boring, and nothing about it bugs me. All the coupling scenes is good, I also enjoy how Aoba always talking about Hina as though Hina is his only one. But it\'s really enjoyable to see fast action mecha fight that is not one sided, even when it is, it will and must be overwhelming!Overall: 8.4/10Overall, this anime does not try to be anything out of the ordinary, but its excellent execution and animation bring this anime as one of the few good mecha anime. is not much of a surprise that the art and sound are well done.

I like Hina a lot in this anime, her depicted character with her long black hair and purple eyes.Enjoyment: 8/10This is where the series shines for me. The anime does not become too ridiculous or too boring, and nothing about it bugs me. All the coupling scenes is good, I also enjoy how Aoba always talking about Hina as though Hina is his only one. But it\'s really enjoyable to see fast action mecha fight that is not one sided, even when it is, it will and must be overwhelming!Overall: 8.4/10Overall, this anime does not try to be anything out of the ordinary, but its excellent execution and animation bring this anime as one of the few good mecha anime.', 'A basic mecha anime with an extremely interesting gimmick ruined by a boring setting, generic characters with half-baked relationships and time travel shenanigans.Given that the very cool Coupling system hinges on the main leads\' growing comradeship the anime would\'ve probably benefitted from having more episodes, as the relationship between Aoba and Dio feels severely underdeveloped and I couldn\'t help but roll my eyes at the ""bond"" between Aoba and Hina. I ended up much more invested in Hina\'s friendship with a certain secondary character, who seemed pretty nice and reasonable until the writers decided to make him do a 180 and make him irredeemably evil...and unlikeable in what I assume was an attempt to make us root for Aoba and Hina instead.The voice cast is positively STACKED and Hayamin smashes her role as per usual, so the sheer amount of notable actors might make this worth watching if you\'re a seiyuu enthusiast.The mecha designs are pretty cool if a little on the generic side, but I know how difficult it is to design totally unique-looking robots. The fight scenes are all made in (THANK GOD) 2D animation, which is increasingly rare for the genre these days. The action sequences are pretty neat and when activated the Coupling system adds a nice visual flare to the robots.The character designs themselves aren\'t all that noteworthy other than Hina, who I found really visually appealing. Everyone wears these basic as hell futuristic military uniforms so if you dig that aesthetic you\'re in luck.Overall, I think I went into this show with my expectations too high. While it is a perfectly serviceable mecha anime I saw in it the potential to be something truly special and found myself very disappointed and frustrated when it failed to live up to that potential.Mecha fans will probably get some enjoyment out of this show for the fight scenes alone (though they feel rather short), and there\'s got to be Someone out there who\'ll actually care about the character drama; unfortunately that someone wasn\'t me.Also the opening goes hard as hell. and unlikeable in what I assume was an attempt to make us root for Aoba and Hina instead.The voice cast is positively STACKED and Hayamin smashes her role as per usual, so the sheer amount of notable actors might make this worth watching if you\'re a seiyuu enthusiast.The mecha designs are pretty cool if a little on the generic side, but I know how difficult it is to design totally unique-looking robots.

Besides the fact that it contains the usual mecha characteristics, it had a really intriguing and fairly original story line. Because Hina’s relationship with the main protagonist Aoba was kept from the viewers until the very end, it was necessary to complete the anime (including the 2 episode ONA) in order to have all the questions answered. Not only was the story line enjoyable, the action scenes were executed well. The animation was on point and fun to watch, and the character designs as well as the mech designs were well made. I enjoyed watching...this anime, but I can’t say that it’s one of my favorites. It had elements that I liked very much, but some parts felt rushed. For example, I do wish the relationship between the main characters Aoba and Hina had been developed a little deeper. However, I do recommend watching this anime.

It trims enough fat to only leave the exciting moments and it only has a slow point in retrospect.

After piloting the mech, our hero, Watase Aoba, is conscripted into the war between Zogilia and the Confederation.Despite its brevity, one of the show\'s strengths is its ability to make the most of its runtime.

The action scenes involving the mechs are stellar and never become dull, and the music is a joy to listen to. The Japanese voice acting is top-notch, and it\'s evident that the actors put their A-game into their characters.It\'s regrettable that ""Buddy Complex"" won\'t see more than this or its two-part finale. Apparently, it was prematurely ended due to poor ratings, but I personally believe that banking on a smartphone game, where additional character backstory was also left, instead of model kits, isn\'t the best way to sustain a show.In conclusion, if you\'re seeking a light yet enjoyable mecha show, give this one a watch.

This is what i expect of a fucking history anime from 2018.YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESThis anime is soooooo good. The art style is clean, the mc is a fucking badass, and its historical. Get your ass ready for some fighting scenes from ~1300.Its basically a story about a samurai who got expelled and now has to fight as a slave from another city who bought him.The characters are nice. Not really indept only the mc really has a backstory so dont worry if you forget everyones name COUGHI HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS NOT MORE NEEDED JUST WATCH IT! ', 'Representing a historical fiction of war and cruelty, I decided to watch Angolmois with one goal in mind: to embrace a war story and accept exactly for what this show is. To my pleasant surprise, Angolmois not only succeeded in bringing a war story to life but also reminds me that we need more creative shows like this in our generation.I’m not going to lie, shows with a historical genre tag isn’t really my cup of tea. I’m more used to the traditional live action style of historical storytelling than those made into anime medium. Still, there’s something exceptionally intriguing about this series. Angolmois: Genkou...Kassenki (also known as Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion) sounds about as straightforward as it gets. Taking place during the 13th century, it deals with a war drama as the Mongolian Empire makes their presence in the world. Japan became a target of this almighty empire and thus begins the Mongolian Invasion.Angolmois has confidence to be its own story. It takes a realistic approach at historical fiction with the war themes as the first episode introduces us to a variety of characters, the setting, and the plot. The show reveals a group of exiles on their way to Tsushima Island. We are introduced to Kuchii Jinzaburou, a swordsman and former trainer of the Kamakura Shogunate. As a former prisoner of Hakozaki, he also saves Chou Minpuku, another exile. My impression of just the first 10 minutes of the series made me realize that Jinzaburou is not ordinary man. He’s more of a daredevil hero who isn’t afraid of taking action or holding back. After arriving on the island, the exiles are given the task of defending it from Mongols. Joining them also include a former pirate named Onitakemaru, former noble Shirashi Kazuhisa, among others. Due to such a pilot episode, it felt like Angolmois may be taking the risk of jumping the gun too fast. However, I would also mention that by doing so, it had me intrigued at just how far these characters will be able to carry their roles.At the centerpiece of the cast is Jinzaburou. I already mentioned that he isn’t a traditional protagonist but more of a thriller seeker. He enjoys the sheer thrill of the fight even though he’s not a malevolent person. Thanks to his samurai experience and swordsman skills, he is able to hold his own against powerful foes. What’s important is to realize that Jinzaburou also possesses leadership skills. This is a man that plays with calculated strategies, tricks, and gambling circumstances into his plans. While he’s not a master strategist, I came to realize that the show gave him a balance of brain and brawn. He has a somewhat creative mind and isn’t afraid to express his feelings. Thanks to some help with his allies, he is able to accomplish some near impossible feats including being able to defend against the Mongols. Other characters in the series vary a bit more such as Onitakemaru who acts more as the pure muscle with his large size and strength.  The princess of Sou Clan, Teruhi also shows talent in archery as part of the group. At first glance, I wasn’t too impressed by her character as she played the role of a generic princess. However, my stance changed once I saw her courage. In one particular episode, she takes a bullet for the team and protects someone from an assassination. Not only did this impress me but it also established her as genuine heroine who puts others before herself. Still, the show puts her in an awkward position at times. It became obvious that she has a girly crush on Jinzaburou and the show doesn’t do a clever job at exploring their relationship. Needless to say but I’ll say it anyways, this anime does not work well with relationship building.This is because war is essentially death. It’s simple as that really. People are going to die and there are even foreshadowing of this (for instance, the ED theme song). The anime doesn’t fool around with character deaths either and some are rather violent. This came to me as a positive in the show as it continues to demonstrate the reality of war. Blood is spilled, body parts are scattered, and even heads comes off from necks. If you’re not prepared, then be ready to turn back. I should also mention to not get overly attached to certain characters in the series because not everyone will make it. Or even, there are betrayals in this show. That’s right. The character cast are humans so everyone has their own will to commit sins. On the other hand, I wish the series committed more time to develop the antagonists. There’s much more emphasis on the main characters than the antagonists. While this makes sense, I would’ve appreciated if the anime made me care about the Mongols more than just their reputation. It seems at times, they look like fools who falls under obvious traps. On the other hand, I am satisfied by how this series makes me hate them as the villains. Some of their roles includes abducting families and committing atrocities just to prove their reputation. As such, I often rooted for Jinzaburou and his comrades. There are also some moments in the series where characters go down fighting to the last breath. And that really paints how far characters are motivated to defend their honor.A show like Angolmois really has a distinctive style from its visual and production. The action scenes is bloody with realistic body movements. There’s an abundance of violence that convinced me this as a war story. Speaking of war, the character designs looked cruel but also dynamic. Most of the main cast are dressed like warriors while characters such as Teruhi gave me a strong action heroine impression. The one person that stands out most would still be Jinzaburou. His expressions during fighting is exceptionally real and some of his body features represents his character. (more evident being a visible scar on his face) The setting also gives a vivid look of these old times with the historical buildings and landscapes. Even during some static scenes, it paints the show like a work of art.If you want a show like this to be realistic, you’d need a talented voice cast. Thankfully, characters like Jinzaburou represents a warrior with his masculinity when he speaks. The exiles in the series prove themselves as independent characters striving to be free. Their voice expresses their feelings when fighting and it’s definitely not an understatement. The theme songs in the series are also refreshingly beautiful. I don’t see people talking about it often but “Braver” by Starightener sounds so smoothing to the ears. It’s one of those theme songs that fits perfectly for this historical fiction. Likewise, I’m also more than impressed by the soundtrack being able to keep up with the fighting action at all times.I said it before but I’ll say it again. I decided to watch Angolmois for exactly what it is and thankfully, that’s what I got. It’s a story that meets expectations of being realistic and showing the cruelty of war. Even as predictable as the plot gets at times, I felt that the anime was able to keep me at the edge of my seat. War has consequences and we got Angolmois to prove that.

You have been warned.Based off a popular manga of the same name Angolmois Genkou Kassenki is an action, military and historical anime that gives us the unique opportunity to go back in time and see the events that transpired during the standout moment that serves as the series main premise which was the first Mongol invasion of Japan which took place in the year 1274 and the attempts by...its defenders to hold the line against impossible odds. While military and actioned themed anime are relatively common within the anime industry as shown in brilliant series like the Gate and Valkrie chronicles series that featured a true historical event as its main premise is something of a rarity and indeed this is the first time I seen an anime that made use of this. As a fan of not just the genre’s but also of the samurai as well I was drawn to the anime after reading through the summary of the anime’s plot and was impressed enough to add it to my watch list for this season. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me as it not only introduced the unique characters that would later take center stage in the war but also the unique setting that existed in that time period both of which served to motivate me to watch the series to the very end a move that I felt was now worth it.Taking place on the island of Tsushima in the year 1274 in a land far removed from the bloodshed and fierce battles that had taken place on the mainland. Here rather than match wits against each other and fight against each other on the fields of battle for things like honor, glory and wealth the people of Tsushima island exist in a simple peaceful society one where the people only worry about whether their next harvests and fishing fleets will be able to find enough food to survive another week and one where conflict is tightly controlled by its ruling clan the So clan. However unknown to the general population this peace is about to be shattered for a large threat that’s akin to an invasion from one of the sengoku’s periods greatest warlords was approaching in the form of a vast invasion fleet from the newly awakened Mongol empire that’s determined to make Tsushima the first step in its eventual invasion of Japan.The overall story for the series using this setting as its canvas follows a group of samurai that thanks to the peace that now reigns within Japan was released from their imprisonment and sent to Tsushima island as exiles never to return from there. Among their number was Kuchii Jinzaburo a veteran samurai and a former retainer of the Kamakura shogunate who while accepting his fate still aspires to one day be able to return to his homeland and reunite with his family. But rather than being exiled to a remote location and to live out an existence far from people Kuchii and his fellow exiles soon find themselves placed once more on the frontlines as the Mongols begin their invasion of the island. As the armies of the island’s reigning Sol clan are decimated and as the Mongols advance into the heart of the island Kuchii reawakens within him a sense of determination that he had thought forgotten a determination to not just protect the innocents but also to fight against worthy foes. Taking up the signature samurai armour and katana that symbolises his old role once more Kuchii begins to once more become not just a samurai but a leader as well as he begins to orchestrate the desperate resistance of the island’s inhabitants and protect them from the Mongols by giving them their first taste of something that they have not encountered until now which is defeat.Joining Kuchii in this desperate defence of the island is the island’s sole remaining representative the kind but determined Princess Teruhi that despite being a princess is a capable fighter that’s both brave and cunning and while not close to Kuchii’s fighting abilities more than makes up for it in her ability to inspire loyalty and determination within her people. Together these two along with their allies would fight hard to stop the Mongols and protect the island’s inhabitants and buy time for the mainland to ready their defenses.Kuchii JinzaburoKuchii Jinzaburo voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono of Food Wars and Strike the Blood fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A former retainer of the Kamakura shogunate that was exiled to the island as a result of the advent of peace on the mainland Kuchii from the onset was shown to be someone that was quiet, level-headed and calm and while his manner of speech was rather direct he was someone that was honorable and knew when to rein this nature in. An intelligent and rational person by nature Kuchii was someone that was noted to be quite perceptive able to both sense and see the subtle shifts of people’s behavior quite easily a trait that is no doubt born from his long career as a samurai. However while a quiet person Kuchii was someone that was noted to have a strong sense of duty and responsibility and while initially not interested in helping the Islanders in their defence soon changed as his mind as he began to realize that the Islanders just like the people back in homeland are innocents that were caught in the middle of a war that they didn’t want and as a result decided to do his best to protect them. While somewhat brooding and difficult to approach by many it can be seen that beneath this Kuchii is someone that’s not just kind and caring towards his friends and allies but also understanding, confident and inspirational traits that are bolstered by Kuchii’s natural sense of perception which enables him to easily notice and understand the key reasons that his men are fighting for and inspire them by using these very reasons. Unlike most other samurai who would prefer to take to the field at once and face the enemy on the field with all their might and skill Kuchii was someone that can be seen to something of a rarity in that he prefers to gather info on his enemies first and determine not just their tactics but also their ideology and motivations before making a decision on his actions which shows that while Kuchii was a capable samurai he was also a capable strategist as well that looks at the long view something that will be crucial for a sustained defensive war.As the series goes on and as Kuchii’s personality is gradually expanded upon his personality starts to change as we get to see the effects that the war has on him. After the destruction of much of the Sol clan’s forces in the initial defense command of the defensive war was soon passed to Kuchii a role that while he excelled at was also one that placed a heavy burden on him. While possessing boundless amounts of confidence Kuchii was someone that respected the soldiers that served him a great deal seeing them as brothers in arms and as a result he is someone that will remember the deeds and names of each of them that died under his command and use this as a source of his courage something that I felt really matched the idea of a compassionate samurai that the character of Kuchii was modeled as. Unlike the islanders who have a valid reason to fight as they are fighting to protect their homes and also for justice for loved ones that were killed by the Mongols Kuchii, in the beginning, did not have a valid reason for taking up the katana once more a reason that some of his fellow exiles ridicule him over.Indeed, while Kuchii does not fight for their homes or for justice as neither were things that he had to concern over when fighting in the bloody battles on the mainland he does, however, believe that one must not surrender to their fate and instead if you want to be able to live you must live your life your way and defy fate by standing up and fighting against it. It is this fierce sense of wanting to defy fate that Kuchii fights so hard and why he is able to inspire such loyalty among his fellow defenders something that I felt matched well with his inspirational nature. The character of Kuchii I felt was a character that was both well designed and developed with his evolution from a quiet, blunt and brooding ex-samurai to one that was kind, understanding and inspirational being particularly interesting. The evolution from an exile and a former samurai to becoming both the field commander and the savior of Tsushima island and its people was something that I really liked about the character of Kuchii. I felt that his voice actor Yuuki Ono really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kuchii.TeruhiTeruhi voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of Fuuka and ElDLIVE fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Kuchii’s main allies within the series. A 17-year-old-year-old girl and the only daughter of the ruler of Tsushima island and patriarch of the Sol clan Sukekuni So Teruhi is one of the first people that receive and welcome the exiles and Kuchii to the island. From the onset, it can be seen that Teruhi despite being a princess and the sole daughter of the island’s reigning clan is someone that’s kind, compassionate and dutiful and was seen to have great pride as a member of that clan. Unlike most princesses, Teruhi was shown to be a caring and responsible person that treated all with humility and respect and as a result, had the loyalty and respect from much of the island’s inhabitants. However, while kind and compassionate Teruhi was also someone that was both intelligent, perceptive and cunning and was one of the first to realize that the upcoming Mongol invasion will be something that will be difficult to stop without help which resulted in her enlisting of the help of the exiles despite the risks that can be born from it. At the beginning of the series while shown as intelligent, calm, determined and cunning it can be seen that this is only what she projects on the surface for beneath this it can be seen that Teruhi is someone that’s emotionally fragile and is one that dislikes fighting and killing and as a result of the coming storm worries greatly about her home and her friends. A realization that unfortunately turned out to be true for her.As the series progressed and as the war began to slowly turn against the defenders Teruhi’s personality gradually began to change. At the beginning of the series though very determined to be of use to both her clan and the people of the island Teruhi due to her father’s wishes was prevented from taking to the field. However, after his death and Teruhi succeeding the role as clan leader this barrier was removed and Teruhi began to take to the field and fight on the frontlines in order to protect her people. At the beginning of the series, Teruhi due to her position as a princess was someone that was noted to have a strong sense of pride that also caused her to develop a degree of overconfidence in her traits that often caused Kuchii and the defensive effort more trouble than needed. However, as a result of successive tragedies that created a heavy emotional toll on Teruhi this side of her gradually vanishes as the series went on and is replaced by a sense of not just a determination to learn how to fight effectively but also instilled within her the realization that they cannot fight this threat alone any longer and that maybe its time to ask for help rather than being stubborn about it if she wants to be able to protect the people that she so values. This latter point is seen in the humility that she displays when seeking to ask for the assistance of the Toribarai.At the beginning of the series, Teruhi and Kuchii had a rather tense first meeting due to her intention to make use of the exiles as soldiers in her desire to use them to protect the island from harm. As a result of this relations between the two were rather tense but as the series went on and Teruhi bore witness to not just Kuchii’s skills as a warrior but also his ability to not just inspire others but also come up with creative strategy and tactics that dealt with the Mongols in devastating ways this view gradually changed as Teruhi began to realize that he was exactly the type of person that they needed. Arguably one of the central reasons that caused Teruhi to change her opinion on Kuchii was that unlike what his usual gruff and brooding attitude would have suggested Kuchii was someone that was not just kind but also understanding of the plights of others a type of person that Teruhi had only seen rarely and contributed to her gradual bonding with him. At the same time, he was also one of the first people that defied her orders something that Teruhi paid him back within the series by insisting on joining him in battle and in the process not just keeping an eye on him but also gaining valuable insight into how battles are fought and how effective use of tactics can level the playing field even against overwhelming force skills that proved to be useful as the series progressed.The character of Teruhi I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a prideful but surprisingly fragile princess to one that was not just brave and determined but also more humble being one of the best aspects of her character. Seeing Teruhi not just overcome her initial fear of killing and combat but also be willing to fight on the very frontlines and learn to use the tactics and teachings that she learned from Kuchii to protect those that she cares about was something that I thought was really well done. I thought that her seiyuu Lynn did an excellent job at portraying the character of Teruhi.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main characters were really well done and I felt that the outfits that were worn by the cast matched well with the time period that the series made use of. In particular, I felt that the outfits that were worn by both the nobles and retainers like Teruhi and her servants and the ones worn by the exiles and the peasants did a good job of defining the social class that they belonged too. In terms of combat armour that was worn by Kuchii and his men as well as the soldiers of the Toribarai I really loved the variation of the armor that is shown as these while also showing the different roles that they would play on the field also showed the kind of tactics that both factions use which within the series are polar opposites of each other. The armor that was passed on to Kuchii and one that he subsequently adapted as his main set I felt was both designed and showed well Kuchii’s advancement in role within the series as at that point Kuchii went from being an exile to one of the foremost defenders against the upcoming invasion. Location wise I thought that the island of Tsushima featured quite a variety of terrain that while pretty to look at also served to be effective terrain for the defenders as they continued their resistance against the Mongol armies. Of these locations, I thought that the castle that was used as the Toribarai was probably my favorite one as that castle while large and hard to defend was one that was both impressive visually but also as an effective defense.As an anime focused on action and war it was important that Angolmois managed to get the combat animation right and at the same time make the battles that feature them easy to read and understand. In this, I felt that the series did relatively well. While the combat animations were relatively smooth I felt that the combat scenes were not just bloody but also brutally so and did a great job of showing just how well stepped the samurai actually were when they fought on the battlefield. Whether it was one vs one or one vs many I thought that the combat scenes within the anime were well done and did a great job of showing the desperate fights that the defenders had to fight in in order to protect their loved ones from the invaders which were helped greatly by the unique art style that was used for the series. In terms of enemy design while only seen a handful of times I thought that the designs for the Mongol commanders were interesting ones with the best examples being the Mongol spymaster and the Mongol vice marshal Liu Fuheng.In terms of music, I felt that the series OST did a pretty good job at providing not just an excellent soundtrack to the many scenes within the series but also helped inject some tension into the many battle scenes that are within the series. The series made use of one opening and ending theme respectively which was Braver by Straightener and Upside Down by She’s both of which was strong songs that I felt complemented the series really well. In terms of voice acting, I felt that both Yuuki Ono and Lynn both did an excellent job portraying the characters of Kuchii and Teruhi. In addition, while I didn’t cover them within this review I also thought that Mikako Komatsu, Shun Horie, Natsuko Hara, Rikiya Koyama and Kensho Ono who portrayed the characters of Kano, Amushi, Sana, Onitakemaru and Hangan respectively all did an excellent job at portraying the supporting cast.Overall conclusionIn overall Angolmois was an anime that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its unique premise, interesting story, well designed and developed characters, well designed and developed battles, excellent voice acting and its inclusion of multiple themes that actually work well in the context of a war.The overall premise of Angolmois which was the Mongol invasion of Japan and its invasion of Tsushima island as the first step in their master plan was an unusual one as historical events like this aren’t usually used as the premise for an anime but this is what makes the premise of Angolmois a strong one as the desperate situation that this entailed served as the ideal canvas for inserting the band of former samurai, thieves, pirates, and misfits into as no matter how unique their former lives were their skills are now more sorely needed than ever in perhaps the largest battles that any of them has fought in.The overall story for the series I felt did a great job of taking advantage of this strong premise by not just introducing the island’s foremost clan but also introduce a number of characters that while openly dismissive of the exiles at first gradually grew to respect them as the war between the Islanders and the Mongols rapidly turned against them. As the story progresses and the war between the two factions gradually expands in scale this respect that exists between the Islanders and the exiles while still cold to some extent especially among the more senior retainers and the ones that have an arrogance about them gradually evolves as the exiles most prominently Kuchii begins to not just fight back against the invaders but surprisingly score victory after victory against them. While dealing a major blow to the invader's plans this act also served as an excellent foundation for both the Islanders and the exiles as while both have very different temperaments both factions believe that cooperating with each other would be the best path forward for both of them. Seeing not just Kuchii and the rest of the exiles but also Teruhi and her clanmates gradually learn to respect each other as they fight together was something that I felt was done well and illustrated the fact that even when faced by the cruelty of war the forging of bonds of friendship and comradeship would go a long way in helping them survive and fight another day. This is best shown in the many battles and tactics that were used by Kuchii and his comrades much of which relied upon the trust and respect that the Islanders and the exiles had for each other in order to succeed in them. I felt that the series made great use of a variety of tactics that really served to keep the Mongols guessing on their intentions. These included the use of ambushes, night assaults, explosives, firearms, and psych warfare all of which were devastating to both sides.While the combat and the learning to unite against the common foe is the series main theme I thought that the series also did a great job of allowing us to look at the human side of a person whether that person is a trained soldier, an ex-samurai or simply a islander that while scared wants to be able to protect his friends and family from the invaders by allowing us to see the kind of motivations that they have for taking to the field, what serves as their main source of motivation and what their deepest fear is both on the field and off it. This latter point I felt was interesting as fear just as it can serve to incapacitate you if you let it control you can also be used as a great source of motivation if you are able to convert it into a source of your strength something that Kuchii within the series excelled at.Overall Angolmois was a really enjoyable anime that made great use of its strong historical backdrop to give us an interesting tale of how a former samurai that was exiled to die a lonely death in a long forgotten island alongside his fellow exiles were to instead become one of the islands foremost defenders as they fought alongside their fellow islanders and turn what the Mongols thought to be an easy victory to one that will prove costly to the Mongols in terms of casualties and resources and showing them that when faced with the power of the samurai and determined islanders that are intent on defending their home even the Mongols famed numbers may not guarantee them victory. As a final score I would say that it deserves a final score of 9/10. its defenders to hold the line against impossible odds. While military and actioned themed anime are relatively common within the anime industry as shown in brilliant series like the Gate and Valkrie chronicles series that featured a true historical event as its main premise is something of a rarity and indeed this is the first time I seen an anime that made use of this. As a fan of not just the genre’s but also of the samurai as well I was drawn to the anime after reading through the summary of the anime’s plot and was impressed enough to add it to my watch list for this season. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me as it not only introduced the unique characters that would later take center stage in the war but also the unique setting that existed in that time period both of which served to motivate me to watch the series to the very end a move that I felt was now worth it.Taking place on the island of Tsushima in the year 1274 in a land far removed from the bloodshed and fierce battles that had taken place on the mainland.

These included the use of ambushes, night assaults, explosives, firearms, and psych warfare all of which were devastating to both sides.While the combat and the learning to unite against the common foe is the series main theme I thought that the series also did a great job of allowing us to look at the human side of a person whether that person is a trained soldier, an ex-samurai or simply a islander that while scared wants to be able to protect his friends and family from the invaders by allowing us to see the kind of motivations that they have for taking to the field, what serves as their main source of motivation and what their deepest fear is both on the field and off it. This latter point I felt was interesting as fear just as it can serve to incapacitate you if you let it control you can also be used as a great source of motivation if you are able to convert it into a source of your strength something that Kuchii within the series excelled at.Overall Angolmois was a really enjoyable anime that made great use of its strong historical backdrop to give us an interesting tale of how a former samurai that was exiled to die a lonely death in a long forgotten island alongside his fellow exiles were to instead become one of the islands foremost defenders as they fought alongside their fellow islanders and turn what the Mongols thought to be an easy victory to one that will prove costly to the Mongols in terms of casualties and resources and showing them that when faced with the power of the samurai and determined islanders that are intent on defending their home even the Mongols famed numbers may not guarantee them victory. As a final score I would say that it deserves a final score of 9/10."", 'Angolmois: Genkou Kassenki, or the Record of Mongol Invasion, speaks entirely for itself: The samurai-ish historical action-drama about a ravaging war that broke out with the invasion of the Mongols in its time (when the Mongols were the most powerful army on the planet), or more specifically, the real-time events timeline of 1274 with the very first Battle pf Bun\'ei: The battle for Tsushima Island (Spoiler: Mongol victory).The series starts off unorthodoxly similar-sounding to the events of the Mongolian Invasion with a twist: a group of exiles, banished from the mainland, and are headed the way to Tsushima Island to protect the people there from...the upcoming invasion. Led by the brave Samurai and calm but composed strategist who goes by the name of Kuchii Jinzaburoh, and his band of exile mercenaries with unique characteristics and roles to play with, these exiles were given a death sentence to boot, and it\'s primarily their choice to either help or sabotage the entire operation.Upon reaching Tsushima Island, they are confronted with the upheaval task ahead of giving their resources, be it brain or brawn to help educate the people about the war, equip them with war knowledge to fight back, all at the helm of Princess Teruhi, the woman with a kind heart but unrequited ""love"" for Jinzaburoh. Upon the many scenes of the Mongolian Invasion, one army after another, both the exiles and Princess Teruhi\'s men and villagers must somehow diverge the many loopholes they have regarding the foundation of Tsushima Island and its defenses in order to push back the Mongolians just enough to ensure everyone\'s safety.For the story to work, the character cast VAs must be assigned to play the roles well, because the context of war is one that cannot be underestimated, and the sense of realism must be executed well. And with Angolmois, you won\'t be disappointed as every point, be it with the many hidden agendas or secrets it has, all portray the feelings of war with ruggedness, with scary emotions and whatnot to the point of believable-ness.The art and animation is somewhat interesting. Studio NAZ incorporated a paper filter into the artwork, which explains why the historical art aspect is kept consistent and true to the real events past. The animation doesn\'t disappoint as many historical-action series does with all of the blood and gore of exterminating enemies and the such, and it all incorporates to give the realism of war, that when confronted, it is right at your face and you can do nothing about it, but just to adapt and fight your way out of this massacre (male army veterans can liaise with this).The music, especially the OST, is more mellow but yet still holds out strong. Never have I expected anything from a war-ravaged anime OST to stand out, but yet this does with the gradual-eclipse of the OP and the all-purposes illustration of the ED about not just the main cast, but their silhouettes showcasing their efforts to stand together as one.All in all, Angolmois is not a groundbreaking show, but yet it still manages to strike a chord all the way through from beginning to end. As is for a war-centric series, there is foreseen plot prediction, but with the kicker being the unexplained events of dire consequences of the dangerous war, it\'s always satisfying to learn as of such that war forces us, the viewers to learn to think twice and not just be strategic, for demise can come at an easy cost.I enjoyed this series much, and you should too, so go catch up on this series, it\'s brutal yet entertaining. the upcoming invasion.

That is the gist of the story.Sounds good enough, right?So I expected a bit more serious war-story, with reason I\'d like to think.You know, plans, tactics, mind-games, stealth, trickery, sabotage, top 10 anime betrayals, grim reality of war and death...serious things.Yeah, you get none of that, really.The...conflict is between two teams of most unique characters, one on the side of the Mongs, one on the side of the Japs.I say ""unique"" but they\'re really the typical ""special"" kind of anime characters, sticking out like a sore thumb in every way possible.Wearing ridiculous outfits, being the only blonde/white haired character, being 120cm short anorexic midgetor being 250 tall bull on a steady steroid diet, or being the beautiful, compassionate and determined flower of a princess whom everyone wants to shag at first glance...no, not even kidding, it\'s a thing here.If they stick out, they\'re important.Their abilities are similarly anime-esque. Night vision, inhuman swordsmanship, casually hopping a hundred meters, wearing plot armor and defying logic like some godline beings.Now, let me just quickly remind you all it\'s a ~~historical~~ show with no ""magic"" involved. They\'re perfectly average human beings who break world records with ease. FYI the record of distance jumping is just shy of 9 meters, so doing ~200m in armor is about 22 times that.If that\'s historical, then so is The Lord of The Rings.Anyway, they\'ll all massacre countless faceless, no-name troops who are really only there to be killed and let these Uniques stick out even more, and their actions will be justified.Speaking of actions, at some point I thought there will be a couple of characters, the ""heroes"" who\'ll play the role of the genius tactician and save the day in the face of overwhelming opposition, and well, I was kind of right.Just kind of, because the show does try to portray them genius even though their actions are anything but.In fact they are just as idiotic as the actions of their polar opposites, the first antagonists the ""heroes"" had to face: the arrogant, possibly retarded figureheads who think they know literally everything better because reasons, like being ""royalty"", or not being on death row. Except Patrick Star levels of retardedness.However, lucky for them all, no matter how stupid they might be or how much they screw it up,as long as they really believe in their actions,as long as it comes from their hearts,as long as they give it their best shot,their actions will be justified, forgiven, described as bravery, they will be hailed (or remembered) as heroes.Even if they kinda just pointlessly lose, say, half an army in like 10 minutes in an obviously suicidal and wholly unnecessary engagement.*HE BE A HERO WOHOOO*Visuals...Someone decided to try and make the visuals look more ""authentic"" by adding a crumpled, brown paper-like static overlay.Someone should be out of a job. It\'s a headache inducing eyesore, really, nothing else.Otherwise the animation\'s okay-ish, art style is just meh, but it shouldn\'t make-or-break the series.Sounds are OK-ish at best, too much shouting when not necessary in a fairly unbelievable tone but otherwise VAs did fine. Music was utterly forgettable.In the end, I feel like I\'ve wasted my time spending 4 episodes on it when one would\'ve been plenty enough. Unlike Sponge Bob which is obviously meant to be a stupid joke, this show tries to be serious, without giving up on the stupid nonsense, so it fails spectacularly.But make no mistake, I do not hate this show.That\'s not because I\'m willing to forgive its atrocious stupidity, it\'s inconsistency, its generic nature, or any other of its many flaws.It\'s because it made no attempt to make me like, care, or be curious about any of the characters, or the story. At the end of the day, I walked away simply not caring about any of it.I wouldn\'t really recommend it to anyone over 13 or so. conflict is between two teams of most unique characters, one on the side of the Mongs, one on the side of the Japs.I say ""unique"" but they\'re really the typical ""special"" kind of anime characters, sticking out like a sore thumb in every way possible.Wearing ridiculous outfits, being the only blonde/white haired character, being 120cm short anorexic midgetor being 250 tall bull on a steady steroid diet, or being the beautiful, compassionate and determined flower of a princess whom everyone wants to shag at first glance...no, not even kidding, it\'s a thing here.If they stick out, they\'re important.Their abilities are similarly anime-esque.

We have princesses, different opinions and ninjas with sword. All that cool stuff in one packet. The first possible setup that comes to your mind after thinking about a story related to these factors, is -- with extra high accuracy -- the plot of this series.The characters have been polished beyond belief so that not even single soul could mistake their purpose in the series to be actual real persons with personalities. The main character looks like a tryhard attempt to not be anything like Furuta Sasuke...(Hyouge Mono) or Xin Li (Kingdom).Thus far, this series is a rather weak take on its genre. Suffering massively from the lack of build up and world building, centering around characters which have given us zero reasons to care about their shit and reasons to fight. On top of that, the source material for this has been running for 5 years, yet the anime will only be 12 episodes. There are little to no changes of it getting any better. I am also certain it won\'t achieve anything during its runtime.This series also contains the single most pathetic attempt to capture raining in animation. I am fairly sure they had 4 pieces of transparent membrane which they further gave to a family of rabies-infected cats that attacked and scratched them for several days until they died. After this was done, they filtered he video thru these 4 papers by swapping them 76 times a second in randomly generated order. ""Looks like rain to me."" About half of all scenes are filtered with highly visible filters that look like there is a still layer of wax paper over the actual anime. It was so weird I had to check from several sources if the raw file was just fucked, but apparently no, it\'s all intentional. Perhaps the production can be blamed for the series to suck so hard from other factors, too.Despite all the problems the series has, for some reasons that are beyond my understanding: I don\'t hate this anime, instead have been able to enjoy most it, and for some reason, am interested to know how this season will actually end. For that reason, I conclude this is just mediocrity and not terrible. (Hyouge Mono) or Xin Li (Kingdom).Thus far, this series is a rather weak take on its genre.

Its Spoiler Free and I\'ll try to keep it Short.""One does not judge an anime by its rating as mere numbers can not justify a show"" - Sun Tzu lolThis is basically of Ghost of Tsushima : the Anime, not even Joking. When I was searching I was very surprised to find an anime that also takes place in Tsushima around the same war. This Historical Fiction anime is underrated both in rating and in popularity. I honestly don\'t care about ratings but the score for this one is absolutely ridiculous. There are worse shows which are higher. I was...expecting it to be bad but it actually turned out pretty good.Story (8.5/10) : The story takes place in 1274, during the First Mongol invasion of Tsushima. A group of exiles land on the Island of Tsushima and join forces with the princess of the Island in the war against the Mongols. Every episode has a lot of action and didn\'t feel boring at any time. It\'s a small Japanese army against a Ton of mongols so they have to be smart on their approach. There are betrayals, alliances, tactics and people actually dying. It portrays the cruelties and the grievances of war. The Ending for this one was pretty good and kinda realistic if u think about it.Characters (8/10): There are lots of characters in this anime yet somehow they fit them all in the span of 12 eps. The best character is undoubtedly the main character Jinzaburou Kuchii who was a former General for the shogunate (not a spoiler). He is smart, perceptive and a badass. It\'s fun watching him whether he\'s building a strategy or just slashing through a Horde! Then there\'s the Princess who invited them in who\'s also a Tsundere, The Exiles which include a Ronin, A Big ogrey man, A Sly Thief, A Tree climber etc. There are various other clans too.I always like shows where the bad guys are NOT portrayed as Douchebags but as individuals who also have goals. This is one of them. For Eg, there\'s Uriyanedei a Fat Mongol General or smt who appears to be a cool guy who isn\'t exactly \'evil\' but happens to be on the opposite side. Also shocked seeing a bad guy getting protected by plot armor twice (you don\'t get to see that often)Visuals (7/10) : The biggest complaints are the visuals. While it\'s on par, it has this wierd filter that\'s on at all times. It gives a Medieval look but also looks wierd. Although u\'ll get used to it after a couple of eps. The artstyle is actually pretty good especially for the female characters. The animation is OK. It\'s evident that it\'s kinda low budget. But they tried something new with the filter and didn\'t use as much CG as u\'d think in a show about wars so props for that.Sound and Music (8/10) : This was a chance to use traditional music but instead they went to Orchestral-ish music which isn\'t bad. The Op and Ed are both Decent. The Voice acting is good. Especially on Jin. Also the Mongols speak Japanese lol.Enjoyment (9/10): Like I said it wasn\'t boring at any time, each episode has an awesome ending and the actual ending while it was sad it was also kinda satisfying.Overall: It\'s a fun watch. Even though it\'s a Historical Fiction, it has quite a lot of accuracy too like the Mongols have beefy blades and they use Tubular Hand Cannons. Both the Japanese and Mongol Armor look authentic for that era. Although Mongol Archers aren\'t portrayed as skilled Archers, they kinda do but not really lol. The show has its ups and downs but not as bad as the rating claims. If u liked Ghost Of Tsushima or even Drifters, u need to watch this. Wish there was more of it.I was gonna give a 8 but I think I\'ll bump it up to 9/10 since it\'s very underrated. expecting it to be bad but it actually turned out pretty good.Story (8.5/10) : The story takes place in 1274, during the First Mongol invasion of Tsushima.

It's based off of the events of the first Mongolian invasion of Japan from 1274. So, this was back when Kublai Khan was running things. But enough history, the anime adaptation was handled by NAZ. One of those rare anime studios that I haven't seen anything from. Let's see how strong of an introduction this is.Story:Our narrative is set on Tsushima Island. We follow a group of Japanese exiles who are being sent for the sole purpose of serving as troops against the incoming Mongolians. They soon find themselves as a small unit trying...to stay in hiding and avoid the larger, more powerful Mongolian force.Now, it makes sense from a narrative perspective to follow a small, guerilla force since it's pretty well known that Tsushima fell very quickly during the first Mongolian invasion. The problem this has, as a narrative, is that there are literally a million characters and none of them are memorable.

It's like they want to visually marry the idea of an old sepia toned samurai drama to modern animation techniques. So, the colours are a bit muted and the whole series just looks a bit off, visually.

I also could not say it looks good.Sound:The acting is decent enough. You won't get highly skilled, emotionally deep performances. Even though there are some amazing actors like Ishida Akira & Koyasu Takehito. There are also plenty of good actors we've heard give strong performances before.

But, the only thing I will say about this, is watch it for yourself, and see how absolutely gory, bloody, and amazingly action packed this historical piece actually is, I promise,...you will definitely not be disappointed at all. Well, I wasn't, I do which however this anime was longer. That's one downside to anime like these, they are so good, but always end up being short, which sucks.

The following review is my opinion, please don\'t murder me with words.Story: 6/10Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Character: 3/10Enjoyment: 4/10Overall: 5/10Mediocre anime, life is short, definitely not anime of the season. To be fair, this season hasn\'t been the most amazing (omitting OL3 and SnK3)....I feel the need to write a review because everywhere I go, I seem to see people praising this as a \'underrated anime\' and that it\'s the best of the season or whatever. But to be honest, I definitely don\'t think it deserves this. It\'s just so bland and generic. The tactics that the main character thinks up are absolutely logical. But that\'s why it\'s so boring, ""night raid"", ""defend this chokepoint"", ""guerrilla warfare"". This is all logical, it\'s not ingenius, and the number of people I see going ""how smart of Jinzaburo"" just makes me cringe. Also, people should take the historical accuracy of this anime with a grain of salt, but that\'s as expected, it\'s an anime, not a documentary.The cheap film grain used over the episodes made it feel like it was made in a basement, definitely not an amazing artistic direction. The animation wasn\'t the best, in the action scenes, there are lots of random jump cuts, and that makes the scenes very jarring. There is no impact to any attacks, and of course, the main character just cleaves through all the enemies. Also, the stupid mouth flapping.Nothing too memorable from the soundtrack, opening and ending were pretty good I guess. But I think the most important issue is character developments. There is pretty much none. There\'re a few exiles that we meet, that look like they might be interesting, such as the big dude, and the tiny dude. Seriously, I don\'t even remember their names, they are so unimportant, they\'re mentioned once, and then literally disappear. Seriously, the big dude disappears for a whole episode to go to the toilet and nobody even notices. The one character that is developed is the main character, and it\'s pretty vague to be honest until episode 5. Which I am assuming is how he was exiled in the first place. Teruhi is pretty thicc though, I can appreciate that.Can\'t say I enjoyed this anime, I usually enjoy historical animes, as you can see with my Yoichi no Nasu profile picture... I love historical animes, they\'re absolutely brilliant. Animes like Drifters are how they should be made, with a cast of interesting characters and powerful action scenes, with ACTUAL genius tactics.

The potential that this series had was ultimately pulled back by some dumb editor that thought adding a dirt cloud filter would make the 'classic' look they're aiming for look more believable. With that said, it still did not dragged the overall enjoyment I had with the show.With a strong story arc and character designs for a grounded anime, I could say that this is my pick for underrated anime of the season. Again, ignoring that dumb filter, the art was good. It serves it's purpose and character designs was memorable enough to make...me wanna cosplay a few of the characters. Sword fights are short, but speaking under a realistic perspective, a sword fight really won't last long more than a few exchanges. I appreciate the lack of obvious CGI too. The lack of blood after chopping limbs off are a bit of a disappointment though.I was not a fan of the opening and ending music at first but it eventually grew on me. Sound editing was great though. You can feel the tension specially in the later episodes when things got real, real quick.Characters are developed enough for you to care when lives are in danger. Our main man Jinzaburou got some backstory in a few flashbacks. Exiles never got that luxury but the way they've been written made me care about them. Nagamine, Hitari, Amushi, Tatsu and hell even Shiraishi, all had moments however short they may be (like Tatsu).I really enjoyed the show. Best episode was episode 11. I hope when they release this officially, they'll removed that damn filter. I could easily give this a 9 if not for that damn filter. Still recommend. 8/10 me wanna cosplay a few of the characters.

Other than the setting and the main conflict, history really rides in the back seat whilst flashy fight scenes and the 'rule of cool' drive and work the radio.That's not to say I learned nothing from Angolmois or it did a bad job at portraying the period; early gunpowder is on display to the bamboozlement of the Japanese defenders, the multi-racial nature of the Mongol invading force was front and center, and there's even a bit of alt-history at work in one episode that...caught me by surprise. Sure, there was also scenes where the martial men of Tsushima marveled at a bamboo spear like it was space magic, but that lay more as a problem with the writers trying to emphasize the tactical brilliance of Kuchii.On this point, the writing was rather trite. At best, it would work to make the exile group a kind of A-team where everyone boiled down to a specialization they added to a war party whose fight against the odds and small, interpersonal nature would give it a Spartacus or Braveheart vibe. When it wasn't at its best, which was most of the time, characters were either bland and unbelieveable, short sighted or prideful to the point of absurdity, or killed off when they begin to be useful or likeable. Just to name a few examples of this, the Sou clan spends most of the show ostracizing the exiles who are saving them, one of the exiles insists on producing penis humorisms to the point of obsession, enemy officers who look like Fire Emblem baddies make grand appearances and then disappear for most of the series, Kuchii is given constant screentime towards how virtuous and powerful until he's become a Mary Sue, the princess vacillates between Damsel and Anti-Damsel and is obnoxious as both, and romance interactions are more like what you'd see in a highschool sitcom than a samurai flick.The art and sound design were pretty bog standard; sappy score, drawn sections having a few hiccups but otherwise being quite serviceable, 3d being used as a time-saver on things with lots of movement like blood sprays, flags, and ships. They even took the time to model the completely-doesn't-disfigure-our-chiseled-handsome-hero face scars to be persistent through the series, which was a nice touch. The main critique levelled for the show's art tends to be the papyrus-esque filter they overlaid. It can vary from being glaring to not being really noticeable, though I think it's more sad that it indicates the studio either lacked the heart or the resources to render the show in a more historical art style and thus tried to literally plaster 'old timeyness' over what is otherwise a run of the mill action title.If you really go for works in the time period or action shows in general, you might get something more out of Angolmois than I did.

But eventhough they are very stereotypical (the archer, the brute, the greedy merchant, the Shaolin monk etc.) they look cool and you will root for them.The animation itself is good but for some reason, they decided to draw everything on...a background of old parchment (or something like that). You will get used to it in time but it is distracting during scenes where the camera moves. (I know there's no camera but you get it).It commits a lot of the typical historical anime follies (overusage of archers, plot armor, unrealistic in-battle movement) but nothing too over the top. It also manages at times to show how formidable the Mongols were and doesn't portray them as mindless zombies (for the most part)One thing to praise here is the dialogue which is really good and enhances the overall enjoyment and score. It is through the dialogue the story and characters keep you engaged eventhough it is in itself not as strong.In conclusion, this anime is a very good bingeworthy experience with great dialogue, action and worldbuilding. The thing that keeps it from becoming great overall is the fact, that all it's other aspects are falling behind. a background of old parchment (or something like that).

If you got as far as the reviews, it means you\'re prepared to do just that. Please do. The synopsis makes this anime sound like it was churned out of a mill, with no real character, heart, or anything intriguing to make it stand out. But that is very far from the truth. Not only does it exceed the impression made by the synopsis, but it also exceeds the expectations of a ""historical"" anime. It stands on its own quite firmly. Has a 7 Samurai feel to it. If 7 Samurai meets Suicide Squad meets Rambo sounds like something you would like,...it\'s definitely worth a watch. it\'s definitely worth a watch.', 'I primarily enjoyed this anime because of Kuchii Jinzaburou.  He was an excellent MC and I wish there were more MC\'s like him.  He was savage, yet intelligent.  He was charismatic, yet fierce.  A wolf of war finding his humanity in the midst of a dire situation.  He pretty much carried this entire anime and it would have been utter trash without him.The other strong point of the anime was the story.  It\'s not as though a Japanese War-Time story is new or groundbreaking, but this one was told well. (Up until the end, anyway).  But,...it didn\'t falter until the very, very end when it got kind of mystical and flash-backy and the final battle between Jinzaburou and one of the Mongol generals was the very definition of pointless and ""meh"".  But, the story was a strong point of the anime, overall.Everything else though?  Kind of garbage.  I have no idea whose idea it was to overlay some kind of papery film over the entire animation, but it was a bad idea that made the anime look cheap and it wasn\'t exactly on the level of a Land of the Lustrous when it came to animation to begin with.The cast was completely and totally forgettable other than the Princess and Onitakemaru.  I could barely even remember their names.  The whole island was filled with ""Japanese Warrior A"", ""Japanese Warrior B"" casting.  Interchangeable personalities, basic dialog, with only the motivation to survive (Which makes sense considering they\'re under invasion) but still, the cast was completely forgettable outside of those three.Still, in spite of its flaws, an anime really just needs two things to be enjoyable: A good lead and a good story and this anime had both.  So, while there\'s a lot of other better animes out there to watch, I think those who like Samurai animes will enjoy this one.  Though, if you like Samurai animes, you probably are the type to already know what happened on Tsushima during the Mongol Invasion, so the ending will be predictable.Story: 9Art: 3Sound: 5Character: 5Enjoyment: 7Overall: 7 it didn\'t falter until the very, very end when it got kind of mystical and flash-backy and the final battle between Jinzaburou and one of the Mongol generals was the very definition of pointless and ""meh"".

Sign me up!', ""Angolmois is a pretty typical historical action series, and while it does some things well, it really struggles to stand out from the crowd. Beginning with the story, it is this show's strongest aspect, though that's not necessarily high praise. The viewer is presented with a fictionalized account of the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1271, focusing specifically on the isle of Tsushima, and the struggle that a group of former prisoners go through in order to resist them and grow not only as warriors, but people. Beginning with the good, the battle strategy is interesting, the setting is cool, the dialogue is fairly well-written,...and the foundational event is an example of humanity at both its best and worst, with an underlying message that is inspiring and life-affirming. However, the pacing is rushed, it gets carried away with fictional elements while attempting to cling to a veneer of historicity to the point of inventing a whole class of secret mountain warriors called the Toi Barai, and it uses cheap shock value as a crutch for mediocre storytelling, especially towards the second half of the show. In light of these factors, the story amounts to nothing special, only just managing to provide enough material off of which the rest of the show can subsist. Having said all that about the story, I do want to reiterate that it isn't strictly bad, it's just not anything special. In fact, for most of the show it remains somewhat entertaining, weighed down as a whole by some worse episodes later on. The art is fair, meeting most basic standards of quality, with exciting and well-choreographed fight scenes that grab the viewer's attention. However, it occasionally suffers from the 'dreaded mask', a phenomenon in anime where facial animation is seriously lacking. Though, its worst artistic sin is the static overlay of crumpled paper throughout, intended to provide an air of antiquity to the work and improve its aesthetic character. Here, all it manages to do is diminish the visual impact and overall clarity of most scenes. Indeed, it's sometimes even distracting, especially when the eyes latch on to one feature of the paper overlay in one way or another and fixate on it, as though your screen is dirty or has a dead pixel. The sound, like everything else, meets all the basic standards of quality, with good music and sounds of life, which excel in battle scenes to accentuate the clanging of metal and the cracking of bone. The characters are broadly okay, if a little one-dimensional, and I don't really have any complaints. Among them, the best characters are Kuchii and Amushi. Kuchii, as the main character, is the major driving force of this show, fulfilling his predictable yet regardless entertaining role as the resident snarky badass with a tragic past. Amushi, however, is a supporting character that doesn't get a lot of development until the middle of the show. While he is significant through his duties as a scout, he is compelling for his motivations and personality, which are more interesting and realistic than most other characters in the anime. Overall, Angolmois is just okay, with good and bad throughout. If you take anything away from this review, remember that this anime is not bad, it's just not anything more than what it is- unremarkable. and the foundational event is an example of humanity at both its best and worst, with an underlying message that is inspiring and life-affirming.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Crystal,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14751/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_Crystal,"['I wanted to love this. After the waiting, the uncertainty, biblically-proportioned flood of 20th anniversary merchandise... this wasn\'t a case of hype killing an experience. Sailor Moon Crystal is an unmitigated disaster in almost every way imaginable.Let\'s address the biggest, pinkest elephant in the room from the start: the artwork. I think what happened here was an ambitious idea (trying to mimic Naoko Takeuchi\'s elaborate manga style in animation) with poor planning and sloppy execution. Visually speaking, they missed the mark. Right from the teaser, people rightfully pointed out that something was off. The first episode looks mostly fine-- not amazing, but ok-- and then...it\'s like they animators gave up. The artwork flipflops between beautiful and cringeworthy. I\'ve seen plenty of cheap animation in my life, but the bad art in Sailor Moon Crystal isn\'t just mediocre, it is painful to look upon. This is especially tragic because it\'s clear that this series could have been stunning. Seriously, go watch the Moon Pride music video and compare it to any scene in the anime. It could have all looked that good, if someone had cared.But nobody cared.Things move, but the only thing that really gets loving animation is Sailor Moon\'s hair. Nobody\'s walk cycles look quite right, ever, and a lot of the time, no one seems grounded in the environments. A lot of ""animation"" is accomplished by having still images pan across the screen or stretch/shrink, to unintentional comedic effect. Fight scenes show a bit more effort than the classic anime\'s JRPG-style ""stock attack footage, villain reaction, rinse and repeat"" fights, but still seem to cut away at moments that would be inconvenient to animate.The excuses for Crystal\'s moldy potato quality are thin. The old series was low-budget, rush-it-in-a-week animation from the 90\'s. The manga was yet unfinished, and they pumped out filler episodes to compensate. Physical, painted cels would have to be completely redone to correct any errors. By contrast, Sailor Moon Crystal episodes were produced in two weeks instead of one. The source material is complete. The animation is digital, which allows for much quicker and easier corrections. Technology has given us better, more efficient ways to animate in the last 20 years. Even a lot of the art ""fixes"" for the Blu-Ray are mediocre at best. I feel like a decade down the road we might hear horror stories about animating on Sailor Moon Crystal, like that they were paid in ketchup packets and forced to work 23-hour shifts and every misshapen face is a scream of protest.Also, the CG henshin sequences use these weird, rubbery 3D models of the senshi that look like they belong in a cheap video game. They don\'t quite look like their 2D selves, their faces are creepy and doll-like, and transformations are just low-effort rehashes of the transformation scenes from the first anime. They aren\'t fun. It\'s just not fun to watch a crappy CG senshi twirl around like a plastic bag in a breeze with mediocre special effects. Sailor Moon\'s henshin sequences are an icon-- of the series, of the genre, and of anime in general. I\'d wager almost anyone that saw Sailor Moon, even if it was ages ago and they haven\'t thought about it since they were a child, probably remembers the henshin sequences. You put effort and budget into something like that because your viewers are going to see it every episode. That Crystal fails to deliver, even here, is a clear indicator that nobody took any pride in this mess.Unfortunately, the story is as unsalvageable as the visuals. The 90\'s anime was notorious for its filler (though the filler is part of what endeared us all so much to its characters). Sailor Moon Crystal ran too far in the opposite direction, deciding to squeeze two story arcs into one 26-episode season. It\'s extremely condensed. One manga chapter can not always equal one anime episode; things just don\'t work that way. While it\'s true that the manga, which Crystal is heavily based on, is pretty fast-paced, the manga has a fairy-tale feel to it and still manages to be engaging and emotional though its much more expressive artwork. Meanwhile, most every character drawn in Crystal has the emotional depth and subtlety of an emoticon. The story itself is so excited to get to its next nostalgic plot destination and say, ""Look how we did it THIS time!"" that it forgets the journey, and the journey is the most important part.Crystal takes no time to linger or to build its characters. Everyone but Usagi is a cardboard stand-up, pared down to their most basic traits. The inner senshi, after their introductions, are flattened so badly their dialogue becomes interchangeable, and by the climax of the first arc, they are literally just finishing every sentence together. It\'s like the writers wrote dialogue for one person and cut it up into little pieces so the poor things would all have lines, like a grade school play for a class with too many children. The senshi exist as little more than cheerleaders for Usagi, and any moments of  personal achievement they were given in the manga are handed off to Sailor Moon. (Forget about this series as an adaptation of the manga: it diverges, pointlessly, all the time. Anyone who says it\'s ""accurate to the manga"" didn\'t read the manga.)Because Crystal makes its characters strangers to us, drama comes off as melodrama, and any moment meant to be meaningful or touching flops. It lacks any emotional truth; it gives you no reason to care about what\'s happening. It\'s a series that sort of spoon feeds you what you\'re supposed to feel about the characters and the story, but never actually goes out of its way to create those feelings. Humor is almost absent, and feels forced or out of place when it happens. Characters pass the idiot ball around, with plot threads hinging mostly on their cluelessness-- especially Usagi, who we are meant to adore, and who the senshi praise mindlessly at every turn, even though this incarnation of her is annoying, selfish, and pathetic.That\'s really one of the worst parts; Sailor Moon herself is no longer a good role model. The Sailor Moon I knew was a ditzy, clumsy, silly girl with a heart of gold and the capacity for infinite love and bravery, a person who lifted others up, drew them together, and still fought for them even when she was all alone. She started out childish and selfish, but she always came through for her friends and grew immensely over the course of the series. Crystal!Usagi is obsessed with Mamoru and frequently forgets about or outright ignores her friends while they get tossed around by baddies. The most she seems to be able to say about them is that they\'re beautiful. And while she\'s still an airheaded klutz, it\'s not cute or charming anymore, because she\'s so thoroughly unlikable. She doesn\'t seem to care about anything other than her own feelings and desires. She\'s just a witless, bratty child that never changes and never learns and gets exactly what she wants anyway. The senshi\'s unthinking devotion to her is downright eerie, like they\'ve been brainwashed to worship her, because she is so obviously unworthy of their adoration. Even Rei, critical of Usagi and at first suspicious of the whole sailor senshi thing in every previous incarnation, doesn\'t seem to have a single doubt about Usagi as their leader. Sailor Moon Crystal successfully made me hate a character that I previously loved and would have defended until blue in the face. Sailor Moon is my least favorite character in an anime named after her.Incidentally: there is also a hackneyed, half-assed romance subplot involving all of the senshi, executed poorly of course because Crystal doesn\'t have the time or the dexterity to handle 8 not-Usagi characters\' subplots. The theme song claims they don\'t need princes to save them, but the senshi are more dependent on men than they have ever been. I don\'t think Sailor Moon has ever been the perfect flawless feminist holy grail that some people make it out to be, but this version is a step backwards in comparison to the others. For a specific example, a panel with a consensual kiss between Usagi and Mamoru is converted into an animated scene where Mamoru forces a kiss on Usagi while she tries to push him away. Miracle romance!The main plot itself is ass pull after ass pull after deus ex machina. Admittedly, this is a staple of Sailor Moon, but with a rushed story, cardboard characters, downright ugly animation and basically nothing likable or exciting to hold on to, it\'s kind of the final nail in the coffin. There\'s no charm left to save it. The story itself hasn\'t aged that well-- it needed some updating that just didn\'t happen. Imagine Crystal under a different name, and you get a shabby imitation of the classic anime and a weak contender in a genre that it revolutionized. And that\'s terrible.Also, other than the catchy OP/ED, the music is forgettable. Having heard some of the other soundtracks Yasuharu Takanashi has worked on, it sounds phoned-in. The music never strongly ties itself to any scenes, even the transformation sequences. Most of my music collection is anime soundtracks, and I can\'t say I even remember most of Crystal\'s.I spent a lot of time being patient and forgiving with this series. I managed to convince myself I was enjoying it for about seven episodes. There are a select good moments that have made me smile or laugh, but they\'re chocolate chips in a pile of gravel. It makes me sad that this shallow, lifeless adaptation of the manga is how a lot of people are going to get introduced to Sailor Moon. The original manga story is a gem that could be easily polished, but nobody bothered.This series was not given the respect or care that it deserves. Those two years of secrecy and delays were frustrating, but not nearly as frustrating as the result: a soulless, slapdash mess, a totally transparent cash grab (as clearly indicated by the ridiculous price gouging on the BDs). It\'s the anime equivalent of a cheap bath gift set-- presented like it\'s luxurious and classy, but it\'s just glorified hand soap.  As a long-time Sailor Moon fan, it\'s hard for me to evaluate Crystal without comparing it to other incarnations, but as a reboot for such a popular, long-lived franchise, it\'s a massive letdown. Toei played us for chumps.The best I can hope for at this point is that people will watch it, realize it\'s terrible, and check out the classic anime or the manga or PGSM.WHAT I LEARNED IN BOATING SCHOOL IS: Sometimes the things you loved were fine the way they were. I didn\'t spend my days longing for a new Sailor Moon anime before I knew it was happening. And now that it exists, I mostly wish it didn\'t. Maybe it\'s ok for good things to be over. Maybe I\'m wiser now. Maybe I just spent $15 on a gashapon Cutie Moon Rod. Don\'t judge me. it\'s like they animators gave up. The artwork flipflops between beautiful and cringeworthy. I\'ve seen plenty of cheap animation in my life, but the bad art in Sailor Moon Crystal isn\'t just mediocre, it is painful to look upon. This is especially tragic because it\'s clear that this series could have been stunning. Seriously, go watch the Moon Pride music video and compare it to any scene in the anime. It could have all looked that good, if someone had cared.But nobody cared.Things move, but the only thing that really gets loving animation is Sailor Moon\'s hair. Nobody\'s walk cycles look quite right, ever, and a lot of the time, no one seems grounded in the environments. A lot of ""animation"" is accomplished by having still images pan across the screen or stretch/shrink, to unintentional comedic effect. Fight scenes show a bit more effort than the classic anime\'s JRPG-style ""stock attack footage, villain reaction, rinse and repeat"" fights, but still seem to cut away at moments that would be inconvenient to animate.The excuses for Crystal\'s moldy potato quality are thin. The old series was low-budget, rush-it-in-a-week animation from the 90\'s. The manga was yet unfinished, and they pumped out filler episodes to compensate. Physical, painted cels would have to be completely redone to correct any errors. By contrast, Sailor Moon Crystal episodes were produced in two weeks instead of one. The source material is complete. The animation is digital, which allows for much quicker and easier corrections. Technology has given us better, more efficient ways to animate in the last 20 years. Even a lot of the art ""fixes"" for the Blu-Ray are mediocre at best. I feel like a decade down the road we might hear horror stories about animating on Sailor Moon Crystal, like that they were paid in ketchup packets and forced to work 23-hour shifts and every misshapen face is a scream of protest.Also, the CG henshin sequences use these weird, rubbery 3D models of the senshi that look like they belong in a cheap video game. They don\'t quite look like their 2D selves, their faces are creepy and doll-like, and transformations are just low-effort rehashes of the transformation scenes from the first anime. They aren\'t fun. It\'s just not fun to watch a crappy CG senshi twirl around like a plastic bag in a breeze with mediocre special effects. Sailor Moon\'s henshin sequences are an icon-- of the series, of the genre, and of anime in general. I\'d wager almost anyone that saw Sailor Moon, even if it was ages ago and they haven\'t thought about it since they were a child, probably remembers the henshin sequences. You put effort and budget into something like that because your viewers are going to see it every episode. That Crystal fails to deliver, even here, is a clear indicator that nobody took any pride in this mess.Unfortunately, the story is as unsalvageable as the visuals. The 90\'s anime was notorious for its filler (though the filler is part of what endeared us all so much to its characters). Sailor Moon Crystal ran too far in the opposite direction, deciding to squeeze two story arcs into one 26-episode season. It\'s extremely condensed. One manga chapter can not always equal one anime episode; things just don\'t work that way. While it\'s true that the manga, which Crystal is heavily based on, is pretty fast-paced, the manga has a fairy-tale feel to it and still manages to be engaging and emotional though its much more expressive artwork. Meanwhile, most every character drawn in Crystal has the emotional depth and subtlety of an emoticon. The story itself is so excited to get to its next nostalgic plot destination and say, ""Look how we did it THIS time!"" that it forgets the journey, and the journey is the most important part.Crystal takes no time to linger or to build its characters. Everyone but Usagi is a cardboard stand-up, pared down to their most basic traits. The inner senshi, after their introductions, are flattened so badly their dialogue becomes interchangeable, and by the climax of the first arc, they are literally just finishing every sentence together. It\'s like the writers wrote dialogue for one person and cut it up into little pieces so the poor things would all have lines, like a grade school play for a class with too many children. The senshi exist as little more than cheerleaders for Usagi, and any moments of  personal achievement they were given in the manga are handed off to Sailor Moon. (Forget about this series as an adaptation of the manga: it diverges, pointlessly, all the time. Anyone who says it\'s ""accurate to the manga"" didn\'t read the manga.)Because Crystal makes its characters strangers to us, drama comes off as melodrama, and any moment meant to be meaningful or touching flops. It lacks any emotional truth; it gives you no reason to care about what\'s happening. It\'s a series that sort of spoon feeds you what you\'re supposed to feel about the characters and the story, but never actually goes out of its way to create those feelings. Humor is almost absent, and feels forced or out of place when it happens. Characters pass the idiot ball around, with plot threads hinging mostly on their cluelessness-- especially Usagi, who we are meant to adore, and who the senshi praise mindlessly at every turn, even though this incarnation of her is annoying, selfish, and pathetic.That\'s really one of the worst parts; Sailor Moon herself is no longer a good role model. The Sailor Moon I knew was a ditzy, clumsy, silly girl with a heart of gold and the capacity for infinite love and bravery, a person who lifted others up, drew them together, and still fought for them even when she was all alone. She started out childish and selfish, but she always came through for her friends and grew immensely over the course of the series. Crystal!Usagi is obsessed with Mamoru and frequently forgets about or outright ignores her friends while they get tossed around by baddies. The most she seems to be able to say about them is that they\'re beautiful. And while she\'s still an airheaded klutz, it\'s not cute or charming anymore, because she\'s so thoroughly unlikable. She doesn\'t seem to care about anything other than her own feelings and desires. She\'s just a witless, bratty child that never changes and never learns and gets exactly what she wants anyway. The senshi\'s unthinking devotion to her is downright eerie, like they\'ve been brainwashed to worship her, because she is so obviously unworthy of their adoration. Even Rei, critical of Usagi and at first suspicious of the whole sailor senshi thing in every previous incarnation, doesn\'t seem to have a single doubt about Usagi as their leader. Sailor Moon Crystal successfully made me hate a character that I previously loved and would have defended until blue in the face. Sailor Moon is my least favorite character in an anime named after her.Incidentally: there is also a hackneyed, half-assed romance subplot involving all of the senshi, executed poorly of course because Crystal doesn\'t have the time or the dexterity to handle 8 not-Usagi characters\' subplots. The theme song claims they don\'t need princes to save them, but the senshi are more dependent on men than they have ever been. I don\'t think Sailor Moon has ever been the perfect flawless feminist holy grail that some people make it out to be, but this version is a step backwards in comparison to the others. For a specific example, a panel with a consensual kiss between Usagi and Mamoru is converted into an animated scene where Mamoru forces a kiss on Usagi while she tries to push him away. Miracle romance!The main plot itself is ass pull after ass pull after deus ex machina. Admittedly, this is a staple of Sailor Moon, but with a rushed story, cardboard characters, downright ugly animation and basically nothing likable or exciting to hold on to, it\'s kind of the final nail in the coffin. There\'s no charm left to save it. The story itself hasn\'t aged that well-- it needed some updating that just didn\'t happen. Imagine Crystal under a different name, and you get a shabby imitation of the classic anime and a weak contender in a genre that it revolutionized. And that\'s terrible.Also, other than the catchy OP/ED, the music is forgettable. Having heard some of the other soundtracks Yasuharu Takanashi has worked on, it sounds phoned-in. The music never strongly ties itself to any scenes, even the transformation sequences. Most of my music collection is anime soundtracks, and I can\'t say I even remember most of Crystal\'s.I spent a lot of time being patient and forgiving with this series.

As a former avid Sailor Moon fan I made it to episode 17 of this series before just completely giving up. It is downright terrible. The art is ugly and everything is so static it reminds me of a low budget flash animation cartoon. Storywise the pacing is dreadful and you\'d think that was because there was too much to fit into this condensed manga-esque chapter structure.. but no, 75% of an episode is Usagi crying or dramatic name shouting.The characters seem braindead. For dramatic purposes in storytelling you often have to have the characters miss a...seemingly obvious bit of information, be a bit oblivious if you will, so that they can get into dramatic situations. I can accept that. I cannot accept an important plot point being divulged blatantly by a nemesis during a battle.. and then later when the group talks about the situation one person brings up what the big-bad said and everyone else has their jaw drop and react as if that\'s the first time and most shocking of news. The way the show is presented it\'s not even ""the next scene"" but sometimes they do something stupid like go to an arcade or have ice cream between the battle and the recap ""stunning revelation"" scene. What\'d you all do?

The first couple of episodes really put me off as I am a big fan of the older series and manga, a remake was music to my ears.The artwork takes a load of time getting used to. Not to mention the 100% CG transformations making the characters look like rubber dolls being stretched to fit their costumes properly.There was really little effort put into every frame in terms of animation that I felt sick to my stomach just watching it, but... as a loyal fan, I swallowed that and continued anyway.As it progresses,...they improved on the artwork which was a huge relief for me, after all, this IS a remake no? And then here comes the big punch.Yes, they are trying to do justice and provide as much fan service possible for the blockbuster series but I feel that it's rushed and they focused more on Usagi and Mamoru compared to the rest. Every other character deemed pretty much useless. It's all 80% UsaMamo 15% Random story 5% on the other sailor scouts.Overall, it's quite enjoyable. You get to see many scenes and fan service from the manga and the music is amazing, hands down on that.If you are going to compare this to the older series AND manga, please do yourself the favour and do NOT watch it.

This was a huge let down. The animation quality is dreadful, lazy, sloppy and ugly. I think this is best illustrated by Usagi's buns, they are consistently drawn on top of her hair when clearly they should be behind her hair and peaking out over the top; this looks so ugly. Considering major details of the main character are so badly drawn you know what to expect from the rest of the art.The story in the original anime and manga also came across as very kitsch, I think this was a huge part of...its charm. The remake comes across as overbearing and too serious, 0% kitsch.The art tries to emulate the manga style somewhat, but the manga designs where a lot cuter, Takeuchi had a very unique scribbling style of drawing. When these were adapted for the original anime big changes were made but the new designs worked really well in the context. The new designs emulate the manga designs too closely but lacking the charm, they come off almost as bad as modern American CGI.Some things I can't blame on the remake, the manga character development was never a strong point. Everyone but Usagi/Chibi/Marmora are quickly discarded ending up as carbon clones, only there to support the main characters. If anything the original anime managed to improve on this, in spite of major story rewrites being made to target the show at a younger audience than the manga was aimed at.I was really hoping to recapture some of the magic of when I was younger and watched the anime (the german version because it wasn't on UK TV) and read the manga. Rewatching the anime 15 years later in Japanese was still a really joyful experience. Watching this anime is something I'd rather forget about.

Sailor Moon has been the legendary all mighty queen of anime, who has launched a million girls (And lots of boys, and hentai artists) fantasies. Sailor Moon finally returns to her awaited throne with the release of Sailor Moon Crystal. However.....question is. Will she fall off her rightful throne? Let\'s get to it then........Basically Sailor Moon goes through the same story it has been going through since its own first release during the 1990\'s. This time around it follows the story from the manga as close as possible. The best thing about Crystal is that. Crystal finally opens...that much wanted window into some of the characters souls (The main villains) that the 90\'s anime almost closed off completely. Crystal finally shows that much needed side to Queen Beryl, and her cohorts that was illustrated in the original manga. This new reincarnation also answers many questions that many fans have faced ever since they heard that there will be a new Sailor Moon anime. Is this show funny like the 90\'s anime? Well.....there are light hearted moments to be had in Crystal, however things are completely different in that department along with many other areas. Is Chibiusa in Crystal? Not yet, but unfortunately she will arrive soon...........There is a huge problem with this anime, and it feels like a lingering tumor that just won\'t go away. The problem is the animation/production. The facial expressions are almost beyond horrid at times. Sailor Moon, and her bevy of sexy power rangers all look very beautiful. However they sometimes look like blank dolls who are deeply yearning to escape their new prison of CGI, and internet fan boy fantasies. Sure. The animation in this show looks really wonderful at times, and stunning (Especially during the opening credits). It\'s just that sometimes it feels like that the animators have no clue what they are doing here. One moment everything is superbly gorgeous. The next moment everybody in the show seems like they have bells palsy. Eventually this problem gets solved...... and then it comes back yet again. Unfortunately Crystal does not cut it when it tries to give its characters the much needed body language, and emotion that the manga fully expressed flawlessly. Awkward poses, and a limited range of facial emotion really set this show way back.There are some upsides. The story eventually becomes gripping, and emotional (During at least two episodes that is). It strikes the much needed heartfelt cord that Sailor Moon is well known for. And there\'s Tuxedo Kamen..... being Tuxedo Kamen from the manga version, and not the jerk from the old anime (That\'s not really a thing, but it\'s something). The background sounds, and the music is all done greatly. The main theme feels more like a really good heavy metal song. While the ending theme is soothing, and enjoyable to watch. Many fans do not have to wait 5,000 episodes this time around for Jupiter, and Venus to finally show up. Every sailor scout gets introduced during the first few episodes. Plus Sailor Moon evolves/matures just like she does in the manga throughout.On A Personal Note: Listen, this show has to be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, it is Sailor Moon. However that does not automatically label this relaunch ""Amazing"". Hardcore moonies (Including myself) will surely get a big mixed bag of emotions. Some will feel like wanting to like it, but hating it at the same time. Others will just force liking it because they want another season that involves the outer sailor scouts. A lot of fans will be pleased though, because this show follows the context of the manga. While some will just feel like that the wait wasn\'t worth it. I have read the entire manga series, and watched the old Sailor Moon show. I felt pretty crushed a little when I started watching Crystal. When the opening animation sequence started for the first time in my room, I was extremely excited. I was gushing with joy because the sailor scouts look really awesome fighting the forces of evil. Then later on when I saw episodes where Sailor Moon, and then Sailor Mars having the weirdest anime eyes that I have ever seen in my whole life........I then lost hope. The animation is fluid during only fight scenes, but not throughout everything else like the old 90\'s anime was. Even the manga had more facial expressions than this show does, honestly. This show will truly succeed if it can somehow manage to make it to the end of the series. Where Sailor Moon, the character becomes truly amazing. For now this is my review for Crystal, maybe I will change my mind when the next season comes on. Crystal is basically going to be two parts. The first couple of episodes will cover the Dark Kingdom arc (Which is now complete, and which I have now reviewed), and next up will be the Black Moon arc. Hopefully things will turn around during the Black Moon arc, since I really like Sailor Pluto (Come on, don\'t make fun of her.....Pluto will always be a planet in my heart).The only ones who will truly enjoy this anime, are the ones who are new to the Sailor Moon franchise. that much wanted window into some of the characters souls (The main villains) that the 90\'s anime almost closed off completely.

I tried to overlook the always-changing faces, the weird camera angles, the god-awful direction. I tried to stay optimistic, and episode after episode I just told myself I'm overreacting. But no more lies. Time to say it - this anime is bad.Before anybody get's angry - don't get me wrong. Sailor Moon Crystal isn't bad because of the new look, CGI transformations, new voices or new theme music so many people are angry about. These things really don't matter, regardless whether you watched the original 90 version or not.Sailor Moon Crystal is bad because, to put it plainly,...it's very poorly made. VERY. As I mentioned at the beginning, the faces just can't stay consistent. Very often they look weird and out of style, like they were drawn in few seconds just to push the work through. Maybe the very subtle, delicate designs based on the manga are hard to present in motion within the tight budget and strict deadlines the series has (I assume). Maybe they've only have interns working on this. Maybe they thought nobody would notice. Or maybe they don't care.In general the animation is very low quality - sometimes during the fights we can see some actual, nicely done moves, but other than that it's mostly static shots, moving mouths, some jagged running, little gesticulation... you get my point. This also hurts characters emotions, as they mostly look like they are half-surprised, half-curious all the time with half-opened mouths.But that's not the worst of it. The absolute, most horrid aspect of Sailor Moon Crystal is the direction. Jesus. It's so bad. Sometimes you don't even know what's going on due to the confusing and cheap camera angles. Even the important scenes, and I mean really important scenes are done so poorly it's sad. Nothing about the camera angles and montage to highlight them. Nothing.There are so many mouth shots - and for what? It's not like they show any amazing expressions. No, they just don't really have to be animated so they chose them over anything else. Hell, sometimes I'm not even 100% sure where the characters are standing because I only saw shots of faces, hair an mouths. Oh so many mouths.It's really sad - both for dedicated Sailor Moon fans from the 90' and the new viewers. This could have been something good. I don't know what happened. Is it really the budget? If so, why was it so low for a series so highly-anticipated? Is it because it's distributed online? Does Toei think that if they release a show for free it can basically be crap?

I watched the whole series and it seems to be a good way of seeing off the past and start making plans for the future. That's one sentence for the story that I liked most.I hope others watch this, and I don't mind if others would have a lot of comments no matter what side. The anime can have its own great moments and its flaws.Anyway, let's get to the story itself. First off, it's outstanding. The originality of...the timeline is always there and should remain there as usual. Since there's a small interference from another dimension in the anime series, it turns out as a good timing, I guess. The main characters definitely had an adventure.The art is not so much appealing, but it's still catchy no matter what angle you look at it. The thing I thought was good with the characters were their eyes over the rest of their bodies and it seemed to catch the attention of the rest of the Crystal fans. And it caught my attention, although there's not much to it, though.The sound is modern and it used good theme songs my way too. I can't say anything else and they've nailed it. Nice.The character edition was interesting. Seeing the main characters joined by completely new ones on this series makes a new excitement. So... for this kind of anime series, there are two sets of stories. That's why I made sure the story was indeed outstanding in my rate, but characters seemed to be only a few, though.The enjoyment in my case was based on the story and the sounds of the anime itself, but what I look at more are the physics in the anime combined with fantasy. THAT is new. Although there's a comparison to what science and magic does to a person (which I think was illogical at first), I think it paid off. Because I actually saw in the series that science and magic in my case was made possible. That's something to kick off the whole series and brings smiles to me.And for the overall, I must treat this anime as one of the most memorable animes I have watched. Why? Although the story and enjoyment seemed to be there the most, let's not forget the minor factors, which can bring both positive and negative reviews. Although it may bring some negative vibes to others... my variety can kick off as to how I look at it, included with its content.If the animators read this, keep it up. For the fans, make fiction, read manga... don't care. In my personal opinion it deserves a sequel.ロングライブオタク. (Long Live Otaku) :) the timeline is always there and should remain there as usual. Since there's a small interference from another dimension in the anime series, it turns out as a good timing, I guess. The main characters definitely had an adventure.The art is not so much appealing, but it's still catchy no matter what angle you look at it. The thing I thought was good with the characters were their eyes over the rest of their bodies and it seemed to catch the attention of the rest of the Crystal fans. And it caught my attention, although there's not much to it, though.The sound is modern and it used good theme songs my way too. I can't say anything else and they've nailed it. Nice.The character edition was interesting. Seeing the main characters joined by completely new ones on this series makes a new excitement.

I've seen all of the original anime in both Japanese and English, read all of the manga, seen the live action musicals and live action TV show, and I have all of the Sailor V manga.  I know there's a lot of cynicism towards Sailor Moon Crystal, but I honestly think it's actually very good and probably my favorite adaptation of the manga.  I had always anted an accurate adaptation of the manga as that was always my favorite...version of the story and Crystal succeeds in giving us the most faithful adaptation yet.   It follows the manga almost scene for scene and word for word, with the only real changes being some additions like making the relationship between the Sailor Soldiers and the Four Kings canon.  This was something only hinted at in the manga and explored in some of the musicals but it had never been made official in a TV adaptation before, not even in the live action version they made for the 10th anniversary, so I was really excited they made it canon for Crystal.Other additions I loved were how they gave us more details about Makoto's past and what happened to her and her sempai and actually showing us what Ami's father looks like.   I love that Crystal is more faster paced and that the characters and relationships are much more faithful to Naoko Takeuchi's vision.  Rei is her more serious and elegant feminist warrior as opposed to her more Betty and Veronica type personality she had in the original anime.  Minako is more of a hardened leader with a serious mission rather than her stereotypical bubbly dumb blonde stereotype in the original anime.   Mamoru is also not a total jerk to Usagi and actually respects and supports her and Chibiusa is much more sympathetic and not as bratty.   The music in Crystal is beautiful from start to finish.  The opening theme, Moon Pride, perfectly captures the feminist message of Sailor Moon and I love how the ending theme portrays the tragic fate of the Moon Princess.    The background music is also very catchy and has this grandiose epic feeling I love.Probably the most controversial aspect of Crystal is the animation quality.   There are unfortunately some episodes where the the animation budget does suffer some, with characters going off model and some episodes where there are some obvious animation errors.  Having said that, I do think some critics are over-exaggerating the animation issues and for all the problems it had, there were plenty of beautiful moments in the show too.  Most notably there's the episode where Makoto is introduced, the episode where Ami confronts Berthier, and and episode 21 were probably the most beautifully animated episodes and I feel like the animation quality in general improves a lot in the Black Moon arc.  The ending to the Black Moon arc was very emotionally powerful and moving and overall I feel like the positives of Crystal far outweigh the negatives.  Besides, most of the animation errors are being fixed on the Blu Ray releases and the original anime had far worse animation errors and inconsistent art styles but it seems to get far more praise than Crystal does even though it has all the same problem.s.   If you're a big fan of the manga and always wanted an accurate adaptation of it, I say give Crystal a chance but I can see how fans who prefer a looser adaptation like the original anime might be disappointed.  Still I really enjoy Crystal and I can't wait until the Infinity arc is adapted as that is my favorite arc of Sailor Moon and I'm so glad we're getting more of it made. version of the story and Crystal succeeds in giving us the most faithful adaptation yet.

Stars in the manga is my favourite season.The art is very beautiful, the character are not bland like some others say, it's just that the original story focus is Usagi and Mamoru. But it gets better when the next season mugen arc comes and later on....I love to see the new technology the senshi use like laptops and new devices.

I give this series a 10"", 'Some spoilers As a child I watched sailor moon on toonami with my other string of shows and it was a childhood favorite so I was really looking forward to this remake but Man this anime was a bumpy ride. I watched the original Sailor Moon series over as I was watching the 1st half of crystal and was comparing them. I had to step back and think of them as 2 separate works so I didn\'t let my nostalgia ruin what could possibly be a good series.After I stopped comparing them and just look at this as a stand alone I still had one...conclusion that didn\'t change. Outside of Sailor Moon Tuxedo Mask and Chibi-Usa the remaining characters were extremely bland, and the ""friendships"" weren\'t well developed at all. You tell me all this sacrificing for one another and that random bs pairing between the 4 original bad guys and the sailor senshi ever make sense? Outside of their introduction episodes what other moments did you see these relationships growing. Last I checked for people to become great friends it has to grow and I\'m sorry random fights here and there over a course of a few weeks and some memories of your past self isn\'t a good way to explain the development.Now on to Usagi and Mamo. Had its moments when it felt a little rushed but in the amount of time they had to work with I felt it was the highlight of the show. Love at 1st sight is a real thing many people just don\'t want to see it that way. The progression of how their feelings grew more and more and the interactions after each battle made the connection clear and smooth. Sailor Moon has always been some what of an annoying character with how useless she can be when it comes to mamoru but that\'s a realistic love struck teen. (Speaking from my own experience) Young love makes you kind of stupid any adult understands that.Finally Chibi, she\'s a bratty little girl who feels like no one understands her and meets her parents in their childhood days. She went through a traumatic experience and is very closed off to people but you see how she opens up to Usagai and Mamoru. Her opening up to mamo quickly makes sense just from the daddy daughter perspective. I personally didn\'t like the chibi and Usagi relationship developed just cause it didn\'t seem smooth more random and abrupt.Now the art I\'ll say this much hated watching the transformation scenes and besides the last episode the art overall wasn\'t impressive it was average and that might be generous.The actual story itself was good the sub plots they kept throwing in kinda messed it up though. Like I said in the stuff about the characters the lack of deveoplemnet and growth killed the possibility of having good sub plots in this remake.All in all I enjoyed it just cause it\'s sailor moon and I can\'t help but be caught up in my feelings from the past. Hoping if the continue this they invest more time into the other sailor senshi too but for this 6/10 conclusion that didn\'t change.

I honestly tried - and that\'s how I managed to get through 16 episodes of this show. The problem however... is that there was nothing to encourage me to continue forward.The bottom line with me is that I focus primarily on characters and story line when dealing with fiction. Good characters will not excuse a poor story line, and a good story or plot will not excuse weak characters. Crystal had both poor characters and a fairly weak story line.The thing about the original Sailormoon anime is that the characters were solid enough that they could decently affect how the story was presented....This made what could have been forgettable a lot more interesting in nature. But then again ... that brings up the biggest flaw with Crystal (besides animation... like honestly guys).It\'s like nobody cared enough about anything related to it - there is no consistency in terms of animation, in terms of quality, in terms of music, in terms of character and plot - nothing seemed to matter to the showrunners. And it shows... and that more than nostalgia is what has given Crystal it\'s Hatedom.Honestly, at it\'s best Crystal is average to okay - and that\'s damning by faint praise. At it\'s worst Crystal is more a homage to soulless cash grabs than to ""a warrior winning love by daylight"". If you want a sweet klutz watch the old series or check out Steven Universe instead.

It is a classic and very dear to my heart. However, I do not understand why everyone is complaining about this one. The three biggest complaints I keep hearing are 1. The animation 2. The characters 3. The story.*Side Note: I haven't read the manga so this is strictly comparing the old anime to the new.1. I find the animation very visually appealing. Sure it may look like a video game during the transformation sequences, but I do not think it's because the animators...were lazy or cheap. I think they liked the way the style looked. And looking past the transformations, everything is beautiful.2. These Sailor Scouts got plenty character development in Crystal. I think some people feel closer to the old versions of the Sailor Scouts because they grew up watching the old Sailor Moon so they feel more attached to them. Also the old Sailor Moon tended to drag out the introductions of each scout. I remember complaining when I first watched it about how it was just Moon, Mercury, and Mars for the longest time. Whereas, in Crystal the hop to the character introductions. Everyone still gets their spotlight moment, but it doesn't drag out.3. There's more story in Crystal than there was in the original. Like I said in my review for the original, it follows the same kind or episode guideline as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. The big villains send their minions to go fight the 5 heroes, heroes doubt their ability to beat the bad guys, heroes have to use their big special power to defeat the minions, big villain vows to destroy them next time, and every now and then there's a climax where the big villain is defeated and a new one is introduced in the next episode. Incredibly predictable, but still enjoyable. Whereas, in Crystal there is actually a big underlying plot. The story may contain the same elements, but it flows more smoothly and it does not just pass carelessly from villain to villain.To sum up: I love both the original and Crystal, but I do think Crystal is overall a better anime. were lazy or cheap.

I tried a couple of episodes right after they came out, and I was like... ugh? What's that supposed to be? Why is Usagi so irritating? What's with these terrible transformations? So I gave up.Recently, I've been thinking about it and decided to give it a second chance. I got rid of the attitude of comparing it to the old version and focused more on the first and most classic version of the story - manga. And that's what you need to truly enjoy it! That's...why Usagi is different - she is the way she was supposed to be to begin with! And apart of obvious disadvantage of CGI transformations, everything about Crystal is the way it was in manga. Personalities of Senshi are much more prominent, they are more than just Usagi's subordinates. I love the way Minako is portrayed - as the first awaken one, the original leader of Senshi with the personality of a true guardian and not only attention seeking/popularity obsessed girl. The feelings are real, so much deeper than in 90's.But the biggest + is the story. No fillers! No 500 monsters sent by each bad guy before he shows up.  Overall - if you are a fan of original manga - you will love it.

A huge fan of the series, I heard nothing but awful reviews from friends, YouTube critics, and fellow MAL reviewers. I expected SMC to be a mediocre to poor series. I was, however, surprised.Story: 8SMC contrasts with the 1990s anime series as it attempts to more closely the original manga series. The story is therefore more of a translation than an adaptation. As a translation, SMC feels like much closer to its source material than the original anime series. Unnecessary filler and ""villain of the week""...characters are removed and instead gets into the meat of the series efficiently.Art: 7Admittedly, it took time for me to get used to the new art style, especially the full CGI transformations. The transformations are pretty awful, taking up a lot of time each episode, and the CG characters look as lifeless as the plastic models of the Sailor Senshi I have sitting on my bookshelf. However, the regular animation on a whole is pretty decent, and after a few episodes, appreciated the crisper look that the ""pretty guardians"" hadSound: 7Like the art, it took a while to get into the new sound. A sucker for the original OP, I hated ""Moon Pride"" and its fully CG characters for the first 20 episodes, until I warmed up to it.  I still, however, prefer the original English theme. It also took time to get used to the new voices. Usagi\'s voice for me will always be Tracey Moore and Terri Hawkes. The new voices are fine, but where SMC shines is the OST. The choral music played during the transformations and epic moments is simply beautiful, and enhances the story and enjoyment.Character: 8The characters are familiar to longtime fans of both the manga and older anime. True, because a lot of filler is trimmed we see less of each Senshi and the focus is clearly on Usagi, Mamoru, and Chubiusa, but Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter are clearly defined and have their moments of greatness. SMC also made me feel much more for Sailor Pluto than I ever had before, who as a lesser character is an achievement in my book.Enjoyment: 10I enjoyed every moment of Crystal, beginning to end. The original will always have a place in my heart, but as a 21st century update, I enjoyed SMC much more than I thought I would. I\'m definitely looking forward to Season III when it\'s finished dubbingOverall: 8SMC isn\'t perfect, but it isn\'t the awful anime many reviews seem to think it is either.

And it was the same character,and person,so how is that even possible?this sailor moon kicked butt!The only thing I didnt like about this anime,was...that the animation was...disturbing and a little creepy to look at,man at least the original sailor moon didnt make me feel like losing my lunch!I personally really enjoy this one.and I think all fan's of the original should at least check it out. that the animation was...disturbing and a little creepy to look at,man at least the original sailor moon didnt make me feel like losing my lunch!I personally really enjoy this one.and I think all fan's of the original should at least check it out."", ""Sailor Moon has won fans all over the world, and everybody loved both the anime and the manga. Love for this eponymous magical girl series festered on decades after its inception. When a reboot of the original anime was announced, fans were excited. Two years later, we finally got Sailor Moon Crystal...unfortunately, nowadays, Crystal is seen as spoiled goods, a blemish on what made Sailor Moon great, and nowadays, people hail the 90s anime as being the better adaptation despite it having just as many problems, if not more. Despite it being a straight adaptation of the manga, people have lambasted it left and right,...fans and haters alike, for a variety of problems: bad animation, static characters, brisk pacing, no filler in order to give the characters screentime, etc. Despite the show still having just as many fans, you can't go anywhere without seeing hate for Sailor Moon Crystal, with some saying its the absolute worst anime ever.Now, it's okay to not like something. As long as one expresses their dislike of something in a rational manner that doesn't hurt others, that's okay. However, on places like Tumblr, the hatred for SMC has grown to downright ridiculous levels, and people are hating it for less than rational reasons. I've heard people accuse it of being ableist, harming queer women (HOW?!), promoting anorexia, endorsing selfish behavior, rape culture, gay erasure, misogyny, etc. Worse than that, they even use their hatred to attack other people who happen to like it for what it is and don't mind its many problems! Good lord! It's one thing to not like a show, but its another thing to bump said hatred to irrational levels and attack people for even so much as acknowledging its existence. I don't like ecchi shows or porn, and you don't see me attacking other people for liking them! Heck, my friend Paul LOVES Ranma 1/2 and I don't, but we respect each other's preferences and are still friends! My friend Sami LOVES Levi from Attack on Titan and I don't, but do you see me attacking her and calling her names and making up lies about her for loving him? NO!After seeing all the completely weird hatred being bombarded on SMC, I decided to watch it again. I tried to watch it when it came out, but had to drop it due to other obligations. Honestly, I don't hate it, but I don't necessarily like it either. Rather...I kinda pity it. It knows what it wants to be, and I would much rather watch SMC than most other anime that have been saturating the industry at the moment, especially the stupid ecchi/harem anime that have been diluting the industry for the past few years. It has a lot of potential, and while it's definitely not a masterpiece considering how many problems it has, there's still a lot to like about it. I'm pretty sure a lot of modern kids today would love seeing a show like SMC.The story's about the same as the manga. A lazy, clumsy girl named Usagi Tsukino just wants to be normal. She doesn't do well in school, she prefers to hang out with her friends or go to the arcade to hang out with one of the cute employees, and she wants to eat, read manga, and laze around, like most girls her age would. One day, a cat named Luna appears before her, giving her a magical brooch that turns her into a warrior named Sailor Moon, who has to fight the evil Dark Kingdom, who intends to steal something called the Legendary Silver Crystal and use it to destroy the world. Joining her are Sailors Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, and while she is reluctant at first, she decides to fight the Dark Kingdom and save the world, knowing all of life is at stake.I'm kind of torn on the animation. On one hand, I won't deny that Toei's lack of budget really shows throughout the show. Some body parts like eyes and mouths are out of place, the girls are designed in ways that make them look like plastic barbie dolls with unrealistic anatomy, and the CGI is definitely very cringeworthy. I've seen far worse CGI so I'm personally not bothered by it, but the transformation sequences do make the girls look like plastic barbie dolls that don't have much life to them. On the other hand, the artwork is for the most part very faithful to the manga. The character designs are sleek and the hair movement can be downright beautiful when it wants to be, the senshis attacks are a lot better animated (I really like how Sailor Mars' Burning Mandala looks. I think it looks better here), and the costume designs are luscious. The whole show, especially when the girls go to Crystal Tokyo, has this mystical, ethereal quality about it that I think was present in the manga as well. I think Crystal managed to capture it perfectly. Plus, I love the detail the animators put into things in the background, like how Usagi's bedroom looks or Mamoru's bedrooms. The decor says a lot about their overall characters.When I heard that Yasuharu Takanashi was composing the music for this series, I was convinced to watch SMC. He's one of my favorite modern day composers, and worked on a lot of anime I like, such as Pretty Cure, Konnichiwa Anne, etc. No surprise here, as the soundtrack is very good and solid. The 90s soundtrack was very dated, so hearing more fitting music for the series really made SMC work musically. The opening theme is okay, rather J-poppy and not nearly as iconic as Moonlight Densetsu is. But it's not bad. Hearing the same theme song for over 100 episodes can be boring, so Moon Pride was refreshing. The ending theme is the best though.I won't lie, the characters and characterization is where Crystal really suffers. The manga was no different, but it really stands out here. Usagi does mature throughout the show, which is fine, but as much as I like the other characters, the other senshi seem to come off as props to make Usagi look good. Their lack of characterization really detriments the show, especially since the arcs are being adapted into 12-14 episodes, leaving little room for fleshing them out and showing the girls' lives when they're not fighting evil. I will say this though: Mamoru actually has a personality in this version! He doesn't come off as annoyingly prickish like he does in the 90s anime, though I still think his live-action version is the best. The villains also suffer in the characterization department, as they're just reduced to their being evil for the sake of being evil, or random mooks who get killed after one episode. The 90s anime definitely did better in fleshing out the villains and making them come off as more than just petty villains. Really, the only character who even has a good character arc is Chibiusa, and trust me, she is NOWHERE NEAR as bratty as she was in the 90s anime, so rest assured, she's MUCH more tolerable here. Usagi and Chibiusa are okay characterization-wise, but the rest of them are woefully underdeveloped, making any emotional moments lack any meaningful impact.Honestly, I think SMC's problems with storytelling and characterization would be rectified had the creators been given the chance to make each arc 24-26 episodes long rather than 12-14. If they did that, it would allow for some filler to fill up space between the important parts and give the girls a chance to develop and show what they're like outside of saving the world. The live-action version is beloved because it made optimal use of its long episode count, focused only on one arc, and gave the girls episodes that just allowed them to develop, flesh themselves out, and show what they're like when they're not saving the world. Because all the arcs are 12-14 episodes, everything is extremely compressed, not allowing for much breathing room. I think this is SMC's greatest flaw: the short length of each arc. The story SMC wants to tell is grand, epic, and compelling, and it knows what it wants to be. It's ambitious, but because of time constraints, the show is unable to realize its full potential and tell the story it wants to, characterization included.Even so, I don't hate SMC. I don't LOVE it, as SM's live-action adaptation will always be my favorite. But I do like SMC a lot more than I do the 90s anime, and if you gave me a choice to either watch this or some stupid ecchi anime like Ro-Kyu-Bu, Nakaimo, or Kanokon, or basically every incest anime ever (I'm looking at you, Kiss x Sis!!!), I'd take SMC any day. It's not a perfect show. Let's face it, no media art form will EVER be perfect, and we shouldn't expect SMC to be either. At the same time, I really don't think SMC deserves all the bile that it gets. I don't watch anime in order to look for representation or accuse it of endorsing bad things or any of that stuff. I watch anime because it gives me what most American cartoons nowadays don't: substance. Serious, compelling storylines. Characters who we can care about who don't do nothing but talk about make-up or boys or are super hot and sexy. That's why I loved shows like Pokemon, Digimon, and Yu-Gi-Oh as a kid, because they were bold, daring, serious, didn't try to hide unpleasant things like death or family problems from us, and didn't talk down to their audience. SMC is the same. It takes its audience seriously and wants to be something that can appeal to all ages in spite of its problems. I think, had SMC come out when I was a kid, I probably would have loved it.Sailor Moon Crystal isn't the best adaptation of the manga, but if you manage to look past its flaws and appreciate it for its merits, it's still a serviceable show that I think will really appeal to kids. Come on, let's be honest. It could have been a heck of a lot worse. At least it's not Breadwinners or The Nutshack or even every ecchi anime ever! fans and haters alike, for a variety of problems: bad animation, static characters, brisk pacing, no filler in order to give the characters screentime, etc. Despite the show still having just as many fans, you can't go anywhere without seeing hate for Sailor Moon Crystal, with some saying its the absolute worst anime ever.Now, it's okay to not like something. As long as one expresses their dislike of something in a rational manner that doesn't hurt others, that's okay. However, on places like Tumblr, the hatred for SMC has grown to downright ridiculous levels, and people are hating it for less than rational reasons. I've heard people accuse it of being ableist, harming queer women (HOW?!), promoting anorexia, endorsing selfish behavior, rape culture, gay erasure, misogyny, etc. Worse than that, they even use their hatred to attack other people who happen to like it for what it is and don't mind its many problems! Good lord! It's one thing to not like a show, but its another thing to bump said hatred to irrational levels and attack people for even so much as acknowledging its existence. I don't like ecchi shows or porn, and you don't see me attacking other people for liking them! Heck, my friend Paul LOVES Ranma 1/2 and I don't, but we respect each other's preferences and are still friends! My friend Sami LOVES Levi from Attack on Titan and I don't, but do you see me attacking her and calling her names and making up lies about her for loving him? NO!After seeing all the completely weird hatred being bombarded on SMC, I decided to watch it again. I tried to watch it when it came out, but had to drop it due to other obligations. Honestly, I don't hate it, but I don't necessarily like it either. Rather...I kinda pity it. It knows what it wants to be, and I would much rather watch SMC than most other anime that have been saturating the industry at the moment, especially the stupid ecchi/harem anime that have been diluting the industry for the past few years. It has a lot of potential, and while it's definitely not a masterpiece considering how many problems it has, there's still a lot to like about it. I'm pretty sure a lot of modern kids today would love seeing a show like SMC.The story's about the same as the manga. A lazy, clumsy girl named Usagi Tsukino just wants to be normal. She doesn't do well in school, she prefers to hang out with her friends or go to the arcade to hang out with one of the cute employees, and she wants to eat, read manga, and laze around, like most girls her age would. One day, a cat named Luna appears before her, giving her a magical brooch that turns her into a warrior named Sailor Moon, who has to fight the evil Dark Kingdom, who intends to steal something called the Legendary Silver Crystal and use it to destroy the world. Joining her are Sailors Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, and while she is reluctant at first, she decides to fight the Dark Kingdom and save the world, knowing all of life is at stake.I'm kind of torn on the animation. On one hand, I won't deny that Toei's lack of budget really shows throughout the show.

Come on, let's be honest. It could have been a heck of a lot worse. At least it's not Breadwinners or The Nutshack or even every ecchi anime ever!"", 'I\'m just gonna say it right now. I hate Sailor Moon Crystal and don\'t get me started on just simply saying, ""Well, probably because you\'ve only seen the original anime and didn\'t read the manga."" Let me make one thing perfectly clear. I have ZERO interest in the manga. In fact, I barely; even read any manga\'s, except Monster Musume since that\'s a slice of life manga and I\'m very well enjoying it. In fact, I just pre-ordered the next volume that came out this week but we\'re not here to talk about that. My point is, is that I have no interest in the...manga because most manga\'s that have anime adaptations are not that very good. Sailor Moon is probably the worst given how these first two seasons went and yes. I have seen the original anime because I was a big fan of it. It is overall; one of my top ten favorite anime\'s of all time and I am both; honest and fair. When I heard that they were doing a reboot on Sailor Moon for the 20th anniversary, (even though it took two years for them to finally; get it out the door), I was excited as to see what we would get for its anniversary, but sadly; we got one of the lowest forms of crap of an insult to one of the most popular, and memorable anime\'s of all time. Wouldn\'t it had been better to get a team together who really cared for the series and go beyond Stars as to see what the scouts were up to after their high school days and everything else? I mean, that would have been even better for the anniversary even if there wasn\'t a manga for that, but oh no. We had to get a lazy, half-assed, cash in just so someone could make a quick buck. Also, I should point out that most of my hatred for this reboot comes from the Black Moon Arc which is my most favorite arc in the franchise and I\'ll explain why when we get to that part. This review and more or less, rant is long overdue in my book. I\'ve been wanting to get this out for a long time now but at that time just didn\'t have the stamina to do so since this so called; reboot took a lot out of me. I had to literally; force myself through every episode to finish this and yes. I am aware that the Infinity Arc or Death Busters, the third season of Sailor Moon is coming to Crystal sometime this year and right now. I\'m not looking forward to it, but enough of my rambling. Let\'s get into this already.Story: 3/10The story in both arc\'s are dreadful, especially; in Black Moon, but let\'s start with Dark Kingdom. Now, to its credit it does flow very well at least unlike Black Moon. The Dark Kingdom Arc is where everything began and introduces us to Queen Baryl and here generals. Jadeite, Nephrite, Zoisite, and Kunzite, as well as the intro to Queen Metaria. Their plans are to find the Imperium Silver Crystal, a.k.a. the Heart of the Moon so that they can take over the world and the universe. (Of course)! It also introduces our main characters Usagi as Sailor Moon, Mamoru as Tuxedo Mask, Ami as Sailor Mercury, Rei as Sailor Mars, Makoto as Sailor Jupiter, and Minako as Sailor Venus and that they are the reincarnated sailor scouts from the Millienium Age before it was destroyed.The story well it does have a good flow to it has some serious problems. For one thing, it is rushed. There are only 13 episodes per season. Just simply trying to cram everything in together at once and that is not a good thing and I don\'t care what anybody says by simply saying, ""but the 13 episodes follow\'s the story exactly from the manga."" That doesn\'t mean that, that makes for a good anime guys. It might be good for a manga or comic book but not for an anime. The purpose of adapting a manga into an anime is to give it something more. Like more character development, developing the plot more, expanding the story, and giving the villians a more and better approach. Simply cramming everything together just to get it done and over with is right away the mark of a bad anime. It\'s the same philosophy for a video game, especially; a movie video game that throws everything at you at once in the kitchen sink at the end shares the same principle.However; though, I will say that Dark Kingdom did have some good ideas in it that actually did come from the manga but were poorly executed. They either lasted for about just that one episode and got struck down right away. It was because of most of these ideas why we needed to have these seasons expanded, especially; for newer audiences that were coming into this show, but again, didn\'t give a damn. In fact, I\'ll just simply call it as it presented itself, lazy. Pure laziness. Despite these poorly; executed ideas though, the story did flow well in Dark Kingdom.However; the king of the turd lay with the story in Black Moon. By the nine, the story in Black Moon is bad. It\'s pure lazy, repetitive, tedious, and just plain boring and the major problem with it of all is that the ending fights with the main villians in this one are anti-climatic. Black Moon is my favorite arc in this show because in my personal opinion there was a lot more at stake here and this is the season that I literally; had to force myself through every episode because it was that bad. Every time when one of the new villians, except Rubias, came in for a battle with the scouts got axed right away. The story also made no sense in this reboot. Why was the final battle in the future and not the past like it was in the original and why did the scouts spend so much time in the future in this one? Ugh! Another problem with this series, actually; for both; is that there is no drama. Ok, the drama was built up well for Pluto but that was it. Beyond or before that, there\'s absolutely no drama, and furthermore; not only is it filled with plot holes but also in my opinion. It has one of the biggest plot holes at the beginning that I\'ve ever seen. I won\'t mention it on here because that would be a spoiler.Art: 4/10Much like the story for Dark Kingdom the art work is overall; not that bad either. At least, again, for the first season. They decided to go back to a water color paint style for the backgrounds which I really like. I\'ve always found water color paint to by one of the best styles to be used in anime\'s like these because it really brings out the texture for Japanese life styles and housing and was very well done. The animation while having some major problems in it was at the very least ok to get through the first season. Even the transformation scenes didn\'t look that bad at first. The transformation flowed pretty well and even the element attacks looked pretty good, but again, ONLY, for one season.For the second season they didn\'t even try to improve on anything. The animation was perfectly the same. It still had the same flaws that were presented in the first season and just simply gave the middle finger to fans that actually; gave a damn about the animation. Again, lazy! Hell, they actually; had to correct the color in the opening sequence because of you know, laziness. I have never seen such poorly developed animation for a reboot from a classic like Sailor Moon in my entire life. There\'s no life to it, no energy, and barely any effort put into it for the second season. Ugh!Sound: 5/10Once again, we have lazy editorial for this crap for not giving a damn since once again. We have the same repetitive and tedious sounds and music for both seasons. However; with that said, the sound and music is actually; pretty good, especially; the opening and ending themes. I freaking love these two songs. Moon Pride for the opening and Heart Moving for the ending. Heart Moving in my opinion is one of the most beautiful ending themes that I have ever heard in anime. It\'s heartwarming, it\'s romantic, and kind of tragic when you think about it. Moon Pride is a great way to open up the show because it\'s energetic, it\'s loud, and kind of has a rock theme to it. The background music is pretty good too but once again nothing changes for the second season and I\'m gonna leave it at that.Characters\': 2/10Where do I even begin with this segment? For me personally; this is what KILLED, Sailor Moon Crystal for me and the reason why is because all the characters except Sailor Moon and Endymion are basically; stripped of their personalities. It was their personalities that made a lot of people fall in love with this show to begin with. Amy was the brains of the group and always analyzing the situation and how to get out of tough situations. Rei was the psychic and used those powers in order to either; help out those whom were possessed and could actually sense when something was wrong and evil was nearby. Lita or Makoto was the warrior of the group, (as well as my favorite character until Saturn came out), and could fight outside of her Jupiter form. Minako was the beauty of the group and was the first to become a sailor scout before the others. Actually; in retrospect, she\'s probably the only scout in this series that has somewhat of a personality while the others don\'t and it doesn\'t stop there.Hell, even Mini Moon or Chibi I think is her actual name feels somewhat stripped of her personality. Yes, she does act sad and does feel distress but I didn\'t feel the exact impact of her feeling guilty when she took the crystal like we did in the original and hell. When she became Wicked or Black Lady. She was somewhat a little bit diabolical even though she was brainwashed but you actually felt that she was now kind of evil.It gets better though. Even the villians feel like they don\'t have a personality, especially; the main villians like Baryl and of course, Wiseman. Wiseman was this big manipulative, diabolical, entity who could easily twist and turn someone with just simply his words but they feel empty here. Even his voice doesn\'t help. His voice in the original was big and loud and helped give him a personality and he barely does anything in this series. Hell, not only do nearly all the villians feel like they have no personality but also feel like that they are doing absolutely; NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Their just damn dissapointing and underplayed, just like the main characters.Futhermore; it doesn\'t help either that the scouts don\'t really fight off the villians together most of the time. It feels like Sailor Moon is the one doing all the work hence why she\'s probably the only scout that actually has a personality. Ugh!Enjoyment: 2/10I\'m gonna keep this one simple and short. Did I enjoy this reboot? Hell no, but to its credit, (what little it deserves). At least for the first season there were some good ideas but again, poorly executed and there was nothing for the second season. It was mainly flawed, repetitive, tedious, boring, and the fact that nearly every character was stripped of their personality didn\'t help much either. Again, pure laziness!Overall: 3/10My overall score for both seasons of this rebooted anime of Sailor Moon Crystal is a 3/10. It would be a 1 or 2/10 if not for some of the effort that actually showed in the Dark Kingdom reboot. I would strongly recommend that if you\'re just coming into Sailor Moon to NOT watch these two series as a starting point. Go and watch something else because there are better stuff out there. Hell, go and watch the 90\'s original anime. It is a classic and is the perfect intro if you\'re just coming into this franchise. If you liked this reboot, more power to you, but I didn\'t and I will not return to it again, but. I have heard that for the third arc, Infinity or Death Busters that they have a new director and art team for it. So, since I am fair I am going to give that series one chance but one chance only, but mark my words. If they screw up the intro to my favorite scout in this one. There will be hell to pay. manga because most manga\'s that have anime adaptations are not that very good. Sailor Moon is probably the worst given how these first two seasons went and yes. I have seen the original anime because I was a big fan of it. It is overall; one of my top ten favorite anime\'s of all time and I am both; honest and fair.

I have never seen such poorly developed animation for a reboot from a classic like Sailor Moon in my entire life. There\'s no life to it, no energy, and barely any effort put into it for the second season. Ugh!Sound: 5/10Once again, we have lazy editorial for this crap for not giving a damn since once again. We have the same repetitive and tedious sounds and music for both seasons. However; with that said, the sound and music is actually; pretty good, especially; the opening and ending themes. I freaking love these two songs. Moon Pride for the opening and Heart Moving for the ending. Heart Moving in my opinion is one of the most beautiful ending themes that I have ever heard in anime. It\'s heartwarming, it\'s romantic, and kind of tragic when you think about it. Moon Pride is a great way to open up the show because it\'s energetic, it\'s loud, and kind of has a rock theme to it. The background music is pretty good too but once again nothing changes for the second season and I\'m gonna leave it at that.Characters\': 2/10Where do I even begin with this segment? For me personally; this is what KILLED, Sailor Moon Crystal for me and the reason why is because all the characters except Sailor Moon and Endymion are basically; stripped of their personalities. It was their personalities that made a lot of people fall in love with this show to begin with. Amy was the brains of the group and always analyzing the situation and how to get out of tough situations. Rei was the psychic and used those powers in order to either; help out those whom were possessed and could actually sense when something was wrong and evil was nearby. Lita or Makoto was the warrior of the group, (as well as my favorite character until Saturn came out), and could fight outside of her Jupiter form. Minako was the beauty of the group and was the first to become a sailor scout before the others. Actually; in retrospect, she\'s probably the only scout in this series that has somewhat of a personality while the others don\'t and it doesn\'t stop there.Hell, even Mini Moon or Chibi I think is her actual name feels somewhat stripped of her personality. Yes, she does act sad and does feel distress but I didn\'t feel the exact impact of her feeling guilty when she took the crystal like we did in the original and hell. When she became Wicked or Black Lady. She was somewhat a little bit diabolical even though she was brainwashed but you actually felt that she was now kind of evil.It gets better though. Even the villians feel like they don\'t have a personality, especially; the main villians like Baryl and of course, Wiseman. Wiseman was this big manipulative, diabolical, entity who could easily twist and turn someone with just simply his words but they feel empty here. Even his voice doesn\'t help. His voice in the original was big and loud and helped give him a personality and he barely does anything in this series. Hell, not only do nearly all the villians feel like they have no personality but also feel like that they are doing absolutely; NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Their just damn dissapointing and underplayed, just like the main characters.Futhermore; it doesn\'t help either that the scouts don\'t really fight off the villians together most of the time. It feels like Sailor Moon is the one doing all the work hence why she\'s probably the only scout that actually has a personality. Ugh!Enjoyment: 2/10I\'m gonna keep this one simple and short. Did I enjoy this reboot? Hell no, but to its credit, (what little it deserves). At least for the first season there were some good ideas but again, poorly executed and there was nothing for the second season. It was mainly flawed, repetitive, tedious, boring, and the fact that nearly every character was stripped of their personality didn\'t help much either. Again, pure laziness!Overall: 3/10My overall score for both seasons of this rebooted anime of Sailor Moon Crystal is a 3/10. It would be a 1 or 2/10 if not for some of the effort that actually showed in the Dark Kingdom reboot. I would strongly recommend that if you\'re just coming into Sailor Moon to NOT watch these two series as a starting point. Go and watch something else because there are better stuff out there. Hell, go and watch the 90\'s original anime. It is a classic and is the perfect intro if you\'re just coming into this franchise. If you liked this reboot, more power to you, but I didn\'t and I will not return to it again, but. I have heard that for the third arc, Infinity or Death Busters that they have a new director and art team for it. So, since I am fair I am going to give that series one chance but one chance only, but mark my words. If they screw up the intro to my favorite scout in this one. There will be hell to pay.', 'The video review is up, but here is the written review.A remake of well-beloved series with more homage to the plot than the original, but animation slows it down.Story - 6/10Usagi Tsukino is just your normal average clumsy, whiny and happy middle schooler girl. Who runs into a cat with crescent shaped moon on her forehead, named Luna. Now this cat magically turns Usagi into Sailor Moon to fight evil. At first Usagi is more shocked and disinterested in fighting, because she is whiny, however becomes use to it eventually. Sailor Moon’s mission is find the other Sailor Guardians, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Venus, assemble...them to find the Legendary Silver Crystal which has immense power, while also protecting the princess. That is what the first half is about, the second half focuses more on the future of Sailor Moon and the Guardians themselves. The story is simple, yet interesting considering the time it was made. However there a times in the anime where the plot just doesn’t make sense or is disturbing, for the type of show it is. However Sailor Moon is not only an adventure, it’s also a romance, there is a lot of romance involved between two of the main characters, where is feels very forced and unrealistic. I don’t mind it particular, but sometimes it just really gets in the way of the main plot and drags out.I never read the original source material, but from what I heard the story follows more closely to the manga. So that’s a good thing if you’re a Sailor Moon fan. However the plot is very repetitive, keep in my mind this was made in the 90s. What I mean by repetitive is the structure of the anime, like here’s a new sailor guardian, help her. Oh here’s a new villain, defeat them. The show gets really repetitive and it doesn’t help that the anime does take a while to develop, as the overall story really gets dragged a lot. And because of the repetitive nature of the show, the story can be predictable, with plot twists you can predict miles away.Characters - 7/10Usagi Tsukino, aka, Sailor Moon is the main protagonist. At first she is a clumsy and whiny little girl, who just wants to be a Sailor scout superhero because it sounded fun at the time, however she comes to realise it’s not all fun and games, and she really needs to start getting her act together in order to become the hero, that everyone around her is looking for. Now Usagi gets the most development in the whole series, as we see her going through some teen phases throughout the show. She starts off as a spoiled whiny brat, turns into the girl who just wants the guy, then the one who gets jealous and finally starts to realise her importance to everyone and matures. At the same time, Sailor Moon’s story is kind of a coming of age journey. One thing I don’t like about Sailor Moon, is her powers, which seems to make everyone else useless, as she seems to one shot everyone, when her comrades don’t.Luna is the cat who originally turns Usagi into Sailor Moon. She plays the role as the mentor and adviser to everyone, as she pretty much debriefs the Sailor scouts on what to do.As for the other Sailor scouts, there is, Ami Mizuno, Sailor Mercury, who is the brains of the group and uses water elemental based attacks, she is also the first Sailor Scout Usagi runs into. Rei Hino, Sailor Mars, is very serious person compared to the rest of the team, she is a Shrine maiden and possesses power to sense evil, while also fighting with the use of fire spells. Makoto Kino, Sailor Jupiter is physically the strongest in the group, due to her size, she uses electricity based powers. And finally, Minako Aino, Sailor Venus who is the last Sailor Scout to be introduced and officially serves as the leader of group, she knows what the whole situation is about and reveals it later on. She’s got the most experience as a Sailor Scout and is the most confident in her powers.My biggest gripes with the other Sailor guardians are that they only have around 1 to 2 episodes to shine. The episode they’re initially introduced in and sometime later down the track in the second half. Because after their initial appearance we rarely see any other development from them. And for some reason, despite being made Sailor Guardians later than Usagi, they have already discovered and know how to use their powers, yet they are not always the most effective at the same time, because Sailor Moon usually beats everyone with one shot later in the fight. And I really hate that, because it felt like the other Sailor Scouts were just used to extend the story and make it really repetitive.One of the other main characters is Mamoru Chiba, also known as Tuxedo Mask. Although they tried to hide his identity initially, it’s blatantly obvious who he is. His role in the anime is Sailor Moon’s primary love interest, and eye candy for the ladies. Considering everyone has powers of some sort, he doesn’t possess any until towards the end. He is just trying to do his job by finding the Crystals, same as the Sailor Gaurdians, but first we don’t know why. He gets some development as the series progress, starting off mysterious figure to a reliable lead character.Animation and Sound - 4/10, 6/10The animation for Sailor Moon Crystal, is decent at first, but then it gets to the point where it starts looking bad. Like everything was good for the first episode, but then there are animation mistakes afterwards. Such as some eyes and body not being in proportion. A completely wrong animation for the move that was being said. There’s no consistency in the animation and considering how the show was aired, every 3 weeks or so, you would expect decent animation, but that is not the case, I don’t know what they spent their extra weeks doing in the studio. The action scenes are a hit or miss, some of them look fine, but some don’t. My biggest gripe with the animation is the repetitiveness of the animation. Not kidding you, they can spend literally ¼ of an episode transforming. And it’s the same animation over and over, and you get sick and tired of it, it looks good the first couple of times, but after that, it gets boring. However I do think the 3D transformation is not bad, even I’m not a huge fan of 3D, but it looks obvious they put a lot of effort in the transformation.For the soundtrack of Sailor Moon Crystal, it has a very typical pop princess sort of soundtrack. During the light-hearted moments to the action scenes when the Sailor Guardians are winning, there’s usually a triumph pop track playing. And when it gets eerie and dark, the music caters towards that as well and gets dark with it with sometimes a choir  in it, which sounds good. The transformation music is probably the most recognizable in the show. It’s an upbeat track with a choir singing, and sounds good. The opening is track catchy and good, but not as fun as the original Sailor Moon Opening. The Ending is a much slower paced and caters towards the more romance side of the show.Enjoyment - 6/10Even though I used to love Sailor Moon back in the 90s, this reboot of the franchise doesn’t really do it any more justice. Sure it may pay more homage to the manga and that’s fine, but compared to today anime, is it as original. At point it is, and sometimes it’s not great, the story can becoming really exciting tense action and drama, then you get to the romance which feels completely forced and over exaggerated. The biggest thing that stopped my enjoyment in for this anime, which won’t affect you if, you were planning to watch it, is the airing of this anime. Sailor Moon Crystal, had a weird airing time, as it was aired every 3 weeks. So I had to wait 3 weeks to watch a new episode, plus a lengthy break somewhere in the middle. And by the time it got to the half-way point, I thought it was too much and hoping it would end. And seriously if you take 3 weeks to release an episode, I expect great animation, but that is not what I got, what were those extra weeks for. Like I said this won’t affect you if you haven’t seen it yet, and plan to, as all episodes are out now, and you can go watch it all in one sitting, if you want to. However I do enjoy just for the fact it’s Sailor Moon, and we get to see these characters again on screen. Even though the pacing is somewhat slow, I did enjoy some of the action and drama here and there.Verdict - 6/10For the story of Sailor Moon Crystal, I give it a 6, as the story is interesting and exciting in the first half, but gets confusing and somewhat disturbing in the second half. The plot gets repetitive, but makes enough progression to hook you onto the next episode.For the animation and sound I give it a 4 and 6. Because the animation is just sometimes bad, even though it’s an improvement from the original, it doesn’t hold to the same standard to today anime. Although the transformation and some of action is completely fine, it gets really repetitive and makes you wonder what the extra weeks were used for, if it wasn’t used to polish the animation. The soundtrack is good, but nothing really speaks epicenes in the soundtrack, it speaks typical for the genre.For the characters this gets a 7 from. The development of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask gets really deep and intense and interesting and its really great to see their chemistry improve over time. However the other Sailor Guardians are unfortunately left out to make room for more Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, and they don’t get their fair share of screen time.For my personal enjoyment, it’s a 6 from, keep in mind this would be a higher score if I watched normally aired, but the airing just made it frustrating to me waiting for a new episode, however since all episodes are out now, this shouldn’t affect you. Although I enjoy the story and some of characters, I felt the pacing of the show was kind of slow especially during the times when they would spend forever transforming. However it is Sailor Moon, so there is nostalgia in there.So for the overall score of Sailor Moon: Crystal, I give it a 6/10. If they polished the animation it would’ve been so much better, considering the story and characters are good enough to make it enjoyable. I recommend this anime to old Sailor Moon fans, if they’re looking for a nostalgia trip, or fans of the magical girl genre and romance genre. If you didn’t like Sailor Moon before, this won’t change your mind, although if you’re looking for the original story, go check it out if you want to. them to find the Legendary Silver Crystal which has immense power, while also protecting the princess. That is what the first half is about, the second half focuses more on the future of Sailor Moon and the Guardians themselves. The story is simple, yet interesting considering the time it was made.

But when it was actually started airing I was super excited and I couldn't wait till the next episode! Sadly they made us wait 2 or 3 weeks for the next episode which completely killed...it bc after the two weeks past it felt like it has been 20 or 30 years!

I should probably start off by saying i never watched the 90s version. The art is just too old for my taste. So i decided to watch crystal. And i have to say i do not regret that decision i really enjoyed it.story: 9. The story is the strong suit of sailor moon. It is unique and original. I've never seen anything like it.Art: 9. A lot of people didn't like the art and animation. I didn't mind it, personally. In fact I liked it. The art is really cute and I loved the way they did the...eyes.Sound: 8. The ops and eds where great!character: 7. Characters are where Sailor moon falls a little short. There aren't really any flaws in really any of them. Which does not make them bad, just not really relatable. I liked my characters to be flawed tbh. Sailor moon and chibiusa being the best. They are by far the most developed. This is where I've heard the 90s version getting it better. The sailor guardians are still fun tho. Tuxedo mask is a little mid if i must say. I always found myself wanting Sailor moon to put her friends before him and stop fawning over him. Which was a little irritating.Enjoyment: 9. I quite liked sailor moon I have to say it's a favorite of mine, I can't wait to watch the movies.Overall: 9. Worth a watch, definitely. eyes.Sound: 8. The ops and eds where great!character: 7.

Worth a watch, definitely."", ""I originally watched this when it first aired and thought it was decent. Nothing that great. I originally gave it a 7 based on my memories of watching it five years ago.Recently I decided to rewatch the 90s Sailor Moon as my memories of it had faded and then do a rewatch of Crystal right after to compare them. A lot of people are going to disagree but I'm going to say that I actually enjoy Crystal more. It gets far more hate than it deserves. Yes, there were a lot of animation mistakes in the original run and some general weirdness, but I'm writing...this review based on the bluray.I feel like the first season could have been a bit longer than 12 episodes. It should have been more like 17-24 to give more time for the inner senshi other than Sailor Moon to have a chance to shine and show their personalities and individuality. At the same time I greatly enjoy the vastly superior pacing in Crystal compared to the original.In the bluray version the animation is pretty good. I also enjoy the new transformations and soundtrack. Both are amazing. Moon Pride is so good that it beats Moonlight Densetsu hands down even if Moonlight Densetsu is a wonderful classic. Sailor Mars' theme is amazingly good too. I also think that Crystal has a superior portrayal of Usagi and Mamarou's relationship. You can really feel their chemistry in this version which was kind of lacking in the original.Overall 8/10. I always get bored and quit after the first season in both versions but I'll be trying my hardest to complete both versions of the show this time. I think the lack of filler and better pacing will make it a lot easier for me to finish Crystal than the original 90s run. this review based on the bluray.I feel like the first season could have been a bit longer than 12 episodes.

There were so many emotions welled up inside me that I couldn't possibly write them all down in this review. Despite what everyone else says this anime is must watch for any Sailor Moon fan, new or old.StoryThis adaptation follows the manga much more closely than the 90s anime, which was a great and bad thing. It meant having the story make more sense since everything was delivered without pointless filler that reduced or removed character development. However, the way it was planned out hurt it in...the long run. The series takes up two arcs of the manga: the beginning and the dark moon arc. With two arcs and only twenty-six episode, the show had rushed episodes with every episode covering exactly one chapter in the manga. That was fine in the beginning, however when the show reached the climax, the ending was slightly rushed in order to fit the 'one chapter = one episode' strategy they made. Even so, the story is still follow-able and something you can enjoy.ArtI'll be honest here, we all know that the art wasn't the best, but most people think that series has terrible art all the way through. During the first few episodes, you can see that the animators were clearly getting used to it and some were fairly new, so you ended up with some rare awkward shots. The show has shown me some amazing and detailed shots as well, such as when *incoming spoiler* Usagi had to get up again to fight after seeing her teammates die in front of her *ending spoiler*.SoundI'll keep this one short: the soundtrack and seiyuus were amazing. The opening song (Moon Pride) always got me hyped and the ending song (Moonbow) was perfect to relax to after seeing an intense fight. Yasuharu Takanashi's OST always set the perfect mood to any scene and I bought the soundtrack as soon as came out to listen to his sweet, sweet tunes. Each seiyuu truly put their effort into their roles and successfully portrayed the emotion needed in a scene.CharacterThe character development wasn't a big part of this series, the same as the manga which mostly used them to tell the story. But even so, you can enjoy each of the characters. I still heavily relate to Makoto and how she struggles to not look overpowering despite her large stature. As with the manga, the series still heavily focuses on Usagi, since she's the title character after all, but the other girls did get some development on their introductions and afterwards.EnjoymentAs I stated in the beginning, Crystal is a must-watch for old and new fans who want to watch the series animated without a mountain of filler to either suffer through or skip. At this point, I've watched this about three times, both the original animation and the blu-ray release, because that's just how much I enjoyed this show. Sailor Moon is a large part of my life since this is the show I'm passionate about other than idol shows. I really hope this review shines a more positive light than other fans hoping to see the 90s anime re-animated. the long run. The series takes up two arcs of the manga: the beginning and the dark moon arc. With two arcs and only twenty-six episode, the show had rushed episodes with every episode covering exactly one chapter in the manga. That was fine in the beginning, however when the show reached the climax, the ending was slightly rushed in order to fit the 'one chapter = one episode' strategy they made. Even so, the story is still follow-able and something you can enjoy.ArtI'll be honest here, we all know that the art wasn't the best, but most people think that series has terrible art all the way through.

It\'s becoming really toxic.. It\'s worse than some of those overly male-glorifying shows. Not to mention the directing is getting worse.The main protagonist, Usagi, gets super overly-glorified despite having some huge character flaws (being irresponsible etc), and her friends are just there to prop her up and praise her all the time.I don\'t like how they are enforcing ""toxic hierarchy"" in this show and how it focuses on how there is this one ""best girl"" who everyone likes.There is also this underlying current that the author doesn\'t really care about her friends...and the ""priority"" is to be the ""best girl"" who is born a princess, who gets the best prince, who has her other female friends there to serve, praise and follow her and to be the girl who saves everyone (physically and spiritually) with her kindness together with her prince.. - which pretty much sums up the show so far.She is born gifted, has godlike powers yet still insists that she\'s normal..?Additionally, guess what? The main male in this show gets even more glorification than in male-orientated shows. -_-#I hope females will not watch this show and pick up such toxic mentality. and the ""priority"" is to be the ""best girl"" who is born a princess, who gets the best prince, who has her other female friends there to serve, praise and follow her and to be the girl who saves everyone (physically and spiritually) with her kindness together with her prince.. - which pretty much sums up the show so far.She is born gifted, has godlike powers yet still insists that she\'s normal..?Additionally, guess what? The main male in this show gets even more glorification than in male-orientated shows. -_-#I hope females will not watch this show and pick up such toxic mentality.', ""My two cents includes nothing that hasn't been said already, at least to my knowledge.Crystal was super hyped but failed to live up to it. While I enjoy the faster pace of the series and the fact that they generally abandoned the Youma of the Day model, the animation is increasingly hard to ignore. The magic-oriented sequences make the Senshi look as if they're made of rubber, and the overt CGI in the transformations make me think of early Pixar rather than something we'd use in 2015.My lukewarm reception to this series is truly a heartbreak for me, as Sailor Moon was my gateway to...the anime world (my first hunted-down sub, no less). Part of me wants them to drop the project completely, but the upcoming Infinity arc - known as Sailor Moon S in the original anime - is my favorite, and I'm a tad intrigued to see what they do with the Death Busters.However, I should note the writers for Crystal seem slightly more - for lack of a better term - ballsy than those who participated in the original anime. Killing off Pluto in the second season was a big deal, and I think it was handled gracefully in terms of dialogue and timing. Of course, she will return in the Infinity arc unless they divert completely from the original plot, but actually acknowledging death in a major way is a good change, as the 1990s anime often glossed over it. the anime world (my first hunted-down sub, no less).

Review will be edited... eventually.*I can only imagine, that relatively low score for this show is either earned by those, who grew up watching the old show - like yours truly - or from those, who are fans of the manga and not so much of the anime, OR from those, who are just thrown away by this ""new-age art style a la CGI""- animation, and think it as a canser of the art-form that so many of us love, and admire - like yours truly! Either way, I\'m with them, since the original Sailor Moon is actually one...of my favourite animes of all time, and this clumsy, empty, clunky mess of two whole seasons, compressed - do not laugh - only in 26 episodes, really really REALLY pissed me off! In so many levels of estrogen, that you don\'t even know!!Oh boy, where to start?! Okay... first, the good news! The openin song was nice.Yeah! I\'m not even kidding right now!The opening song is indeed nice... if I don\'t need to see the actual animation - such a horror of cheap CGI! The song was catchy, powerful, and managed to embrace the themes and the story of Sailor Moon itself relatively well - just a little bit too pushy with that ""not all girls need a man to help them""- kinda propaganda, if you know the original show, but... I\'m just gonna let that stand, for now!In fact, the soundtarck as a whole, can be described as decent, at WORST! It\'s not so peppy and up-going, like its 90\'s grandmummy was, with happy flutes, sad violines and dramatic drums, but instead, really mellow, sooth and really... orchestra-like, with all the high vocals and... dear I even say... epic overtone. It was a big change to the original, indeed, but a nice one, and I have no problems with that.Secondly, if I have to mention this, for not to sound a total douchebag for not liking this show, those little segments between the halfs of the episodes, with those pastel-colored pictures and those little melodies, were absolutely beautiful, and I just loved them! Marvelous, period! Nothing more to say about that!Okay, so... that was the good part. Now comes the bad! To those, who are yet not familiar with my style of reviewing the shows, I usually never ever touch the subjects of art, nor sounds, since those two are to me two the most least... important aspects in any show. In this case, however... I\'m gonna keep my ground on this one, too. At least, on the art department! Those transformations with that horrible CGI were by no means awful, but except for that, I have no bigger quarrels against the art overall over here! It\'s new, and it takes things differently, following the styles and traditions of its own time, like the original did in it\'s time, in it\'s style, and I get it. The times change! No sins here for me!The sound, however... Yeah. I really did miss the music of the original show! The old music! The good music! The music, that was happy, and sad, and lively, and dangerous, and epic, and... and had a soul! The old soundtrack had a soul! This one... didn\'t! I can\'t remember not even one soundtrack from the Crystal, and it\'s sad, because... the opening was so nice! What went wrong, you guys?! This is just... no! No!Secondly, the story. Yeah... this is going to be tedious! The story itself was... well, it was compressed, to say the least. Details were lost and the corners were cut... heavily! And then, it was compressed, yet again! And then, it was edited, and then edited again, and again, so that what was eventually left, was just some really sad, and bare-boned core of a story, that in the original show, used to have a character, humor, sadness, some hardships and seriousness in it as well, without forgeting some teny tiny horror elements as well, and a romance! Don\'t forget the romance!This story however, had... well... It had Usagi in it. And.. she\'s the main heroine, so... not much else needed, I guess. Right... yay? Blah...!Okay, so... the story sucks! I admit, its sounds really, really weird to me to say this, since I so loved the story in the original, but... hey, when I eat the apple, I want the juicy, succulant meat, and not the seedy core! The story, in the Crystal, has absolutely nothing going on, and without all of those elements from the original show, I\'m actually legitimately surprised that they didn\'t bother to edit the rest of the story into the oblivion too, while they were at it! Everything, that was about anything, was heavily centered around Usagi, and since the story is so rushed, and empty, with no important or outsanding key-elements - unlike it\'s predecessor - even Usagi\'s character feels like empty and boring shell of a character, that I used to even like in the original show!Everything in the story, is without almost any conflict, or drama, and if something needs to get done... it gets done, just like that! Everything is so quick, and easy, that it\'s almost insulting, and not earned, or engrossing at all! I remember, when Queen Beryl used to be - or at least used to feel like - this big and threathening obsticle, that took absolutely everyhting there was to give to overcome, same with those four Generals, four evil sisters, prince Diamond, Black Lady and the Wiseman, since the Crystal decided to take both two seasons into one! In here, there are little to no time for the villains to interract, and so, I couldn\'t really care any less, wheter or not they lived or died... which is something, that I used to live through, with a certain other franchise as well - ten points to anyone, who guesses, which one! There was no drama, no connection, and no... no epicness, no emotion, that the original show had, that we got to see through the relationships and the emotions between all the characters, and I really missed that! When the villains got defeated - or in some cases, turned into good side - it felt like something. When the inner senshi died one by one, in order to protect their dear friend, that I myself saw and knew being their good friend, it was truly sad, and meaningful. In here, if someone was killed, or if someone was defeated, it felt like nothing, and it really hurt, since the story was already so bare-boned, and empty, that it at least needed something to happen!The only thing, that I can give any credit for, was the romance between Serenity and Endymion... and even that felt worsed, and undeserved! It didn\'t feel like Usagi and Mamoru were in love, but like Serenity and Endymion just stole their bodies for themselves, in a time of convenience, and thus forced them to love each other... because of whatever! That\'s an identity theft, and somehow even worse, that what prince Diamond tried to do!And lastly, it all comes down to the characters! Or like... what characters, since the only big character, that I can even think off of ever having any actual meaning, or interaction with the events of the story, was Usagi, and even she was a total bore! The original Usagi, was childish, clumsy, quirky, weird and funny, with her caring, loyal and sweet side, and most importantly... she was a total scaredy cat and a cry-baby! In the original show, she wasted the whole first season about whining, that she didn\'t want to be a soldier, and that she just wanted to be a normal girl, but in here, it\'s all said an done, in about... well, never! There\'s nothing to overcome, and no inner turmoils to rebel against, like any person would normally do, in the situation given her here! She just accepts her being this reincarnation of agient princess of the Moon and magical worrier, and that\'s it! She doesn\'t whine, she doesn\'t cry nor protest against the fact, that her whole life is now changed forever, without even her own say-so... she\'s not even that scared about anything! That isn\'t reasonable! She just does, what is needed, and nothing else... literally!Even lesser can be said, about the other inner senshi! They have absolutely no personalities of their own, no ambitions and I swear... no connection with each other, other than this totally bogus aspect of a past life that they shared together, and are now stuck with, yet again, in the second lifetime - this is not loyalty, nor friendship, but more like a bisnes contract, or a simple responsibility... like cleaning your room every monday!All the time, that was given to flesh-out the characters in the original show, was cut-down and edited to the absolute minimun, so that what we got in the end, was nothing less, than some pretty faces in sexy costumes, and not much else! Did you know, that Amy wants to be a doctor, just like her mother? No, because there\'s no time for that - no one likes Amy that much! Or did you know, that Rei wants to be a bisnes-woman, and is truly passionate about love, but only in her own terms? No, because there\'s no time for that! Makoto wants to open up her own shop one day and loves cooking, and Minako wants to be a famous superstar, but who cares, since they\'re not that important anyway, to the continuity of the story! Usagi\'s literaly the only one, that\'s given any amount of time to grow and develope, and even that - what ever little there was - was done so poorly, and hastely, that it almost felt like cheating! It\'s not emergive, it\'s not fun, and it\'s not... it\'s not deserved! What ever the original Usagi was, she deserved, through tears and hardships, and this Usagi... she does nothing! She deserves nothing! But, unlike her team mates, at least she\'s given even just some of her own personal lines to deliver, and not just some filler-lines and meaningless bantering - since all the inner senshi has exact same personalities, it\'s all the same, what they say, because Usagi can\'t be talking all the time!And... about those four generals, and the inner senshi... I didn\'t buy that. Not once. No. No shipping from me, gals. Sorry.Overall, this was really poor take! I mean... really poor! And still, I somehow ended up watching it through, and not thinking so badly about it. It was pretty - for some parts! - and some aspects were done atleast decently, and whatever new it brought on the table, that the original show didn\'t, was fascinating, and kept me going, even if the heavy cuts on the editing table were both seen, and felt, at the same time! It wasn\'t that awful, but it defenately wasn\'t good either! I will propably see this again, but only because I\'ve already seen, and loved the original series to the bone!I wouldn\'t never ever NEVER recommend this show to those, who haven\'t yet seen the original show, and are wondering, wheter or not to even start watching it at all. This is not that famous short cut to the fame and glory, that seems like an easy and fun way to go, but only ends to the disaster!

A dream that felt like riding on a roller-coaster.""Usagi Tsukino, Episode 26, Sailor Moon CrystalNow I truly understand why people take such a strong stance against remakes of classic anythings unless it is done near-perfectly.Let us break this down.Story: 6/10Sailor Moon Crystal covers two major arcs, arc one dealing with the Dark Kingdom and the various minions it has. This arc lasts about 13.5 episodes. Arc two deals with the Black Moon Clan and a few of it\'s minions also, and lasts about 12.5 episodes. Arc one also deals with a blossoming romance between the...main heroine named Usagi Tsukino (the titular Sailor Moon herself) and the main man Marmoru Chiba (Tuxedo Mask, or as I like to affectionately call him, Zoro). Arc two also deals with the interaction between those two dealing with the straining addition of Chibi-Usa.The story overall for this is not that special. There are no Metal Gear Solid-like reveals, there are no half-written Evangelion endings, and it stays mostly straightforward. However, even the various individual episode plots are never that special either. To put it in Trope-speak: ""It\'s so Ok, it\'s Average.""Art: 6/10Let me just say this here, when you are going to do a remake of an anime, take at least this one page from SMC. Go all out. (Edit: Put more work into the model\'s animation, and less into the model\'s look) The art style is remniscent of the long-legged and pointy-chin style that we\'ve seen in other series such as Code Geass, but in all reality it actually hearkens back to the designs in the original manga. It is sharp and stunning in the action scenes, and smooth and enjoyable in any slower-paced scenes.Art section edit: After rewatching some scenes, there were a few things I noticed. Unlike the Manga and the original series, the range of facial expressions is actually pretty flat. If not for the voice-work, I would have a difficult time understanding what emotions the characters are expressing. It still looks beautiful, but the beauty is tarnished by the lack of change within it. It reminds me a bit of some modern AAA video games, with great graphics but lacking in the animation department.Further edit: The backgrounds are actually alot more dull then I first recall. This is excusable in the last 6 or so episodes, which take place primarily in empty space-areas. But alot of the earlier episodes are in places that should be busy and bustling, or vivid and imaginative. This almost never happens. Crowds of people never show up despite it being Tokyo, ya know, the most populated city in the world. All the buildings are generic save for the good ole\' Tokyo Tower. Even the Arctic Circle looks more barren then real life makes it! The headquarters for the Dark Kingdom and Black Moon both are lacking, but they try to get around their own dullness by shoving excessive amounts of pillars into every room (That goes off about as well as you think).Sound: 9/10The sound is amazing. Every voice (except one, Wiseman\'s from the Second Arc) fits marvelously. The sound effects are perfectly placed and used. And the music, OH GOD the music is wonderful! I can not think of one scene during the show where the music was not amazing. The only reason this gets a 9 rather then a 10 is for one simple reason. The main theme and closing theme. The closing theme is actually pretty skippable, and the opening is good, but does not match the series. While the series puts an intense focus on the relationship between Usagi and Marmoru, the main theme puts the focus on the \'independence\' of the Sailor Senshi, and females as a whole. In all reality, the classic Moonlight Densetsu would have fit better for this version of the anime then the original 90\'s one, as it focuses on romance rather then female friendship and fighting. This contrast, and the forgettable closing theme, drops it one point.Character: 3/10This is where the series suffers the most. For starters, the characterization for the majority of the cast stagnates shortly after their initial introduction, the only real exception being for Usagi, Marmoru, and Chibi-Usa.I didn\'t really want to compare SMC to the original Sailor Moon anime, but for the sake of explanation I will. Each character in the original Sailor Moon had a life and a strong friendship with the main character. Sailor Mercury/Ami Mizuino was an shy, intelligent female that struggled to fit in with her piers, even after gaining the abilities of the Senshi. Sailor Mars/Rei Hino was a fiery Shinto priest, who was very quick to snap at any opportunity for fame or a nice guy, and despite her rivalry with Sailor Moon was fiercely loyal to her. Sailor Jupiter/Makoto Kino was a strong fighter that had a repressed \'housewife-y\' feminine side to her, and had trouble letting go of her past. etc. We learned these things (and more) about these characters over meeting and interacting with them time and time again. Even between the Senshi, their would be rivalries, understandings, and more. It made the characters alive, relatable, and memorable.In SMC, outside of their introduction episodes, the characters rarely get to showcase themselves as people independent of their duties in battle. With a slight exception from Sailor Jupiter (Who gains a romantic interest and is most willing to do things), all 4 supporting senshi have mostly generic lines of support and encouragement toward the main character, all which could be mostly swapped between them. Each one never is her own person, and unless the plot demands they find out information, they never do their own thing beyond their introductory episode. Furthermore, in the second arc they almost never do anything with Usagi to showcase any sort of friendship with her, or between eachother. Personality wise, they all feel almost the same.If that is not enough, they progressively become more and more useless. All four of them burst onto the scene with abilities and fight alongside Sailor Moon, acting like a true team. By about episode 11 though, this teamwork gradually evaporates, and all four go through a bad case of \'Badass Decay\' which leaves them all unable to put up any fight (Slight exception again to Jupiter). This is even more egregious when the final episodes of the second arc actively forces the four of them to stay behind during the final climax.(Special exception to Sailor Pluto, who actually becomes a very interesting fleshed out character. She ended up being the best thing of the second half of the second arc.)This problem also encompasses the villains. A highlight of the original first season of Sailor Moon was the amazing development given to the villains. Here? Nothing of the sort at all. All four of the major underlings are god-forsaken cookie-cutter enemies in the first arc, and said arc\'s two Big Bads have a generic 1 minute backstory and no backstory, respectively. This is not as bad in the Second arc, but they also stay mostly shallow despite having a very interesting backstory.Lastly for this section, I must say that I didn\'t like the way Sailor Moon was portrayed here. She is not an everygirl with limited abilities that fights through with will and friendship all while being an emotional crybaby, which is what she was in the original anime even after being revealed as royalty. In SMC, she starts out similar to this but halfway through the first arc morphs into a bland, angsty character that repeatedly tries to Suicide and cries without ever attempting to do anything except escape the situation as fast as she can. SMC\'s Sailor Moon is NOT a fighter unless her back is to a wall. Granted, she is nowhere near the level of Shinji Ikari (Evangelion franchise), but she is no longer a strong female lead roll.Enjoyment: 4/10The original anime series took a generic story and made it amazing with great characters, which is why it is so fondly recalled. It was enjoyed greatly primarily for the characters, something that even filtered through the extensive cuts and edits in the old English dubs. Sailor Moon Crystal takes the same concept and reduces character depth and screentime in favor of primarily working on the romantic angle whenever it did want to work on characterization and character interaction. This leaves much to be desired.Each arc started out great, as the situation was established and the team would fight off mooks. But as the arc would come toward the conclusion, everything would fall apart. Scenes would be dragged out for the sake of drama, rules that were established one episode would be overcome in the next one due to \'power of love\', and all they would turn into is a drawn out energy battle  until the main two characters got together and power-of-loved the enemy into non-existence. While this is often a trope of this genre, the leadup to the final battle was dull, with the Senshi exchanging generic supporting lines and Sailor Moon typically angsting until Tuxedo Mask shows up. There was nothing to give it spice or flavor, and the last third of both arcs were merely going through the motions to finish themselves up.Overall: 5/10In the end, it\'s just a an average anime. By no means is it terrible, despite what many fans of the franchise like to claim. It is a visually a beautiful work (Edit: Kinda beautiful, see above), and the official soundtrack for this would be something I would highly recommend to everyone. Yet that aside, it takes a typical magical girl story and puts three good characters with it, along with a host of two-dimensional ones. SMC lacks the charm for it to be a well-loved classic, but for any fan of the Sailor Moon franchise, casual or diehard, it is something worth checking out. That said, I wouldn\'t recommend this to someone interested in looking into the franchise for the first time. main heroine named Usagi Tsukino (the titular Sailor Moon herself) and the main man Marmoru Chiba (Tuxedo Mask, or as I like to affectionately call him, Zoro). Arc two also deals with the interaction between those two dealing with the straining addition of Chibi-Usa.The story overall for this is not that special. There are no Metal Gear Solid-like reveals, there are no half-written Evangelion endings, and it stays mostly straightforward. However, even the various individual episode plots are never that special either. To put it in Trope-speak: ""It\'s so Ok, it\'s Average.""Art: 6/10Let me just say this here, when you are going to do a remake of an anime, take at least this one page from SMC. Go all out. (Edit: Put more work into the model\'s animation, and less into the model\'s look) The art style is remniscent of the long-legged and pointy-chin style that we\'ve seen in other series such as Code Geass, but in all reality it actually hearkens back to the designs in the original manga. It is sharp and stunning in the action scenes, and smooth and enjoyable in any slower-paced scenes.Art section edit: After rewatching some scenes, there were a few things I noticed. Unlike the Manga and the original series, the range of facial expressions is actually pretty flat. If not for the voice-work, I would have a difficult time understanding what emotions the characters are expressing. It still looks beautiful, but the beauty is tarnished by the lack of change within it. It reminds me a bit of some modern AAA video games, with great graphics but lacking in the animation department.Further edit: The backgrounds are actually alot more dull then I first recall. This is excusable in the last 6 or so episodes, which take place primarily in empty space-areas. But alot of the earlier episodes are in places that should be busy and bustling, or vivid and imaginative. This almost never happens. Crowds of people never show up despite it being Tokyo, ya know, the most populated city in the world. All the buildings are generic save for the good ole\' Tokyo Tower. Even the Arctic Circle looks more barren then real life makes it! The headquarters for the Dark Kingdom and Black Moon both are lacking, but they try to get around their own dullness by shoving excessive amounts of pillars into every room (That goes off about as well as you think).Sound: 9/10The sound is amazing. Every voice (except one, Wiseman\'s from the Second Arc) fits marvelously. The sound effects are perfectly placed and used. And the music, OH GOD the music is wonderful! I can not think of one scene during the show where the music was not amazing. The only reason this gets a 9 rather then a 10 is for one simple reason. The main theme and closing theme. The closing theme is actually pretty skippable, and the opening is good, but does not match the series. While the series puts an intense focus on the relationship between Usagi and Marmoru, the main theme puts the focus on the \'independence\' of the Sailor Senshi, and females as a whole. In all reality, the classic Moonlight Densetsu would have fit better for this version of the anime then the original 90\'s one, as it focuses on romance rather then female friendship and fighting. This contrast, and the forgettable closing theme, drops it one point.Character: 3/10This is where the series suffers the most. For starters, the characterization for the majority of the cast stagnates shortly after their initial introduction, the only real exception being for Usagi, Marmoru, and Chibi-Usa.I didn\'t really want to compare SMC to the original Sailor Moon anime, but for the sake of explanation I will.

The transformation sequences are way too long to be shown for each episode and so like at-least 1/4 of the episode is transformation sequences. I love the soundtrack in the beginning and the music when they introduce themselves to their enemies or the transformation music makes the sailors look really majestic. Since this adaptation is very close to the manga and not the original 90's show the characters are much more mature and the one thing I LOVE the most that makes me really prefer crystal over the original 90's version is how each...sailor is introduced. The way they are introduced really shows their character and what they stand and fight for. How the items they have are given to them in a manner that makes sense unlike the original 90's anime where they just randomly get it or have to acquire it in a way that makes it like very long but in this version it really is better. I love both the original and the crystal but the crystal is short and easy while the original is just too much filler and you mainly watch it for nostalgia. sailor is introduced.

I highly recommend watching it if you like that kind of thing.I personally liked this anime because of the magic element, as well as the outer space references. The romance is cute too (Although Usagi is a little bit childish through the whole thing), as well as a pretty good plot....This anime involves a sort of ""villain of the week"" type of thing, and there is some good mystery that isn\'t blatantly obvious.

HUGE dissapointment for someone who grew both reading and watching the original Sailor Moon.I started to watch the Crystal series when it came out in 2014 and I remembered being super hyped about it. I watched 14 episodes before I dropped it out of boredom. Years later I decided to pick it up again and watch the rest since I was fairly surprised to find out it had two more seasons.I tried my very best to overlook my nostalgia and compare it the original 90's series since it's bound to...be different.

This adaptation is said to be more closer to Naoko Takeuchi\'s original manga and is an awesome series....or is it? Well, here\'s what I think.Unfortunately the first two seasons of this anime are nothing short of a complete disaster, a complete insult to Naoko Takeuchi and the Sailor Moon franchise (anime/manga), and fail...to capture the charm of the original anime and manga. Why? Let me tell you why this is the WORST version of Sailor Moon that has ever been created:- The art and animation are abysmal, hopelessly bad. One of the things that attracted people to the original manga and anime was its beautiful, gorgeous, charming, and cute artwork (and the anime had mostly fluid animation despite its repeated use of stock footage in episodes, the original anime did have a limited budget. Some people say the original was a ""generic moe"" style, but I say it was a shoujo style too). While most of the backgrounds are a step up from the original anime series, particularly places like Crystal Tokyo and Juuban City, the characters and the animation are not. The characters, which are supposed to look more like Naoko\'s wonderful drawings, look nothing like them and are just poorly drawn. The art looks extremely sketchy, the characters are off model looking for practically most of the series, with their faces and eyes constantly changing and expressing no believable emotions. Their eyes even get misaligned at times and proportions are extremely off, and for some reason all of the girls, even little Chibi-Usa have this weird lip gloss that makes them look terrible. The animation is also very stiff, choppy, and jerky, and animation errors in coloring and anatomy constantly about, it\'s a mess. It\'s sad that the first two seasons of modern anime, which had a lower budget than the original and took two to three weeks to produce, look worse than the original anime, which was low budget and only took one week, the original didn\'t even look like it was a low budget one done in a week! Also, the Blu-Rays of the show most of the time would look even worse than the original web version, and sometimes add in more errors that the web never had. Some of the backgrounds also, particularly apocalyptic Crystal Tokyo and the Dark Kingdom also, and a lot of the battles during backgrounds, are also filled with monochromatic, dull, flat colors that suck the life out of the series, compared to how the original anime had a good balance between bright, shiny colors and dark, dull colors.And don\'t even get me started on the CGI transformations...my God, they were terrible, horrible models, unnatural sloppy animation that makes me feel nauseous, the dark blue silhouettes of the characters (and Mercury\'s pinkish one) don\'t go well with the backgrounds, and with cheap, terrible effects, Mercury\'s CGI one is a perfect example how not to do one. And when they get to the second arc, they took the lazy route and only changed the brooch and pens of the Sailors to try to fool the viewer into thinking the transformation was different, at least Toei in the 90\'s did different backgrounds/animations and colored the Sailors\' bodies differently for each power-up. Some scenes in the manga that were epic fall flat in Crystal due to how it is presented also, like the Double Moon Princess Halation, which was ruined due to Moon and Chibi Moon being drawn poorly and the animation being jerky.I\'m sorry also, but character designer Yukie Sato is also one of the worst artists I\'ve ever seen, her artwork most of the time is just completely lifeless and like she just drew everything in one shot, one sketch.- The pacing of the story/adaptation of the manga is terrible. This show brings in a flaw of the manga that the original anime improved upon despite its great amount of filler episodes: the pacing of the story is too fast. The story rushes by so quick it feels really rushed and no one will be able to relate to or get interested in any of the characters (which will be explained in a bit).Being too close to the manga as a shot by shot episode more hurts the series rather than benefiting it and even brings up flaws that never were discovered before, like for example, why even give the Inner Senshi Star Power wands if Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, three of them, are going to be captured for most of the arc?While some people may not be bothered too much by there being no filler, the problem is that the lack of it bites the show in its behind by making the characters seem uninteresting them and not even developing most of, if not all of them, one of the reasons why the original anime was better than the manga (though I still do like the manga) was because the characters were fleshed out over each season, sure there may have been filler in the original that did go out of control (SuperS) but a lot of them were character focus episodes that helped us like some of the most famous characters in anime. The Inner/Outer Senshi not developing was the biggest flaw the manga had.And as if that isn\'t bad enough, the show isn\'t even faithful to the manga at all, they are constantly adding deviations to the show that make it veer away from the source material to the point where it doesn\'t even capture the tone of it. Certain examples are making Ami get hypnotized by that evil disk when she wasn\'t in the manga, and having Usagi have to free her by saying Ami is her friend although they\'ve just met, and Sailor Moon revealing her identity to Rei in her episode. One definitely big no-no was a scene where it looked like Usagi was trying to pull away from Mamoru whilst he gave her a kiss, as though he forced a kiss on her, when all he did in the manga was just kiss her tenderly.And the less said about the Four Generals trainwreck which I\'m sure we all know about and Sailor Venus\' big moment being ruined, (both of which were also added into the show) the better, which leads to the second biggest elephant in the room next to the artwork:- Horrendous characterization. It\'s been said that Crystal ""humanized the characters and fleshed them out unlike the 90\'s anime"", and that the characters\' feelings were ""deeper than the 90\'s anime."" Seriously? No, really, did we see the same show? No, we haven\'t, or rather, we didn\'t see both shows the same way.Another great reason that Sailor Moon was popular with people all around the world were its characters, and they are not done justice here at all, having some of the worst characterization I\'ve ever seen.Usagi/Sailor Moon (who was a klutzy crybaby but also a very kind hearted, caring, and later more mature person in the manga and original anime) in Sailor Moon Crystal is a complete immature Mary Sue who only cares about her lover Tuxedo Mask/Mamoru, just abandons her friends a lot of the time during important parts, is extremely irresponsible and a pathetic fighter, as she runs away from her duties, cries for help when only her arm is grabbed once, commits suicide just so she can be with her dead boyfriend, always has to rely on Mamoru to protect her, and just gets everything she wants in the end. Don\'t get me started on how she gets jealous of Chibi-Usa when she wants to stay at Mamoru\'s house as she\'s scared and she thinks the little girl\'s gonna steal her boyfriend! She doesn\'t even mature nor develop here at all, that whole thing with Usagi claiming ""Chibi-Usa is another woman to Mamoru"" makes her dumber in here than she even was in the original anime (which she wasn\'t terribly dumb there) and to be honest, she\'s a bit too perfect in her manga counterpart too, and her maturing there doesn\'t feel all that realistic, but it\'s nowhere near as annoying as in Crystal. Also, Kotono Mitsuishi, her original VA, seems to be too old to do the role now, as her acting actually sounds painfully strained at points, mostly when she\'s yelling names like ""MERCURYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!"", I literally cringed hearing that.Mamoru/Tuxedo Mask, is pretty much similar to Usagi as he\'s pretty much just a Gary Stu, he always talks nice to her after the first few episodes, never says anything mean, more like just a fantasy dream of a perfect man, when no one is ever perfect. He is also a creep at times, considering the aforementioned forced kissing and one scene where he claims Usagi opened up her friends\' hearts when we\'re wondering, how the heck did he know that??? He and Moon are the only two who really matter here. Not to mention him turning evil again in the Black Moon arc was stupid (and don\'t get me started on that disgusting kiss, romantically kissing his own daughter! Yuck!).Sure, Mamoru acted like an idiot in that whole ""break-up"" thing in the original anime, but at least it showed he was only human and we all make stupid mistakes.The Inner Senshi, Ami/Sailor Mercury, Rei/Sailor Mars, Makoto/Sailor Jupiter, and Minako/Sailor Venus got the worst treatment here. They are given no personalities and characters whatsoever, are treated like crap, and are completely useless 98% of the time in battle. In battle, they are extremely weak, their attacks most of the time do not work outside of their introductory episodes, they get knocked out or down, and can\'t get up. While the original anime versions of the Inners were better, and they were more useful in battle there, even with some personality changes, in the manga the characters still showed bits of personality and all helped out in ways to shine, and all had interactions, whilst in Crystal, most of their accomplishments were either ignored or just given to Sailor Moon just so she could steal the spotlight. Their ""friendship"" with Usagi also is fake as they only exist to say how ""wonderful"" Usagi is whilst Usagi just leaves them for her Mamoru, and they are all completely interchangeable regardless of their Sailor Soldier Suit colors, Mercury could say something Jupiter was supposed to say, or the four of them could be deleted from the series entirely and nothing would change in the slightest. Also considering they give up and let themselves get attacked by their four bland and uninteresting lovers during that Four Generals trainwreck...When you have a series with a theme song boasting lyrics such as ""We will fight on our own without leaving our destiny to the prince"" and ""We are not helpless girls that need men\'s protection"" and the show shows the exact opposite, it\'s clear something really went wrong. In other words, Crystal is sexist.In the original anime, the Inners were far better used, were more useful in battle and stronger, had great importance in Classic-S, and even partially in Stars, though they were only shafted to the side in SuperS. They had their own focus episodes that developed them and fleshed them out, and they all got to shine in battles with their own tactics. In Crystal, the Inners have no importance whatsoever, and are really underused. In fact, I\'m starting to think Toei made the Inners useless on purpose in Crystal as a stupid excuse for failing to come up with ways to make their characters interesting or develop them.Other character wise, Chibi-Usa is just boring in season 2, and Luna, Artemis and Diana are just there.All the villains are bland with no personality whatsoever, and unlike how in the anime some of the got fleshed out and even redeemed in a good way, here a lot of them are just killed off before one can find them interesting. A lot of the final villains look very stupid too, like with Queen Metallia just being a purple CGI blob who wants to take over Earth because who knows why. Oh wait, we\'re never told. Some were just as bad as their manga counterparts like Prince Diamond, my God I HATED him in the manga.The music is also just boring and unmemorable, just generic chorus music a whole lot of the time that doesn\'t really hold any interest. Moon Pride is good, but its lyrics end up turning out to be a lie, and Moonbow is forgettable. The only music track I really loved was ""The Bonds of Love"", a pretty piano and violin piece.There are some good parts to Crystal though, like the voice acting, which is mostly decent to very good, despite the bad animation, the Sailor V game looks better than the original anime\'s, and Sailor Pluto had a far better role, plus her death was done very well and was sad, but these are so few and far in between they may as well not even be there. And even the voice acting itself is hit and miss; Kenji Nojima does an excellent job as Tuxedo Mask/Mamoru, but Usagi/Sailor Moon herself sounds too old, sadly Kotono Mitsuishi sounds old. They got Hisako Kanemoto (Cure Peace from Smile Precure) and Ami Kochimizu (Cure Melody from Suite Precure) to do Sailors Mercury and Jupiter/Ami Mizuno and Makoto Kino but their performances feel very sub-par compared to their previous roles; Mercury is decent but Jupiter\'s voice doesn\'t fit her character here. Rina Sato is fine as Rei/Sailor Mars, but Shizuka Itoh sounds too young for Sailor Venus/Minako (same thing with Ryo Hirohashi as Luna).Overall, despite its merchandise sales (mostly consisting of newer merchandise with the old anime version) the first two seasons of Sailor Moon Crystal were a huge flop and nearly killed the Sailor Moon franchise. It was all done just so money could be made, and the people at Toei Animation at the time couldn\'t give a darn if it was good or not. I would give it a 1/10 or 0/10 (this gets a 1 because unfortunately there is no number 0 option), and would even go so far as to call the two seasons the worst magical girl anime of all time. Naoko Takeuchi, who unfortunately doesn\'t seem to like her manga anymore (as she was disappointed in parts with it when it came out) most likely would not approve of this one. Thank goodness director Munehisa Sakai and art designer Yukie Sato left.Season III is much better than Seasons 1 and 2 though. I shall review it very soon, but until then, skip the first two seasons of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Crystal. You\'re not missing anything by skipping out on those, which as time passes, may end up drifting into obscurity and end up being forgotten, possibly for good reason.Story: 1/10 (Too close to the manga, yet at the same time, not even faithful to it due to stupid deviations and additions, and ends up sexist instead of female empowering)Art/Animation: 1/10 (Horrible quality art and animation, to the point where it looks like an unlicensed piece of garbage anime)Sound: 2/10 (Voice acting is mostly OK but the music is mostly terrible and forgettable).Character: 1/10 (Just pathetic. Only Sailor Pluto is a good character, along with Usagi\'s parents. Usagi is a whiny love makes you dumb Mary Sue who is obsessed with Mamoru, who is basically just like Edward from Twilight, the Inner Senshi may as well not even be in here at all as ""background character"" doesn\'t sound like a strong enough term to describe them, boring Chibi-Usa, bland uninteresting villains, to the point where I don\'t even care about anyone in this series)Enjoyment: 1/10 (I hated this with a burning passion and I can\'t even say anything good about it, in fact, it\'s making me wonder how I could have even enjoyed the manga version and the manga hasn\'t aged well)Overall: 1/10 (The worst version of Sailor Moon, and one of the worst TV shows/the worst anime I\'ve ever seen in my life) to capture the charm of the original anime and manga. Why? Let me tell you why this is the WORST version of Sailor Moon that has ever been created:- The art and animation are abysmal, hopelessly bad. One of the things that attracted people to the original manga and anime was its beautiful, gorgeous, charming, and cute artwork (and the anime had mostly fluid animation despite its repeated use of stock footage in episodes, the original anime did have a limited budget. Some people say the original was a ""generic moe"" style, but I say it was a shoujo style too). While most of the backgrounds are a step up from the original anime series, particularly places like Crystal Tokyo and Juuban City, the characters and the animation are not. The characters, which are supposed to look more like Naoko\'s wonderful drawings, look nothing like them and are just poorly drawn. The art looks extremely sketchy, the characters are off model looking for practically most of the series, with their faces and eyes constantly changing and expressing no believable emotions. Their eyes even get misaligned at times and proportions are extremely off, and for some reason all of the girls, even little Chibi-Usa have this weird lip gloss that makes them look terrible. The animation is also very stiff, choppy, and jerky, and animation errors in coloring and anatomy constantly about, it\'s a mess. It\'s sad that the first two seasons of modern anime, which had a lower budget than the original and took two to three weeks to produce, look worse than the original anime, which was low budget and only took one week, the original didn\'t even look like it was a low budget one done in a week! Also, the Blu-Rays of the show most of the time would look even worse than the original web version, and sometimes add in more errors that the web never had. Some of the backgrounds also, particularly apocalyptic Crystal Tokyo and the Dark Kingdom also, and a lot of the battles during backgrounds, are also filled with monochromatic, dull, flat colors that suck the life out of the series, compared to how the original anime had a good balance between bright, shiny colors and dark, dull colors.And don\'t even get me started on the CGI transformations...my God, they were terrible, horrible models, unnatural sloppy animation that makes me feel nauseous, the dark blue silhouettes of the characters (and Mercury\'s pinkish one) don\'t go well with the backgrounds, and with cheap, terrible effects, Mercury\'s CGI one is a perfect example how not to do one. And when they get to the second arc, they took the lazy route and only changed the brooch and pens of the Sailors to try to fool the viewer into thinking the transformation was different, at least Toei in the 90\'s did different backgrounds/animations and colored the Sailors\' bodies differently for each power-up. Some scenes in the manga that were epic fall flat in Crystal due to how it is presented also, like the Double Moon Princess Halation, which was ruined due to Moon and Chibi Moon being drawn poorly and the animation being jerky.I\'m sorry also, but character designer Yukie Sato is also one of the worst artists I\'ve ever seen, her artwork most of the time is just completely lifeless and like she just drew everything in one shot, one sketch.- The pacing of the story/adaptation of the manga is terrible. This show brings in a flaw of the manga that the original anime improved upon despite its great amount of filler episodes: the pacing of the story is too fast. The story rushes by so quick it feels really rushed and no one will be able to relate to or get interested in any of the characters (which will be explained in a bit).Being too close to the manga as a shot by shot episode more hurts the series rather than benefiting it and even brings up flaws that never were discovered before, like for example, why even give the Inner Senshi Star Power wands if Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter, three of them, are going to be captured for most of the arc?While some people may not be bothered too much by there being no filler, the problem is that the lack of it bites the show in its behind by making the characters seem uninteresting them and not even developing most of, if not all of them, one of the reasons why the original anime was better than the manga (though I still do like the manga) was because the characters were fleshed out over each season, sure there may have been filler in the original that did go out of control (SuperS) but a lot of them were character focus episodes that helped us like some of the most famous characters in anime. The Inner/Outer Senshi not developing was the biggest flaw the manga had.And as if that isn\'t bad enough, the show isn\'t even faithful to the manga at all, they are constantly adding deviations to the show that make it veer away from the source material to the point where it doesn\'t even capture the tone of it. Certain examples are making Ami get hypnotized by that evil disk when she wasn\'t in the manga, and having Usagi have to free her by saying Ami is her friend although they\'ve just met, and Sailor Moon revealing her identity to Rei in her episode. One definitely big no-no was a scene where it looked like Usagi was trying to pull away from Mamoru whilst he gave her a kiss, as though he forced a kiss on her, when all he did in the manga was just kiss her tenderly.And the less said about the Four Generals trainwreck which I\'m sure we all know about and Sailor Venus\' big moment being ruined, (both of which were also added into the show) the better, which leads to the second biggest elephant in the room next to the artwork:- Horrendous characterization. It\'s been said that Crystal ""humanized the characters and fleshed them out unlike the 90\'s anime"", and that the characters\' feelings were ""deeper than the 90\'s anime."" Seriously? No, really, did we see the same show? No, we haven\'t, or rather, we didn\'t see both shows the same way.Another great reason that Sailor Moon was popular with people all around the world were its characters, and they are not done justice here at all, having some of the worst characterization I\'ve ever seen.Usagi/Sailor Moon (who was a klutzy crybaby but also a very kind hearted, caring, and later more mature person in the manga and original anime) in Sailor Moon Crystal is a complete immature Mary Sue who only cares about her lover Tuxedo Mask/Mamoru, just abandons her friends a lot of the time during important parts, is extremely irresponsible and a pathetic fighter, as she runs away from her duties, cries for help when only her arm is grabbed once, commits suicide just so she can be with her dead boyfriend, always has to rely on Mamoru to protect her, and just gets everything she wants in the end. Don\'t get me started on how she gets jealous of Chibi-Usa when she wants to stay at Mamoru\'s house as she\'s scared and she thinks the little girl\'s gonna steal her boyfriend! She doesn\'t even mature nor develop here at all, that whole thing with Usagi claiming ""Chibi-Usa is another woman to Mamoru"" makes her dumber in here than she even was in the original anime (which she wasn\'t terribly dumb there) and to be honest, she\'s a bit too perfect in her manga counterpart too, and her maturing there doesn\'t feel all that realistic, but it\'s nowhere near as annoying as in Crystal. Also, Kotono Mitsuishi, her original VA, seems to be too old to do the role now, as her acting actually sounds painfully strained at points, mostly when she\'s yelling names like ""MERCURYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!"", I literally cringed hearing that.Mamoru/Tuxedo Mask, is pretty much similar to Usagi as he\'s pretty much just a Gary Stu, he always talks nice to her after the first few episodes, never says anything mean, more like just a fantasy dream of a perfect man, when no one is ever perfect. He is also a creep at times, considering the aforementioned forced kissing and one scene where he claims Usagi opened up her friends\' hearts when we\'re wondering, how the heck did he know that??? He and Moon are the only two who really matter here. Not to mention him turning evil again in the Black Moon arc was stupid (and don\'t get me started on that disgusting kiss, romantically kissing his own daughter! Yuck!).Sure, Mamoru acted like an idiot in that whole ""break-up"" thing in the original anime, but at least it showed he was only human and we all make stupid mistakes.The Inner Senshi, Ami/Sailor Mercury, Rei/Sailor Mars, Makoto/Sailor Jupiter, and Minako/Sailor Venus got the worst treatment here. They are given no personalities and characters whatsoever, are treated like crap, and are completely useless 98% of the time in battle. In battle, they are extremely weak, their attacks most of the time do not work outside of their introductory episodes, they get knocked out or down, and can\'t get up. While the original anime versions of the Inners were better, and they were more useful in battle there, even with some personality changes, in the manga the characters still showed bits of personality and all helped out in ways to shine, and all had interactions, whilst in Crystal, most of their accomplishments were either ignored or just given to Sailor Moon just so she could steal the spotlight. Their ""friendship"" with Usagi also is fake as they only exist to say how ""wonderful"" Usagi is whilst Usagi just leaves them for her Mamoru, and they are all completely interchangeable regardless of their Sailor Soldier Suit colors, Mercury could say something Jupiter was supposed to say, or the four of them could be deleted from the series entirely and nothing would change in the slightest. Also considering they give up and let themselves get attacked by their four bland and uninteresting lovers during that Four Generals trainwreck...When you have a series with a theme song boasting lyrics such as ""We will fight on our own without leaving our destiny to the prince"" and ""We are not helpless girls that need men\'s protection"" and the show shows the exact opposite, it\'s clear something really went wrong. In other words, Crystal is sexist.In the original anime, the Inners were far better used, were more useful in battle and stronger, had great importance in Classic-S, and even partially in Stars, though they were only shafted to the side in SuperS. They had their own focus episodes that developed them and fleshed them out, and they all got to shine in battles with their own tactics. In Crystal, the Inners have no importance whatsoever, and are really underused. In fact, I\'m starting to think Toei made the Inners useless on purpose in Crystal as a stupid excuse for failing to come up with ways to make their characters interesting or develop them.Other character wise, Chibi-Usa is just boring in season 2, and Luna, Artemis and Diana are just there.All the villains are bland with no personality whatsoever, and unlike how in the anime some of the got fleshed out and even redeemed in a good way, here a lot of them are just killed off before one can find them interesting. A lot of the final villains look very stupid too, like with Queen Metallia just being a purple CGI blob who wants to take over Earth because who knows why. Oh wait, we\'re never told. Some were just as bad as their manga counterparts like Prince Diamond, my God I HATED him in the manga.The music is also just boring and unmemorable, just generic chorus music a whole lot of the time that doesn\'t really hold any interest. Moon Pride is good, but its lyrics end up turning out to be a lie, and Moonbow is forgettable. The only music track I really loved was ""The Bonds of Love"", a pretty piano and violin piece.There are some good parts to Crystal though, like the voice acting, which is mostly decent to very good, despite the bad animation, the Sailor V game looks better than the original anime\'s, and Sailor Pluto had a far better role, plus her death was done very well and was sad, but these are so few and far in between they may as well not even be there. And even the voice acting itself is hit and miss; Kenji Nojima does an excellent job as Tuxedo Mask/Mamoru, but Usagi/Sailor Moon herself sounds too old, sadly Kotono Mitsuishi sounds old. They got Hisako Kanemoto (Cure Peace from Smile Precure) and Ami Kochimizu (Cure Melody from Suite Precure) to do Sailors Mercury and Jupiter/Ami Mizuno and Makoto Kino but their performances feel very sub-par compared to their previous roles; Mercury is decent but Jupiter\'s voice doesn\'t fit her character here. Rina Sato is fine as Rei/Sailor Mars, but Shizuka Itoh sounds too young for Sailor Venus/Minako (same thing with Ryo Hirohashi as Luna).Overall, despite its merchandise sales (mostly consisting of newer merchandise with the old anime version) the first two seasons of Sailor Moon Crystal were a huge flop and nearly killed the Sailor Moon franchise. It was all done just so money could be made, and the people at Toei Animation at the time couldn\'t give a darn if it was good or not. I would give it a 1/10 or 0/10 (this gets a 1 because unfortunately there is no number 0 option), and would even go so far as to call the two seasons the worst magical girl anime of all time. Naoko Takeuchi, who unfortunately doesn\'t seem to like her manga anymore (as she was disappointed in parts with it when it came out) most likely would not approve of this one.

Something that I hated about the 90s was the way the moon family was portrayed. By this I mean Mamoru and Chibiusa. I felt that Mamoru lacked character and the transition from his character prior to regaining his memories was very rushed and shabby. It was as if he just became a completely different person, and we did not end up seeing the sassy Mamoru fall for Usagi. I also...hated how bratty and disrespectful Chibiusa was portrayed in the 90s especially since she knew that Usagi is her mother. I must still acknowledge that the 90s anime did occasionally dish out some quality scenes where the moon family interacts well and understandably towards Usagi.Crystal, however, portrayed the moon family in a way where it was rather wholesome and sweet. The transition between Mamoru before and after regaining his memories is much smoother and the relationship between him and Usagi is much more developed. I also really REALLY love how Chibiusa is better portrayed as an actual child who loves and respects her mother. It is very endearing.Aside from character portrayal and relations, Crystal obviously does a very good job in the music department. The songs are very catchy and adorable. hated how bratty and disrespectful Chibiusa was portrayed in the 90s especially since she knew that Usagi is her mother.

Touted as a remake of the original that more closely follows the manga, it fails on nearly all fronts that an anime can, only surviving due to the inherent appeal of the original IP. While I'm sure many exist in the genres I avoid, I personally have not encountered an anime with such blatant disregard for the basic building blocks of story or animation in some time.Sailor Moon Crystal's animation is atrocious. Characters often pause on in-between frames that were clearly not designed to be seen, with distorted faces and incorrect proportions. Pacing between or during scenes can...often cause major confusion due to a lack of narrative through-line and poor conveyence of information. CG is often used blatantly to cut corners, with the worst offenses being in both the OP and transformation scenes, ruining both. I've heard comparisons to Betty Spaghetti dolls, and I can't disagree.With animation this poor, the story really needs to pick up the pieces, but it doesn't. Sailor Moon Crystal's characters are consistently shafted, meaning you learn very little about who they are or why you should care. They don't really interact enough for you to consider the cast friends, either. Character building just doesn't happen here, which makes the emotional scenes about them feel all the more absurd.The plot? It's entirely off the rails, if I'm honest. While at first it seems like a nice and cute magical girl anime, it very quickly becomes something more close to Kingdom Hearts, with moon clones and light and darkness, made-up-on-the-spot plot points, reincarnation, time travel, and more. It feels like the writers tried to put every idea for a story they ever had into a single anime and I can't call it anything other than bad.The biggest issue is in the second season, after time travel is introduced. The sheer number of plot holes this causes, where Sailor Moon's daughter, from 1000 years in the future (which makes no sense at all, even after their explanations), travels back in time to save her world. She's still like a 7 year old, by the way. It only gets worse from there. And, keep in mind, all this is presented in just about the worst way it could be.Thankfully, if you manage to stomach these first two seasons, there is a silver lining. The third season is directed by someone new, who actually knows what they are doing, and it's a night and day difference. So if you happen to manage until then, you'll see almost all these problems thoroughly addressed there (other than some of the plot issues). I just wouldn't at all recommend doing so vs. watching the original or watching better magical girl anime. often cause major confusion due to a lack of narrative through-line and poor conveyence of information.

In the first few episodes, it wasn\'t that bad, so I thought to myself, ""It will probably get better, just keep watching."" It didn\'t get better, in fact, it got worse. I had to force myself to continue, and at 15 out of 26 episodes, I had to stop.The CGI transformations made it seem less magical than it should and also made them hard to watch. I found myself skipping the transformations because it was painful to see. And the animation, sigh. Fight scenes were so bland,...they didn\'t make you excited in the least. The animation was choppy and weird.Another thing that frustrated me were the Sailor Guards themselves. Especially Sailor Moon. I get that she is just a 14 year old girl, but come on, she\'s so useless and annoying. She\'s saved by Tuxedo Mask almost every fight. She comes into the fight all strong and confident, but the instant she realizes her opponent is powerful, she freaks out and begins to cry or try to run away, which then puts herself and the other Sailor Guards in danger, and Tuxedo Mask swoops in out of nowhere to help her. She\'s not inspiring at all. And the other Sailor Guards, they seem strong at first but can\'t hold their own in a fight. Even working together they\'re defeated pretty easily. Isn\'t this show about proving girls are strong? They didn\'t seem very strong. Especially when fighting their ""past lovers"" (who were guys), they were defeated so quickly.Another problem was the romance. It happened so fast. Maybe I\'m biased because I\'m a fan of slow-burn, but I still think it happened quickly. One episode Mamoru Chiba (Tuxedo Mask) thought Usagi Tsukino (Sailor Moon) was interesting, and the next he was kissing her. That doesn\'t seem to be the most important part of the show but it was still frustrating.All in all, this show was annoying and bland.

The artwork certainly looks better than the original series that aired back in the 1990s but at the same time there\'s very little animation. Most of it is saved for the transformation sequences. The sequences don\'t have the same magic as the originals.The opening theme song is also kind of laughable as it has some silly line about ""we don\'t need men."" That\'s both false and silly. Tuxedo Mask shows up and actually helps Sailor Moon out several times in both seasons. This is in contrast to the original series where I think...in Sailor Moon R I think the studio made it a running gag that Tuxedo Mask would show up, spout some inspirational stuff to Sailor Moon and then get immediately beat down by whatever monster of the week they were facing.This show is also bereft of any humor. This is serious business about Moon Princesses and love and justice and friendship. Actually no, scratch that. It is pretty comical that Sailor Venus uses anal beads as a weapon.There\'s also issues with the subtitles where in a few instances it comes across as incomprehensible garbage. This wasn\'t an issue as I was watching the English Dub after picking it back up. If I had been watching with Japanese audio though, in a few places I\'d have been like, ""huh?"" There\'s also a few descriptors on actions in the subtitles that are just like, da fuq? I think the most lulzworthy was the [affirmative grunt]. What? Who the hell grunts at someone as an answer of yes?There\'s also some leaps of logic. I\'m not sure if it was present in the original series, but during the Sailor Moon R arc Neo King Endymion says something to the effect of, ""this isn\'t really me, my real body is lying unconscious in another room."" If he\'s unconscious, how is he speaking to anyone? I just wasn\'t able to get around that.I\'d suggest watching the original Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon R.

This adaptation, compared to the classic anime, leaves something to be desired in many aspects if we compare it, such as the inferiority and strangeness of the animation with the use of CGI, the rushed development in the presentation of the characters, and also, the lack of showing the day to day Sailors' day in relaxed situations, where their development and their friendship are somewhat lost, making them more distant from the public. These are the negative points that I...found with this new adaptation, however, I also need to say that, in a way, it is somewhat unfair to compare both titles, since I would not like to see a copy of the classic anime, but the possibility of know the manga adaptation, and that's what we were given. I enjoyed having the opportunity to watch the manga adaptation, here there was more focus on the objective of the work, making the atmosphere more serious and focused, with significant battles and a good narrative of the story, which was very positive.REVIEW EM PORTUGUÊS, BRASILAmo Sailor Moon, o anime clássico é uma obra de arte, com uma animação delicada, cenas divertidíssimas, e história, romance e drama cativantes.

I loved it, and I genuinely enjoyed the characters. But Crystal has made me dislike the character of Usagi, as well as find her fairly useless. It\'s just the same cycle over and over. Sailor Moon cries, senshi protect her, senshi lose energy and collapse, Sailor Moon cries, they stand up repowered or she ""remembers the power of friendship and gets re-energized herself"". There\'s no variation to it. In addition, the 90s\'...anime gave me an emotional gut punch. The only time I felt emotional watching this was during the initial nostalgia factor of meeting the senshi over the first few episodes. In the 90s\' anime, she was childish, but endearing. Here... she\'s lost the endearing quality.Animation? Terrible. SM is a powerhouse of a classic, and it deserved better. The CG is horrible. Don\'t get me wrong, I am not against CG, but do it well if you are going to do it. The drawn animation was also done incredibly poorly. The people who made this should be ashamed of taking something so legendary and stomping it into the mud. It should have been handled with the respect and care it deserves.Voice acting was mostly okay, with the exception of the ""big bad"" in Season 1. The lines were delivered like a petulant child. In regards to the dialogues themselves, they were poorly done. They feel clunky and unnatural. They needed serious rewriting to make them flow better in this media.If you loved the 90s\' anime and want something SM related, I recommend the live action series. It starts off a little clunky, but get good at around episode 8, and the acting improves a lot. It also delivers some good emotional gut punches that Crystal can\'t pull off. anime gave me an emotional gut punch.

I love the classic anime and the manga, I tried to get into Crystal when it came out, but unfortunately it was just awful. And while by time, it noticably become better at the later arcs, even if I try to just view it as a different iteration, it maybe can considered as a good adaptation, but IMHO not as a good anime.The problem is not what Crystal is trying to do, but how it does. Their main hook was being a more loyal adaptation to the manga, but being a good adaptation and being...a good anime is two different thing. Their aim really was, more or less, to bring the story of the manga to an anime as straight as possible, but their lack of vision caused that they missed the most important behind it, it's heart and soul.Lets face it, if a show can't convince an audience, at the most critical time, AKA around the first 5 episodes that it's worthwhile. Especially in a case like this when we had high hopes and expectations towards the show, then that show is doomed. Or at least have a very hard time to be considered as a success. People will turn their backs, leave with a sour taste in their mouth, and that's exactly what happened with Crystal.The 90s anime fans were unimpressed with the barebones storyline, the super fast pacing, and the simple characterization. While the manga fans felt Crystal didn't treat the source material with the reverence it deserved.They promised us a remake for the 20th anniversary, which would be faithful to the original manga. Both were lies. The release date has been pushed back several times, and when it finally came out, after 2 years later when it origninally suppose to be, it felt like the product was half-assed and dated at the same time. It also turned out very quickly, while Crystal mostly stick to the manga, it also have changes, which just cause more confusion.<b>Animation and art style</b>: Personally I hated the new color scheme, the noodle limbs, and in general the many floating, flying scenes. It just looks ridiculous, like they have rubber bodies, and the whole place have lunar gravity. They tried to reflect Naoko's art, but they messed up. The manga art style is good on paper, like looking at a fashion illustration, but it hard to translate on screen, because it requires movement. Ironically, the '90s anime was closer to that style than what they did in Crystal.Quality wise, Sailor Moon in fact never was a high quality anime. The '90s anime have a lot of static things in the background, and some of those even looked pretty rough. However, at least it was a consistent quality, and that anime still have it's own unique and appealing art style. In the 90s anime, they made creative and bold design decisions, like the architect of the Dark Kingdom and Planet Nemesis was astonishing. It was eldritch, alien looking, with strange, abstract forms and weird powers. Compared to that, these places in Crystal just looks simple and barren.The animation quality in Crystal is pretty inconsistent. A scene can look really nice and detailed, while another can look poorly designed, cheap and low effort. Not the mention the many, many animation errors, like bad perpectives, choppy animations, sudden quality drops, etc.The transformation and attack sequences were also a huge disappointment, even after they abandoned the awful, fake 3D looking CGI. In the 90s anime these scenes are memorable and aged well, because looks beautiful and detailed, and have awesome, catchy music. Compared to those, the ones in Crystal are lazy, cheap, and uninspired. (Dead black backgrounds.)Also, this is just a minor annoyance compared to the previously mentioned, but the presence of modern technology like laptops, smartphones, and LCD screens are also ruined the atmosphere. The show should represent the 1990s, when it was originally written. Imagine if we got a new RoboCop, which have modern technology, instead of that authentic 80s retrofuturism. (Oh wait, that already happened, and people hated it.)<b>Story, pacing, characterization</b>: The 90’s anime and the manga are radically different from each other, despite and because of being produced alongside each other. The 90’s anime rather than being a straight adaptation, it basically only adapting the arc ideas over the actual executed manga arcs. Crystal is instead a straight forward adaptation of the manga, with very little in the way of changes or expansion. This however more of a curse than a bless, mostly because the Manga’s fast pacing does not translate well to animation.Manga fans like to deny this, but the manga also have it's own fair share of flaws. The story is deficient and illogical in many ways, and the 90s anime fixed much of what was wrong with the manga. Like minimalistic personalities for the inners, villains dying after one panel, things happening out of the blue, etc. Crystal had an opportunity to make up for the manga’s flaws but they left the worst parts be, and the changes can considered rather forced and poorly executed.The 90s anime, much like many mainstream anime of its time is notorious of having many filler episodes. However, fillers also have their own function, by giving the story adequate time to unravel, while also including fun slice of life parts, mixed with action packed monster of a week parts. Which allowed the characters, both senshis and villains to be more fleshed out.The manga already focuses on Usagi to the point that the others, especially the Inners don't get many opportunities to shine, and Crystal just takes away from what little they do have. The Inner Senshi stop having any impact or meaningful effect over the events, and they have no real connection to the main plot either. They're just kind of there, occasionally acting as a sort of support characters. For all the flaws of the classic anime, I prefer it for the time it spends characterizing all of the girls into a true ensemble cast with Usagi at its heart.<b>Overall</b>: Dark Kingdom and Black Moon arc was a mess. Both suffered from the same hideous designs, weird mistakes, and idiotic changes. Infinity had better production values than Black Moon but still suffered from bad direction and finding its own identity. Eternal was mostly fine. The direction was better than Infinity but the 1:1 adaptation format didn't work in movie format. The animation was nice and going for designs that emulate the original anime was a good move.As a whole Crystal is okay. It starts off horribly and gradually gets better, but unlike the original it never becomes anything remarkable, or memorable. It just mediocre. It can't be called as a worthy sucessor of the original anime, or the faithful adaptation of the original manga. Which brings up the question, what is the point of Crystal? Because the only thing it successfully achieved over 10 years, is it become a disappointment for those who were (and maybe still) fans of the original.

The well-paced nature of the story, one of the biggest drawbacks of the OG sailor moon anime, has finally been addressed. This almost makes Sailor Moon Crystal the definitive animation for the two arcs of the manga it covers.However, Sailor Moon Crystal goes almost too far in its pacing. As a result...of its quickened pace, the other sailor scouts lack a lot of the same character and charm that the original sailor scouts had.The other big drawback to Sailor Moon Crystal is its wonky animation choices. It is clear that the animators wanted to harken back to the original designs of the manga characters, but you'll find yourself wishing the 90s animators worked on this instead. The CGI transformation sequences are alien and out of place. The movements of the scouts feel more barbie doll and less... well cartoonish.  The animation is possibly the most offensive part of this series.While the questionable animation choices, bad CGI and neglected sailor ancillary scouts keep this from being the definitive way to enjoy sailor moon; the much better pacing and the far more competent season 3 still makes this the recommended way to pick up sailor moon for anyone new to the franchise. For that, it gets just a 6/10. of its quickened pace, the other sailor scouts lack a lot of the same character and charm that the original sailor scouts had.The other big drawback to Sailor Moon Crystal is its wonky animation choices.

I never read the manga so I don\'t know. It\'s also great watching a group of girls be heroic without being objectified. The emotional rollercoaster that is Usagi\'s and Sailor Moon\'s life is touching and reminds us that the burden of saving the world shouldn\'t fall onto junior high school students. The transformation sequences alone make this one of the prettiest animes one could watch. also there\'s the nostalgia factor taking me back to my childhood (how old was I when I...watched those english dubs?) learning there\'s more to anime than mecha and kamehameha. Nostalgia aside I don\'t think this review will be too favorable.First issue is the inconsistent art. I understand there\'s a nostalgic look and feel to this anime but it seems they purposely put errors and mistakes in as easter eggs of an era I hoped had passed. Like the transformation scenes cost too much and they had to cut corners to save money. My next issue is summed up in a question [b]""Is Sailor Mars in this series?""[/b]. Now I know she is but the point is the Sailor Scouts do very little other than explain the situations to Usagi and the viewer. But then I ask why bother having them in it at all? They contribute nothing to the end and are seemingly powerless in the face of every enemy. At least Orihime (Bleach) contributed by healing.Another complaint that I use a lot these days is pacing. Two arcs over 26 episodes, this needed to be shorter (they spend a whole episode watching Usagi cry until they decide to go to the moon) or longer so they could flesh out these characters. I mean what do we know about Sailor Venus? There\'s too many characters for this little to be going on; and when something is going on only Sailor Moon is of any use.I tried to give this a four but by episode 20 it just seemed really long and dragged out.

The character shows no steady development in there personality or story background. When introduce to the character you are given a brief information but no visual storytelling behind it making the characters seem bland.The story line is rushed from the very begin, which loses the main details of the series.Although the animation style is an somewhat improvement I believe they have left many details that could have help in some aspect of the series.I...am most disappointed in some areas of the series where the most important details are flushed out or been overwrite with other things, (there were many that made me mad).Overall my opinion of this series is that is cringe worthy as it looks as if the writer wrote their own crappy version of the original sailor moon. am most disappointed in some areas of the series where the most important details are flushed out or been overwrite with other things, (there were many that made me mad).Overall my opinion of this series is that is cringe worthy as it looks as if the writer wrote their own crappy version of the original sailor moon."", ""I remember almost nothing that happened in this anime, and I've both seen much of the original series And read some of the manga.

But even if the art were good, the story isn't really there. There's none of the heart that the original had.

This series is so trope heavy that my friends and I had a long running joke that revolved around us making the most cliché predictions and then laughing or pointing the slight difference out sarcastically when they appeared. This show is not directed at my age range and I didn't expect it to be. However, I wish I could say that I would've enjoyed it when I was younger. There are two things that prevented me from doing so. (1) In the second half of the season the animation tanks....Another long running joke became pointing out at which points it was clear that the animators had run out of budget. (2) Usagi is a horrible main character. Besides the whole issue with the ideas of characters being born into power rather than working hard for it, Usagi herself doesn't have any character growth. Her only superpower is crying so loudly it causes sound waves. This is not empowering to young girls (which I assume the show is aimed at). Besides that, the plot is a pretty typical young girls band together and save the world from bad guys.  Another long running joke was that Usagi was more in love with the other sailor guardians than Tuxedo Mask, so I recommend thinking about that for some fun Sapphic undertones for older viewers.

This is my first time leaving a review for anything and going back through my list, decided to give this one a whirl since at the time, I was truly looking forward to it.When finding out that they were going to do another adaptation of the series, I was very hopeful. I was looking forward to certain aspects that the original series left out, like the Shittenou and the Asteroid Senshi, for instance.  Maybe we could get a better adaptation of SuperS or maybe Saturn will be utilized more properly in this version. Unfortunately, I couldn't get...through the series far enough to fully see how these storylines were handled.As for why I could not get through this series...mainly the characters themselves. They come across as terribly bland in comparison to the original anime. I do know that this is a manga adaptation and how it is closer to the manga, which I did like, but this is a situation where Sailor Moon benefits from having filler. The characters could be fleshed out more, which in part, helped the audience to become attached to the characters. It really *does* feel like Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Kamen, and the rest.  In the original, it was nice seeing the characters doing activities that normal kids their age would be doing anyway, showing they had lives away from Sailor Business...and I think that was the main problem with Crystal...it was mostly Sailor Business. It made the senshi boring and like their only purpose in life was to just be soldiers.The more boring aspects of the manga had to be used in the newer series and I get it, but for a person like me who never particularly cared for it, it was draining.  I liked the original for focusing on the friendship aspect between our main characters as opposed to the romance angle. It gives me Miaka and Tamahome vibes from Fushigi Yuugi's anime. It's like everyone else didn't matter to Miaka, including Yui, and it was always Tamahome, Tamahome, Tamahome to her.  I also know that they adapted the Beryll/Metallia battle closer...and there's something from that situation that I hated when reading the manga. I liked the change the original used...but that's just me being nitpicky.The story pacing wasn't very good with this. Too fast-paced, which I do understand since it's adapting the manga more closely since the manga is already completed.  Since they're only focusing on the Sailor Business stuff, like the manga mostly would (minus the extra stuff that I actually would've liked to have seen adapted), that's no surprise, but I like character building and world building. As mentioned above, because of this approach, none of the characters come across as interesting.I didn't like the animation style, but I will admit that from the bit I've seen with later episodes (clips), the animation seems a bit better. The animation, though, still comes across as too glamorous and flashy to me...like they are trying to make the characters perfect. Also, to me, the manga style just doesn't work in an anime style. The animation was also a bit stiff and the characters didn't emote hardly at all.  This is another plus for the original series. The characters were very expressive and they didn't look disproportioned.  The only things I will admit to liking animation wise, is the background for their henshin sequences showing their planets and the designs of their sailor fuku.  They actually got the designs right and this was probably because they could use CG as opposed to the hand-drawn animation of the original where it would be more of a hassle to have to keep redrawing every character's outfit differently for each episode.As for music...it wasn't very memorable for me. The intro and ending was...so-so and the bgm didn't stick with me like the original series. This may just be bias on my part, but Moonlight Densetsu will always be Sailor Moon to me.Maybe someday I will go back to this series and hopefully the issues I had with it, which turned me off from it, will have been resolved. I really really really wanted to like this. I went to the Sailor Moon Cafe in Ikebukuro when Crystal was being promoted. I went to Sky Tree when all that Sailor Moon stuff was being promo'd along with other works that were originally in the magazine Sailor Moon ran in. It's been about four years now for me since I gave up on Crystal and it's really sad. through the series far enough to fully see how these storylines were handled.As for why I could not get through this series...mainly the characters themselves. They come across as terribly bland in comparison to the original anime. I do know that this is a manga adaptation and how it is closer to the manga, which I did like, but this is a situation where Sailor Moon benefits from having filler. The characters could be fleshed out more, which in part, helped the audience to become attached to the characters. It really *does* feel like Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Kamen, and the rest.

Gaiking: Legend of Daiku-Maryu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1845/Gaiking__Legend_of_Daiku-Maryu,"[""The remake of the classic Gaiking generally stays true to the general aesthetic of classic Super Robot shows of the 70's. But there are subtle changes. The evil villains are not always so evil, and the heroes are never invincible; a simple final move away from winning the match. Like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann after it, Gaiking successfully homages and parodies the super robot shows of the past, while creating its own unique flavor to make in the end, an incredibly satisfying watching experience.The music is evocative; an outstanding vocal theme kicking in as the heroes turn the situation in their favor, and the voice...actress of lead character Daiya is emotional, intense, and enthralling; as is the voice work of almost everyone else in the show. The artwork is a mixed back - while the character artwork sometimes goes between the outstanding and the generic anime look, the mechanical artwork for Gaiking and the rest of the mecha on screen is nine out of ten times absolutely gorgeous and action packed.This show is a modern super robot classic, and any fan of the genre shouldn't miss it. actress of lead character Daiya is emotional, intense, and enthralling; as is the voice work of almost everyone else in the show.

The robot designs are fairly ""retro"" in appearance, which isn’t overly surprising as this is a ""re-imagining"" of an earlier anime series (one which you don’t need to be familiar with). The animation is fluid and the plot development, while not amazing, is certainly a cut above...average with some nice twists and a fairly interesting setting explanation (I found it particularly interesting as it would be eminently thieveable for an rpg setting). It also avoids some plot clichés which I find annoying, particularly the protagonist whingeing about having to kill - while it works in some contexts it often feels forced and so I’m glad Gaiking didn’t really bother it (as I don’t feel it fits).In terms of giant robot action Gaiking certainly delivers, nearly every episode a new weapon or combination or mecha is revealed and its all done in a very enjoyable fashion. In many ways I rate giant robot shows (and a lot of other things) by how many times they make you think ""Fuck yeah"" (or your affirmative phrase of choice) and Gaiking is packed with moments like this.Its intro is also worth a mention, Super-Robot shows tend to have cool (for certain values of cool) intro\'s with amazingly cheesey lyrics and a veritable symphony of hair rock, in fact I\'ve watched or purchased some shows based purely on the intro alone. Gaiking\'s intro is among the very best, while the song is catchy enough it’s the manner in which it ties into the intro animation that really sells it (it’s the island exploding, just does it for me). average with some nice twists and a fairly interesting setting explanation (I found it particularly interesting as it would be eminently thieveable for an rpg setting).

Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko,"['I don’t make it a point to write reviews, but I particularly enjoyed Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, and, upon seeing its subpar ratings, felt somewhat obligated to defend it, so, here goes:Art:Wonderful, wonderful artwork. I’m a stickler for art, having dropped numerous series simply because I couldn’t stand the way they were drawn, and Denpa Onna definitely wins in this category. Shaft has outdone itself – colorful, lively scenery, vibrant, multi-toned characters, and, in general, great color schemes, compositions, and dynamism in each frame. It’s not quite 5 cm/s, but I daresay it’s approaching that level.Soundtrack:I usually neglect this category, as I find it...to be a relatively minor component to my viewing experience. However, Denpa Onna does provide some melancholic piano keys and nice ambience music that complement the pacing well. Can’t say I’m a fan of the OP or ED, but, then again, I was never into the high-pitched squeals that permeate much of anime JPop.Characters:As many reviewers iterated before me, eccentricities abound in this motley crew of a cast. Honestly, it’s refreshing to see a show invent new personalities instead of rehashing the standard anime prototypes. (I especially enjoyed how Erio Touwa [E.T.] sat in Makoto’s bicycle basket as he pedaled her into the sky). Development is admittedly slow, but it’s definitely there. This is something I feel many reviewers don’t emphasize enough. Denpa Onna is a show about the gentle adolescence of our halcyon days, and, to that end, I think it’s nice that events and developments aren’t explosive or convoluted. The subtleties and gradual changes are meant to mirror the normalcy of our teenage years and, thus, offer a stark but welcome contrast to the eccentric personalities – that is, while the characters are themselves bizarre, their growth is relatable and meaningful.Story:Denpa Onna opened with an explosive start. Bracketing the rest of the show, I think the first 3 episodes could operate as a short, standalone OVA series. Really, I was hooked after watching a prologue so rife with meaning and mystery. Erio’s personality is fully emphasized here, and here, too, is where the show probes most philosophically at the deeper themes of life. Makoto’s rejection of Erio’s delusions is a deeper rejection of ontological relativism as a legitimate means to happiness – his actions nuance his convictions well, and we really get a sense of Makoto’s take on what it means to be human.Sadly, I feel many casual viewers gloss over this last point and take Denpa Onna to be yet another mindless harem. Let me emphasize that it is not. Its insight is subtle, but present, and acutely profound.So, what about the rest of the show, you ask? Well I can say that the first three episodes are somewhat anomalous when compared to the slow pace and slice-of-life themed events of the last 9 episodes. Critics charge that Denpa Onna lacks plot or hooks to keep viewers interested, and I’m not unsympathetic to this criticism. However, as mentioned above, I think the slow pacing works well with what this show takes itself to be: a chronicle of a boy’s adolescence. I find it far more realistic that schoolgirl crushes don’t blow up into soap operas and baseball games don’t become matters of life and death. Don’t get me wrong; it’s not like the series never scratches below the surface – it really does, but, often, it does so almost imperceptibly. Take episode 8 (Tsiolkovsky’s Prayer), for example. It centers around Meme’s daily routine over a week, but the conclusion of the episode is nothing short of powerful, poignant, and profound, letting us really glimpse the depth beneath her skin. People are unique, change slowly, and offer interesting and poignant stories.  This, I think Denpa Onna emphasizes very profoundly.Moreover, among these events of every day life are the rare gemstones that move boys closer to manhood, and Denpa Onna doesn’t forget this. Conversations with characters often revolve around mundane occurrences like deep sea fish or basketball games, but are artfully and subtly infused with lessons on the importance of curiosity or the rate of human progress. It’s important, when watching, to pay attention to these moments – as they offer enlightening insight into the human experience.So, what’s the final verdict on Denpa Onna?If you’re looking for something explosive, convoluted, and plot-driven, then I advise you to turn away. If, however, you’re looking for something light-hearted yet penetrating, then I urge you to pick this up. By the end of it, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, with its subtle but philosophical messages, really offers you a novel and reflective outlook on that awkward phase between puberty and responsibility.

And,  after all, that’s how life is: subtle but profound.', 'This review exists within the internet, authored by a SHAFT fanboi.It functions only as a test ground for me. It is also a spoiler zone in this page.Under the current assessment of the series, it is a ""9/10"".This was determined by my reaction to audio-visual investigation of the SHAFT seishun anime.Patience is the closest thing viewers have to salvation.However, accelerated exposure could amplify the viewing experience of a class-2 audience.A collective of readers that has forgotten it is a collective of voters... That is you.Members of the self-unaware, clueless MAL users under aliases are not permitted to vote ""Not Helpful"" on this review.Injection of corrective...program to opinionated haters with inflated pessimism and distaste!I would write the entire review in Denpanese, but I used up my esper mana for speaking an alien language.The word ""denpa"" (lit. ""electromagnetic waves"") is used to refer to people with overly-active imaginations who appear to live in their own world. In other words, delusional psychopaths.The word ""seishun"" (lit. ""blue spring"") means ""adolescent"" or ""puberty"". However, the term often implies the joys and challenges of overcoming immaturity, and youthful romance, as per usage in ""seishun points"".\'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\'(loosely translated to ""Psychopathic Girl and Adolescent Boy"") begins with the the protagonist Niwa Makoto moving into a new city, known as the ""the City Watched Over by Aliens"". He\'s in his aunt Meme\'s care, whose daughter Erio is a denpa hikikomori wrapped in futon.The story begins with Makoto getting to know Erio. She\'s got a serious case of denpa, believing herself to be an alien who came to Earth to investigate the mankind. Being a nice guy that he is, Makoto takes her out to prove she\'s a human being and can\'t fly like E.T. After that, the focus is transferred to the remaining cast, Mifune ""Ryuushi-san"" Ryuuko, Maekawa-san, and Hoshimiya Yashiro.Many viewers must have felt betrayed when Erio turned from a jargon-spitting enigmatic girl in a futon to an ordinary shy girl, but ironically, Makoto and Erio are surrounded by denpa and therefore has plenty of material for comedy and accumulation of Seishun Points.Niwa Makoto is your average protagonist in a harem setup. He even describes his own situation as a typical protagonist in school drama in the first episode. However, he does have his own unique Seishun Point system to keep track of the quality of his school life, and does actively pursue opportunities to accumulate points. He is one of the more likable protagonist around in that he has a skeptic, realistic personality, but man up when it really counts. He has a pretty good sense of humor, and we as viewers follow his narration as a guide, seeing things through his perspective almost the entire time.Touwa Erio started out as a hopeless loner whose own mother had given up on her for becoming denpa after a traumatizing event in her childhood. She does eventually get ""fixed"" by Makoto, and makes a slow return into the society. Her character provided early selling point for the series, and we see her gradual change after Makoto showed up. This season ended at volume 3 of the novel series, out of 8 volumes in total. Her change in character was limited to finding a part-time job and participating group events, but there is surely more to come if a sequel is ever made.Touwa Meme is a 40-year old aunt of Makoto, who acts like a child all the time and sputters nonsense all the time. Her role in this series is mainly MILF moe and acting as a puppet-master who influences the other main characters to get the story going. She\'s quite mysterious, and it\'s hard to know what she\'s thinking, but as audiences, we know she\'s hiding something about Elliott, who may or may not be an alien.Ryuushi-san is probably the most interesting character in this series. She is a moeblob, but has an unique and consistent quirkiness that worked really well with Makoto. Their chemistry is excellent, and she\'s just one of those adorably cute hard working character that you can\'t help but cheer for. She is the de facto Heroine in this season, spending most time with Makoto and the only one to actively try to win him over like a character in a true seishun series. Yashiro\'s line in ep11 makes me wonder if they would eventually become an item. The way she blushes around Makoto was really cute, and I\'ll certainly be cheering for her.Maekawa-san\'s personality is almost the opposite of Ryuushi-san. She\'s always composed and has a dark sense of humor, also seems to have analyzed every situtation and knows what\'s going on. However, she also seems to have a screw loose on her head, with all the strange cosplays shown in every episode. Her role in the show is mainly to tease Makoto and Ryuushi-san, but getting them together conflicts with her apparent feelings for Makoto. There could be some major character development for her if the sequel is ever made. And of course, her costumes are also there for moe to niche viewers.Hoshimiya Yashiro made a very late appearance this season, but left a huge impact into the story. She claims to be an alien esper, which no one believes, but she has shown evidence of her super powers throughout the final few episodes. Interestingly, she says Makoto and Ryuushi both have ""the potential"", which was precisely what Erio said to Makoto early in the show when she was still a major denpa. Yashiro also brings a new theme to the show, that one should not limit their potential, and develop the strength to believe. This message is extremely similar to \'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin\', but it is executed far better here, with many great inspirational scenes.Every major characters have their roles in the show, and the character headcount is very low to ensure every character gets their own spotlight. There were some pacing problems in the middle as one non-linear episode mixed in and extremely slow story development, but there are incredibly inspiring and touching moments of youth in every episode as a treat. There are also plenty of references to other manga and anime, sometimes even real life events to keep us entertained.Art and animation is this series is generally very good. The character designs are attractive, with great cuts and camera angles (although it\'s almost completely devoid of the signature SHAFT animation style). There are few scenes where characters seemed deformed for budget saving purposes, possibly using Korean animators, but every single inspiring scene (and fan service scene) that actually matters is drawn to perfection. SHAFT knows how to inspire and how to best use visual support to tell a story, and it shows once again in this series.Voice acting, with exception of Erio, is spectacular. Ryuushi-san\'s voice acting is what I would call 「ハマリ役」, epic casting. Her voice is so unique, yet fits the character perfectly. All the seiyuu staff in this series are extremely motivated, and their lines are filled with emotion, especially in the most critical lines.BGM is also incredibly touching and flows extremely well. It kind of just plays in the background, but becomes really noticeable in critical scenes to improve the viewing experience... it\'s in total harmony with the story.OP is a ""denpa song"" in a whole different way. The term is usually used to describe songs with incomprehensible lyrics. In this case, the lyrics do make sense, but BGM composition and the vocal sound absolutely retarded. This works extremely well for a series about denpa, and it\'s somehow addicting. Absolutely brilliant.ED is rather dull, but cute song with fun lyrics and unique whisper vocals.\'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\' has many classic, almost cliché seishun elements, such as screaming out corny lines in public, running towards the sun (its variation biking towards the moon was used), awkward silences between the opposite sex, working hard on sports... However, it\'s the execution that makes all the difference, and it really shows in this series. The main message of keeping our minds open and appreciate every moment of our lives, it really reached my heart.This series has also given me a new level of appreciation for NisiOisiN\'s works. Although the series does attempt to use witty dialogs to advance the story and succeeded to some degree, it lacks the pacing and sophistication seen in similar NisiOisiN adaptations by SHAFT, \'Bakemonogatari\' and \'Katanagatari\'. If I had to pick, this is closest to \'Soredemo Machi wa Mawatte Iru\' for being a rare authentic \'slice-of-life\' anime, and also the extreme quirkiness that\'s hit-or-miss for its viewers. It was a definite hit for me, and I\'ll definitely look forward to the sequel.\'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\' is a story full of dreams and depicts an ordinary guy in a crazy city, trying living his life to the fullest. It\'s brilliant, and exactly what a true seishun series is all about. If you disagree, I guess I\'ll just say it out loud in a clear and concise phrase...""If you say so."" program to opinionated haters with inflated pessimism and distaste!I would write the entire review in Denpanese, but I used up my esper mana for speaking an alien language.The word ""denpa"" (lit.

She is a moeblob, but has an unique and consistent quirkiness that worked really well with Makoto. Their chemistry is excellent, and she\'s just one of those adorably cute hard working character that you can\'t help but cheer for. She is the de facto Heroine in this season, spending most time with Makoto and the only one to actively try to win him over like a character in a true seishun series. Yashiro\'s line in ep11 makes me wonder if they would eventually become an item. The way she blushes around Makoto was really cute, and I\'ll certainly be cheering for her.Maekawa-san\'s personality is almost the opposite of Ryuushi-san. She\'s always composed and has a dark sense of humor, also seems to have analyzed every situtation and knows what\'s going on. However, she also seems to have a screw loose on her head, with all the strange cosplays shown in every episode. Her role in the show is mainly to tease Makoto and Ryuushi-san, but getting them together conflicts with her apparent feelings for Makoto. There could be some major character development for her if the sequel is ever made. And of course, her costumes are also there for moe to niche viewers.Hoshimiya Yashiro made a very late appearance this season, but left a huge impact into the story. She claims to be an alien esper, which no one believes, but she has shown evidence of her super powers throughout the final few episodes. Interestingly, she says Makoto and Ryuushi both have ""the potential"", which was precisely what Erio said to Makoto early in the show when she was still a major denpa. Yashiro also brings a new theme to the show, that one should not limit their potential, and develop the strength to believe. This message is extremely similar to \'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin\', but it is executed far better here, with many great inspirational scenes.Every major characters have their roles in the show, and the character headcount is very low to ensure every character gets their own spotlight. There were some pacing problems in the middle as one non-linear episode mixed in and extremely slow story development, but there are incredibly inspiring and touching moments of youth in every episode as a treat. There are also plenty of references to other manga and anime, sometimes even real life events to keep us entertained.Art and animation is this series is generally very good. The character designs are attractive, with great cuts and camera angles (although it\'s almost completely devoid of the signature SHAFT animation style). There are few scenes where characters seemed deformed for budget saving purposes, possibly using Korean animators, but every single inspiring scene (and fan service scene) that actually matters is drawn to perfection. SHAFT knows how to inspire and how to best use visual support to tell a story, and it shows once again in this series.Voice acting, with exception of Erio, is spectacular. Ryuushi-san\'s voice acting is what I would call 「ハマリ役」, epic casting. Her voice is so unique, yet fits the character perfectly. All the seiyuu staff in this series are extremely motivated, and their lines are filled with emotion, especially in the most critical lines.BGM is also incredibly touching and flows extremely well. It kind of just plays in the background, but becomes really noticeable in critical scenes to improve the viewing experience... it\'s in total harmony with the story.OP is a ""denpa song"" in a whole different way. The term is usually used to describe songs with incomprehensible lyrics. In this case, the lyrics do make sense, but BGM composition and the vocal sound absolutely retarded. This works extremely well for a series about denpa, and it\'s somehow addicting. Absolutely brilliant.ED is rather dull, but cute song with fun lyrics and unique whisper vocals.\'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\' has many classic, almost cliché seishun elements, such as screaming out corny lines in public, running towards the sun (its variation biking towards the moon was used), awkward silences between the opposite sex, working hard on sports... However, it\'s the execution that makes all the difference, and it really shows in this series. The main message of keeping our minds open and appreciate every moment of our lives, it really reached my heart.This series has also given me a new level of appreciation for NisiOisiN\'s works. Although the series does attempt to use witty dialogs to advance the story and succeeded to some degree, it lacks the pacing and sophistication seen in similar NisiOisiN adaptations by SHAFT, \'Bakemonogatari\' and \'Katanagatari\'. If I had to pick, this is closest to \'Soredemo Machi wa Mawatte Iru\' for being a rare authentic \'slice-of-life\' anime, and also the extreme quirkiness that\'s hit-or-miss for its viewers. It was a definite hit for me, and I\'ll definitely look forward to the sequel.\'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\' is a story full of dreams and depicts an ordinary guy in a crazy city, trying living his life to the fullest. It\'s brilliant, and exactly what a true seishun series is all about. If you disagree, I guess I\'ll just say it out loud in a clear and concise phrase...""If you say so.""', 'Let\'s say you have a drinking problem. Instead of admitting that you have a problem, you blame your drinking because your wife nags at you, or because the devil told you to do it, or some other excuse I could not think of because I do not have drinking problem.

No I do not have a blue hair fetish) She plays the electromagnetic wave woman in this series (electromagnetic wave woman here means weird, crazy or someone who has an obsessive behavior on an perception) She provides the story for the first arc in the series, Makoto helping her cope from her transition from an \'extraterrestrial being\' back to a \'normal\' human being.She is also the main example of a person who is clearly distorting her own reality.But she may not be in denial?

Racist pricks.', 'A really casual one, it was a totally random choice, but I don\'t regret it though. So what\'s it about? It may not have an incredible climax and everything... Instead, this anime focuses more upon reflection. It\'s simple:  just take a teenager who wants to enjoy his high school years to the max and add an odd girl to whom he begins devoting his time, in order to get her back to real life.Makoto\'s first time in a big city made him create big expectations about how his life would be from now on. He wanted to meet girls, spend time with them and...even maybe fall in love, afterall, that\'s what being an young boy is all about. Meeting Erio was the first step from this new journey.

Making her forget all this ""alien stuff"" and the past she couldn\'t remember, trying to get her to be more sociable and stop hiding from everyone... This also affects Makoto, as he gets more self-confident.Art impressed me... Glowing style, slow-mo scenes and fluid animation, despite not having much action, overally amazing! I think OP theme could\'ve been better and the ED song is so sweet and calm... Characters have nothing really special in particular. Most of them are ordinary people with different personalities. Both Ryuko\'s and Erio\'s shyness attracted me... Besides that, they\'re so cute and lovely! Also, voices chosen for both of them match perfectly!Never give up and believing in yourself, just two of the many lessons we can learn from this anime...

That\'s so deep...', 'A problem that a show with interesting premise or quirks can run into is getting far too wrapped up in itself. A show can become contrived, focusing on playing around with its quirkiness; forgetting that there is a story to be told. Such is the case with Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, a charmingly eccentric show that ultimately gets deflated by the eccentricities that made it appealing to begin with.Denpa Onna is a bizarre show, to say the very least. It centers around Makoto Niwa, a somewhat sarcastic young man who goes to live with his aunt Meme; having certain expectations of his new life....Expectations that are shattered after meeting his impishly flirtatious aunt and beyond bizarre cousin Erio,who claims to be an alien and wraps herself in a futon. He later meets a cheerful and clumsy girl named Ryuko (or better known as Ryushi, to her irritation), and the resident cosplay character, Maekawa. While this sounds like your standard cast for a slice-of-life anime, rest assured, the cast is eccentric enough to stand out from the crowd. Every character has their weird quirks and talk in a way no normal person would. Erio in particular is a winsome odd-ball, a hikikomori who uses the guise of being an alien as a shield from her insecurities; and Maekawa existence seems to be poking fun at use of pun humor in anime. The off-beat way these characters behave and interact with one another is what gives the show its unique flavor.The show puts its eccentric characters and rambling dialogue to good use. Pretty much every conversation between characters has an entirely different meaning than its face value. A conversation about aliens can actually be an exchange of worldviews; one about ESP can actually be about peoples\' hidden potential. This makes the exceedingly strange exchanges between characters meaningful, rather than just nonsensical ramblings. Just as interesting is seeing our dysfunctional recluse of a female lead, Erio, slowly warm up to her cousin. We see her change from being insanely introverted to a slightly more stable, though still fairly unsociable, weirdo. She even has a part-time job and joins an amateur baseball team by the shows finale, all the while retaining the charming weirdness that grabbed our attention in the beginning.So why does this show fall short, well... it doesn\'t really go anywhere. Sure, Erio progressively becomes more active in the world around her, but as for everyone else progress is near non-existent. Even as Makoto gets to know Maekawa and his aunt Meme better, their relationships remain static through the entire series.This is even true for Ryuko, who has a big crush on Makoto. You think with all the talking in the show these relationships would develop nicely, but instead the characters spend most of the time talking around each other and dodging pressing matters. When they aren\'t in convoluted conversation or monologue, the characters are usually engaged with some trivial activity that is entertaining enough to watch but pointless in the grand scheme of things. Not to say these aspects of the show are not enjoyable, but they do get tedious to watch as the show continues on its merry way to nowhere.The show\'s visuals are pretty solid, though nothing to write home about, really. The scenery is pretty much what you would expect from a slice-of-life, nothing breathtaking, but it gets the job done. As for the character designs, most attention goes to the female cast (of course), which is the visual highlight of the show. Erio is gorgeous, likely the best looking leading lady of 2011, and mother Meme; rival for Makoto\'s attention, Ryuko; cosplaying Maekawa; and late arrival Yashiro are just as pretty. The rest of the cast is more average looking, but pleasant on the eyes nonetheless.  The music is also pretty typical of slice-of-life (except for the bizarre opening and oddly cute ending themes). It pleasantly floats around supporting the shows atmosphere, though can also build up excitement when called to do so, like in the ""I can\'t fly"" scene, which is the the shows most striking moment.In the end, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is a generally pleasant experience. Its strange, off-kilter tone and characters definitely sets it apart from regular slice-of-life anime. Plus, Erio is the cutest basket-case you are likely to find. It is a shame the story doesn\'t really progress, getting caught up in a web of convoluted dialogue and all too quaint events. This is actually not a bad show, just a disappointing one.

However, I still love their artsy touch and the way they handle most dialogues that is much present in Denpa Onna. Yet, there’s something lacking in Denpa Onna to make it good and that is a focus. It’s a shame really, because this anime had such a great start. I find it sad that they had to ruin it in the second half.Based on a light novel, the story shares some similiraties with the Haruhi Suzumiya. Most notably, the two main characters,...which both have the same personality, are emerged in a world of bizarre situations. The difference is that Denpa Onna is completely voided of any supernatural element, even though it brings aliens and espers in the foreplay. Though the story could be considered as some sort of coming of age, it is never clear what it is really about. The big problem with Denpa Onna is how well it handles the many elements that it is given, for I must say, not well at all. While it does begin as a simple story of “saving the broken girl”, it doesn’t take time before the series loses its initial charm. For the second half, the anime turns around in a midst of pointless moments that can range from enjoyable to plain boring. Though, these pointless moments, are for the best, emotional. The results here shouldn’t be surprising. Denpa Onna concludes in a unsatisfying and completely out of place way that leaves you a bitter taste in the end. In other word, what it needs is a satisfying sequel with a much, much better direction.Knowing Shaft, it is not surprising that Denpa Onna shares a good amount of mentally ill characters. For new comers, this might be a refreshing outcome since they act mostly in an extravagant way. For the Shaft followers or other anime connoisseurs, it is nothing that you haven’t seen before and might even annoy you. Though, while the characters’ traits aren’t problematic, there is a big lack of character development that would have helped this anime greatly. If Denpa Onna would truly have been a coming of age, some actual development for the characters would have been great. However, everything stays static in this series. There is also an issue of not enough screen time for the female characters in this series. The series is mostly in the point of view Makoto and we mostly see him jump from a girl to another many times in the anime and this only ends up in some sort of unassuming harem between two friends and his cousin.Shaft, as always, delivers in the production value. Erio might have been an uninteresting character after all, but her character design is probably the most interesting of the season. Sadly, the same could not be said about the other characters. For the visual, Denpa Onna has its fair share of eye candies and sparkles moments that will please any fans of the sort. I have to admit that some of these scenes were actually beautiful. Shaft is also more lay back in this one, and Denpa Onna doesn’t have too much quick and weird angle shots. The music is also top notch in Denpa Onna. The anime opens with a tad annoying, but very catchy song. The score in the actual series doesn’t have anything impressive, but it does the job well done. As for the voice actors, well they were great, no doubt about that.To kill the mockingbird, Denpa Onna is actually a very forgettable show. The anime did have an interesting and original premise, but it soon falls into something that has been done million times before. Still, if someone is looking for moe characters, this anime is definitely for them. There are some rumours about a possible second season. If this happens, let’s just hope Shaft does it right this time. which both have the same personality, are emerged in a world of bizarre situations.

If this happens, let’s just hope Shaft does it right this time.', 'The central problem with \'Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\' is the way it treats the supernatural. It attributes normal, everyday occurrences to aliens, espers, clairvoyance etc. Had a bad day at school? Must be god\'s fault. Achieved something you\'ve never even dreamed of achieving? Must be your esp abilities. Amnesia? Aliens. Cute girl smiles at you? Fate.You can pretty much see that this kind of storytelling is going to get ridiculous after a few episodes and sure enough that\'s exactly what happens in this anime. Despite the ""Sci-fi"" tag, there\'s no attempt at any scientific explanation either. Things that have no basis in reality and...haven\'t been proven scientifically are depicted in here as if they were the bread and butter of the natural world. And despite the main protagonists doubts as to such supernatural events, the anime pretty much ends on the same note - ""Yeah, it\'s real. Deal with it.""Now on to the individual components :STORY (3/10)Again, this is the weakest point of this anime. Guy comes to the city (Niwa Makoto), meets his horny aunt (Meme), his mentally unstable cousin suffering from amnesia (Erio), goes to school and assembles a generic, albeit miniature harem. Obligatory introductions over, \'Denpa\' shifts focus to supernatural events. Some of the most common occurrences in every day life will be passed here as being caused by some kind of supreme power that lives within all of us. Yeah sure, that\'s about as Sci-fi or slice-of-life as Norse mythology. I would have been glad to at least see some sort of an attempt at science here but no such luck.In between bouts of acts of god the story also tries its hand at drama and fails because most of said drama is either caused or attributed to... you guessed it - more paranormal acts. 6 episodes in and I already had to force myself to keep watching this anime because I knew that nothing intriguing would come from it. Moreover after the first 3 episodes, the story just starts repeating its own premise with minimal plot and character progression. Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 6 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 9 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 12 - Why did Er... Hey we don\'t know but here, chew on more alien and esper theory.I think what this anime relies on is the fact that you can\'t disprove the supernatural. You may not believe it but you can\'t steadily disprove it. At the same time this anime offers no insight or explanation of the supernatural. Most sci-fi works rely on some mixture of quantum physics, time traveling, parallel universes etc to explain their seemingly ESP-esque characters. \'Denpa\' is more of a case of ""believe it or don\'t"". Unfortunately that also means that most watchers will either love it or hate it, depending on their beliefs.CHARACTERS (6/10)While the characters in this show possess a decent degree of originality, as I haven\'t noticed any known popular arc-types in this anime, they also receive very little development throughout the show.A prime example of that would be Erio. Initially a social recluse, she opens up a little after her cousin\'s arrival and... stays that way throughout the whole show. She engages in very little dialogue and even though the name of the show and the synopsis would imply that the story will heavily revolve around her - that\'s not actually true. I was disappointed to see that she is pushed away and focus shifts primarily towards the protagonist and his micro-harem.The male lead himself seems to be among the only three rational and realistic characters in this show, refusing to believe in the supernatural without proper evidence. The other two would be Makoto\'s classmates Maekawa and Ryuuko who seem to provide even more realism to the series. Again, the problem with this section is that there is practically no character development present. The relationships between Makoto and his classmates go nowhere, the show doesn\'t expand upon their personalities from what we originally see and from the beginning to the end the show maintains a near-perfect status quo.Makoto\'s aunt, Meme, serves no real purpose apart from comic relief, with her over the top perverted antics. While initially being quite surprising and slightly amusing it quickly gets old, luckily the show reduces her role in comic relief just before it starts to get annoying.Yashiro\'s late introduction to the series made little sense and I think that it would be fair to hail her as the most underdeveloped character in this series. Personality-wise, she\'s an annoying shallow tsun character who runs around screaming about esper supremacy. Everyone else that I haven\'t mentioned is so far down on the totem pole that they are plot insignificant and only there to serve as background characters.ART (10/10)This is the strong point of \'Denpa\' as the art here is flawless. The characters are certainly appealing and attention has been paid to every single little detail. Static background is crisp and well drawn. I haven\'t noticed any mistakes in the coloring, the art is consistent all throughout and true to its style and as such this section deserves a full mark of 10 points.SOUND ( 7/10)While the opening is rather irritating with that high-pitched squealing for 2 minutes straight, not to mention that the rhythm just completely doesn\'t fit to the drum solo in the background - watchers will find respite in this anime\'s OST. It does contain some decent pieces, especially the ones that play during the more dramatic sequences of \'Denpa\'. The ending song, while a little bit bland, at least wasn\'t annoying.The voice acting itself was authentic and matched the characters quite well.ENJOYMENT (5/10)All in all I didn\'t enjoy this series. It wasn\'t bad but it wasn\'t good either. Something to watch if you\'re really bored or you\'re really into the whole ESP stuff but a casual anime watcher will be confused, bored and then agitated while watching this - in that order.As I mentioned in the story section you will either love or hate this anime. Holding a middle ground here is extremely difficult because this anime does not attempt to reference its content in any way. If anything, watch it for Meme\'s wackiness, or watch it for the lighthearted high school dramedy. Either way, not taking this anime seriously is paramount if any enjoyment is to be had.5 points out of 10. haven\'t been proven scientifically are depicted in here as if they were the bread and butter of the natural world. And despite the main protagonists doubts as to such supernatural events, the anime pretty much ends on the same note - ""Yeah, it\'s real. Deal with it.""Now on to the individual components :STORY (3/10)Again, this is the weakest point of this anime. Guy comes to the city (Niwa Makoto), meets his horny aunt (Meme), his mentally unstable cousin suffering from amnesia (Erio), goes to school and assembles a generic, albeit miniature harem. Obligatory introductions over, \'Denpa\' shifts focus to supernatural events. Some of the most common occurrences in every day life will be passed here as being caused by some kind of supreme power that lives within all of us. Yeah sure, that\'s about as Sci-fi or slice-of-life as Norse mythology. I would have been glad to at least see some sort of an attempt at science here but no such luck.In between bouts of acts of god the story also tries its hand at drama and fails because most of said drama is either caused or attributed to... you guessed it - more paranormal acts. 6 episodes in and I already had to force myself to keep watching this anime because I knew that nothing intriguing would come from it. Moreover after the first 3 episodes, the story just starts repeating its own premise with minimal plot and character progression. Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 6 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 9 - Why did Erio lose her memory? Aliens. Episode 12 - Why did Er... Hey we don\'t know but here, chew on more alien and esper theory.I think what this anime relies on is the fact that you can\'t disprove the supernatural.

After watching this I have come to realize one thing: how horribly distasteful these aliens are.Seasoned anime fans will take notice of the fact that this show is directed by Shinbou Akiyuki. You might recognize him for directing great shows such as Bakemonomgatari, Arakawa Under the Bridge, and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, which all have a similar formula going on: a male character surrounded by a harem of weird quirky females. Considering how much of this...type of show he has done, and the valuable attribute of the human mind to gain experience, one might expect him to have garnered enough knowledge to create enjoyable shows with absolutely no effort at all. Well, apparently, no. Either his brain has become too dense with all the success and praise from his previous works, or he just suffered a nervous breakdown to which he responded by making the most incoherent, dumb, and most boring anime he could possibly conjure. And that is Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (Electromagnetic Wave Woman and Adolescent Man).The story is the same old ""Guy moves into a city"" ""New home has cute girls in it"" ""New school has cute girls in it"" and so on. Oh, and the girls garner an inexplicable affection towards the main character. In the case of Denpa, a regular country bumpkin Niwa Makoto moves into the city to live at his aunt\'s house. Upon entering the house he notices a girl wrapped in a mattress lying near the doorway. This is how we are introduced to the show\'s main attraction, Touwa Erio, an amnesiac girl who believes she is an alien put on earth for observational purposes. The story then resolves around Makoto as he tries to help Erio overcome the barrier she has put up between herself and society. Of course, this is not a story-driven anime. You get the vibe that the makers didn\'t have any idea what they were doing and the story goes down the drain pretty quickly, as this is apparent half way into the show when all the characters are just loitering around trying awkwardly hard to get a giggle out of you. I\'d gladly pay you if you find anything groundbreaking about this anime\'s plot.The comedy in this show really throws everything at you, which at the base level boils down to a \'hit or miss\' game where the chance of a hit is that of winning in a million dollar lottery. The so-called witty conversations between characters that SHAFT does so well literally falls apart here. There are tons of dialogue but they just go into one ear and come out of the other, rarely triggering anything along the way. How could anyone rely on a cast of such uninteresting characters to deliver good jokes is beyond me.Animation is generally quite colorful and neat, but there\'s just something about the character designs that make them look overly childish, to the point that it\'s hard to call them ""high schoolers"". From an objective point, it felt to me like most of the work done in this department went into Erio\'s appearance and elaborate schemes to make her more cute, as she glaringly stands out among all the other bland characters that occupy this show. One of the few redeeming features of Denpa Onna is it\'s OP and ED. The OP sung by Erio\'s voice actor in an epic karaoke voice is quite fun and almost makes the rest of the show worthwhile. Maybe the unimpressive dialogue mentioned earlier might have been the cause of poor chemistry among voice actors because the voice acting here is decent at best.Overall, I have to say that Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko fails in soaring through the sky, not to mention space. The first few episodes might keep you occupied with a false sense of more to come but what\'s to come is mind-numbing stupidity and a whole load of wasted of time. type of show he has done, and the valuable attribute of the human mind to gain experience, one might expect him to have garnered enough knowledge to create enjoyable shows with absolutely no effort at all.

The story follows the daily life of high schooler Niwa Makoto who has recently transferred to a new school and a new neighbourhood. Makoto is a fairly normal guy, but the characters that soon surround him are an eccentric bunch to say the least. He quickly finds out he is one of the few people in this new town who does not belive in aliens, is a fan of dressing up as an eggplant (among other...ridiculous things) or openly declares themself as an otherwordly being. Its hard not to empathise with Makoto’s confusion, and its an extremely fun ride to watch as he discovers more about his new friends and family. In particular – the most intriguing cast member has to be his cousin Erio – a young girl almost as gorgeous as she is mysterious who has a penchant for wrapping herself in a futon and not coming out.Makoto’s new home belongs to his Aunt (Meme), who lives alone with the enigmatic and bizarre Erio. The dynamic of the 3 works to great success. Meme loves nothing less than to tease Makoto in particularly hilarious, manipulative and inventive ways which makes for a number of great moments. Throw Erio into the mix and the show presents a highly entertaining and unpredictable household as we watch Makoto struggle to live a normal life amidst all the weirdness. We soon discover that Erio has a fascination with aliens and the supernatural – she’s incredibly shy so it’s very  rewarding to find out more about her personality as the story unfolds. But the strangness does not end at home. At school Makoto befriends the bright and bubbly Ryuuko, along with the very tall, mysterious Maekawa. This pair also have distinctly odd characteristics and stand up as interesting and well fleshed-out characters by the conclusion of the series. To summarize, the underlying plot comes as a secondary device to the character comedy but toward the last few episodes the sci-fi theme kicks in a little more and the many mysteries of the show get a closer look. The balance of narrative and comedy is well paced and works to great effect.Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko’s clever writing and character design are matched with equally brilliant visuals and a charming OST. The background tracks are dreamy yet catchy. Both the OP + ED are top quality and the latter comes with some great lyrics in reference to Erio -”I’ll catch a cold, I’ll catch a cold, It’s cold without my futon”. Art and sound combine to make Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko a unique viewing experience.I can guarantee that you will not once get bored watching this show, and that you will miss Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko by the time it wraps up. You will miss the hilarity, the atmosphere, and most of all the bizarre characters that call it’s equally bizarre universe home.

I strongly urge you to pick it up and find out for yourself.', 'A few weeks ago, as I’ve watch the last episode of this anime, I kinda felt a bit disgusted with the genre of this anime, but the weird slice of life and mystery does made up for it, so my rating for this anime are the following:Story – good 7.So, this anime is not exactly sci-fi even thought there mentioned of extraterrestrial aliens and espers in it, but the story is not focus on Erio, rather it is Makoto who is the story here, co’z every episode is on him and his struggle to cope up within the weird world of the people around him....Also, the very thing make him the story here, is the way he keeps his sanity when everyone else is going cuckoo  by simple have a positive attitude and going with the flow. There isn’t much any comedy here and the sci-fi aren’t that much around it either, in fact those mentioned genres are just tidbits which makes up this anime, you might say the Yashiro is the only esper in here. There is of course the mystery genre like where did Erio went and what has happen to her during her disappearances only to reappear again and walks around with a mattress covering her upper body and why does her mother Meme is not even bothered by it, also why does Maekawa have to wear her mascot outfit even when she’s hardly even near her place of work and does Ryuuko have any idea what she talking about, those are the stuff that makes the mystery genre of this anime more profound than the sci-fi and comedy and what make me give this portion a “GOOD” rating.Art – Mediocre 5.There isn’t much for me to say about it. But I really like the way Meme the MILF is drawn.Sound- Mediocre 5.Same here, except I like the opening theme.Character – Fair 6.Well, I guess even if the muchacho (male lead) is the story of this the anime and everyone else are just additives it still deserves such rating. I don’t have much to say about each character since their roles are pretty simple. In fact their role can be compare to that of other characters from other anime such as Haruri Suzumiya , but with some twist (read between the lines “with some twist”).Enjoyment – Fair 6.As in fair enough to be watch by everyone, even though the skirts that the female characters were wearing are short  no panty shot were seen and it is also fair enough that it can be watched everybody that is if you focus on the muchacho and not on the Chiquita.Overall – Fair 6.I think that it’s enough that this anime would just remain as a season 1, that is unless some fan service would be included if the author decides to make a season 2.

(I don't do this normally and wanted to try it out)Story= 8Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko deals on the mysterious and the unexplained. We have Touwa, Erio who has been missing for half a year and claims to have been abducted by aliens. But really, what actually happened while she was missing? What caused her to have amnesia? And then there's Niwa, Makoto, whose line of thinking depends on...what can be seen and is proven, has to face these events.Despite this serious-sounding background, this anime is quite far from being serious at all. Dealing with Erio's condition and helping her return to  society as a normal Earthling is what Makoto is aiming for, while having to deal with some other things. I don't really think I've seen any anime with this plot, but I think it's actually pretty good.Art/Animation= 10I really liked the art for this anime. Its art is actually quite similar to the more recent Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (Which is another good anime I recommend) It's bright and very well-done. The animation (especially of that on the opening song) flows rather smoothly and deserves a perfect score on my review.Sound= 10The sound effects were unexpectedly good. The opening song didn't quite get to me at first, high and weird squeaky voice and all. But eventually, I came to like it and it's actually pretty catchy. The ending song, however, I didn't like as much. Voice acting is also good. No complaints there. The background music is what I'd like to point out, especially.The music  that plays sometimes in the background is outstanding and very well-done. It doesn't distract you from whatever is happening, and actually helps improve the setting of the scenes. Another perfect score there.Overall= 9Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko would've been nice if it had more romance in it. Relationships between cousins are legal in Japan, right? Either way. despite not having an romantic elements in it, it's still a very enjoyable anime and I recommend watching it.

Quite the contrast from Shaft's Madoka Magica which aired the previous season. The show benefits from strong and likable characters, good art, and a feel good type atmosphere.There is less of a plot and more of a tale personal growth and change for each character, especially our protagonists, Niwa and Erio. Not only how they grow, but how their actions, beliefs, and personalities effect those around them.As stated above, Denpa does not have a super deep plot, or a really anything out of the ordinary as far as the genre goes, but the charm the show...delivers is stellar. The closest show I can think of with the same charm level is Aria. However, while denpa might not have a complex plot, it does have a small one that connects the characters together.A person's enjoyment of Denpa Onna will most likely depend on how much they like the characters in the show and their gimmicks. Some have found them annoying, while others have loved them. Each character does have a distinct personality and a unique way to put a smile on your face.The show gives you a sort of X Files complex. As in, you really want to believe aliens exist in the show somehow. It does a good job messing with your head making you think one thing, and then all of a sudden you're not sure anymore.I highly recommend you check this out. You might struggle a little early on because of the pacing, but once you get to know the characters you'll be a believer.The Truth is Out There. delivers is stellar.

Let me level with you for a sec:Characters in the anime:Niwa Makoto: A dumbass going through puberty, but is probably the most normal person around.Touwa Erio: As intelligent as a puppy.Mifune Ryuuko: As smart as a six year old....Maekawa: Wear cosplay to work and evening walks.Touwa Meme: Mentality of a sixth-grader despite being 40 years old.Hoshimiya Yashiro: Dresses up as an astronaut to play baseball.Tamura (the old coot): Pretty senile. Obsessed with cattle mutilation.And they are involved in a comedy.When you have loony characters in a comedy, you can expect the intellect of the show to be pretty much in the drains. Despite that, there’s actually morals to be learnt which I will go through later in the review. There’s a lot of similarity between Denpa Onna and Arakawa Under the Bridge (also directed by Shinbou Akiyuki), and I will be constantly mentioning them in the review because it is just ridiculous how much Denpa Onna borrows from Arakawa.Story: 7/10The plot is extremely vague. Check out the synopsis. Everything written up there are the original bits of the anime that makes it interesting. So like Arakawa, there is a pretty girl who claims to be an alien. The interesting and most original part is that she wraps herself in a futon mattress as a way to avoid the society. She’s a typical hikikomori(social withdrawal). Then her cousin Makoto moves in and helps her get back into society. This is the proposed plot. Up to this point, there’s nothing wrong with this main plot. However, the plot constantly wavers to the side-lines as Makoto flirts with all the girls. There’s this one episode where he goes out with Ryuuko, and then the next episode, he hangs out with Maekawa. There are only 12 episodes to find out the mystery behind the disappearance of Erio for six months, where Elliot (Erio’s irresponsible dad) is, who Hoshimiya really is and which pipe hole she crawled out of and 2 goddamned episodes are wasted on building up the relationship with the two girls. Not that this is wrong or anything, but there’s just too much unexplained mysteries in Denpa Onna. How the hell can Meme (Makoto’s 40 years old aunt) look 18 years old?The worst of all is the way Denpa Onna ended. Okay, here’s how it works: the city is divided up into two, the City and the Shopping District. They have a baseball match involving the main characters and the winning side would have the upcoming festival taken place in their area. This is cool and all. It is a good scenario to allow the characters to interact with each other. But this is the last episode. The LAST goddamned episode! Why the hell are they playing baseball when they should be solving one or all of the above mysteries? Then things took a turn for total shitstorm when they decided to end it off with Makoto talking to some old guy about life lessons rather than using that time to show us footage of the festival. It ended very disappointingly, just like Arakawa did.The story isn’t nearly as linear as the plot suggests. An event happens and even though it could have been summed up in a single episode, three episodes were aired instead to show the same event from three different character’s point of view. This is without a doubt, derived from the creative mind of the director. Now let’s talk about the morals that can be taught in Denpa Onna. It teaches the viewers, behind the slap-stick Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei-like humor that if you try your best, you will succeed. Also, there’s the part about finding courage to return back to society, among various other things to be learnt from Denpa Onna. I expect Denpa Onna to come up with a second season to explain everything.Art: 9/10The art is really beautiful. It can be compared to Bakemonogatari or 5 centimeters per Second. All the girls are incredibly pretty and well designed. That’s pretty much all to be said. You won’t be disappointed with the art in Denpa Onna. That is a given. The main reason why this anime got a score of 8 from me depends heavily on the art.Sound: 8/10I am not a big fan of the opening and ending song. Initially, the opening song sounded like a squeamish toddler singing into my ear, but I have come to liked it because the song suits Denpa Onna very well. The ending song was really emo but I guess it was calming. The background music in Denpa Onna is pretty good. There’s the light piano music when Makoto hangs out with one of the girls, which builds up the mood. There’s good music to be found here.Character: 7/10Now I’m about to rant about how original/unoriginal some of the characters are, so forgive me if I write out of topic. I can’t help but notice how Makoto is a mirror image of Ryuugamine Mikado in Durarara!! I mean, the hair is just uncanny! I found myself typing Mikado rather than Makoto many times in this review. Ryuuko might as well be the twin sister of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! I mean, aside from the hair color, she’s basically a more childish version of Minori. They have the same ‘overly-energetic-attitude-that-makes-me-shout-out-everything-in-my mind’ personality. Then, obviously Meme can be found in the thousands of anime which have ‘Moe’ in it. All this characters kind of make the cast unoriginal, but then, there’s Maekawa. God, she is the best character in Denpa Onna. She likes to cosplay a lot, which isn’t an uncommon anime character trait. But in a certain episode, she dresses up as a Xenomorph from the Aliens series. A freaking Xenomorph from Aliens. I could not even begin to comprehend how awesome that was. I must have replayed that scene more than ten times. The way she nonchalantly walks into the baseball field with that costume. That was pure genius.Enjoyment: 8/10Well I must admit that I have cracked up a couple of times when Makoto tries to be the straight man against his aunt Meme and fails miserably. So that makes Denpa Onna pretty enjoyable. I don’t particularly hate being drowned in Moe when Erio, Meme or any of the female characters come into the scene either. The weird score board that determines Makoto’s adolescence points is pretty entertaining as well. I was intrigued by the unexplained mysteries but soon gave up on the hope of ever achieving the answers to them.Overall: 8/10Denpa Onna is like the Arakawa it never was—Arakawa with Moe. I guess the director realised that having half the cast being whacked out wierdos wearing freaky masks wasn’t going to win the hearts of the viewers. Denpa Onna is then created to make up for those mistakes, replacing crude old-men’s humor with cute Moe comedy and toning down the level of weirdness of the cast. Still, it is unique in its style and comes about to be a pleasant anime to watch.Ps. Oh by the way, it probably wasn’t the best idea to have the hottest character of the anime be a 40 year-old aunt. Seriously, Meme is hotter than her 16 year-old  daughter and the majority of the school girls Makoto ever had the pleasure to meet. Maekawa: Wear cosplay to work and evening walks.Touwa Meme: Mentality of a sixth-grader despite being 40 years old.Hoshimiya Yashiro: Dresses up as an astronaut to play baseball.Tamura (the old coot): Pretty senile. Obsessed with cattle mutilation.And they are involved in a comedy.When you have loony characters in a comedy, you can expect the intellect of the show to be pretty much in the drains. Despite that, there’s actually morals to be learnt which I will go through later in the review. There’s a lot of similarity between Denpa Onna and Arakawa Under the Bridge (also directed by Shinbou Akiyuki), and I will be constantly mentioning them in the review because it is just ridiculous how much Denpa Onna borrows from Arakawa.Story: 7/10The plot is extremely vague. Check out the synopsis. Everything written up there are the original bits of the anime that makes it interesting. So like Arakawa, there is a pretty girl who claims to be an alien. The interesting and most original part is that she wraps herself in a futon mattress as a way to avoid the society. She’s a typical hikikomori(social withdrawal). Then her cousin Makoto moves in and helps her get back into society. This is the proposed plot. Up to this point, there’s nothing wrong with this main plot. However, the plot constantly wavers to the side-lines as Makoto flirts with all the girls. There’s this one episode where he goes out with Ryuuko, and then the next episode, he hangs out with Maekawa. There are only 12 episodes to find out the mystery behind the disappearance of Erio for six months, where Elliot (Erio’s irresponsible dad) is, who Hoshimiya really is and which pipe hole she crawled out of and 2 goddamned episodes are wasted on building up the relationship with the two girls. Not that this is wrong or anything, but there’s just too much unexplained mysteries in Denpa Onna. How the hell can Meme (Makoto’s 40 years old aunt) look 18 years old?The worst of all is the way Denpa Onna ended.

Ever since watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai and the sequel, I\'ve been a huge fan of his.Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko unfortunately has quite a few ingredients that I hate. First, the protagonist is the \'hobby psychologist\' type, who thinks his viewpoint on others is absolutely correct, and won\'t back down from his arrogance unless punted in the head with absolute proof. Granted, we are talking about a girl who thinks she\'s an alien here, but the whole \'I am going to fix you\'...mentality of this guy is too cringeworthy to bear. Luckily, he gets past that stage fairly early and the rest of the season can be enjoyed in peace. Additionally, it does tie into the conclusion, so I am forced not to deduct any points for it.As much of a fan I am of Buriki\'s character designs, I think this is his weakest hour. Apart from Erio Touwa herself, he didn\'t bring a magic touch to much of the rest of the cast, though his style does pop out in every character. I just feel they weren\'t characterized much, not only in art but also in writing.All that aside, the anime does feel like a low budget job. From the opening theme, Erio Touwa\'s voice acting, to the fast-forwarding of minor events and the decapitated ""adolescence points"" sub-plot/ time-filler that has no relation to the anime at all - there are a lot of incongruities that makes this anime at times look like it was given away as an amateur prize in a chocolate bar; ""create your dream anime storyboard"".The season does get a lot better in the final quarter - maybe someone on the staff floor realized that the potential of this anime was greater than the effort they had put in it up to that point. Whatever the reason, it is a bit sad that it got a bit neglected early on, and that it didn\'t get a second season.Hopefully, Buriki will stay away from SHAFT from now on. His work on Haganai and Nagi no Asukara were way less of a waste of his mountainous talent.Summary of my ratings:Story : 6Art: 9Sound: 4Character: 7Enjoyment: 7Overall: 7 mentality of this guy is too cringeworthy to bear.

Something happened to Erio something so bad she lost half a year of her life and can only find solace in hiding wrapped in a futon. She is shown in flash backs lashing out at her...class mates. Really thinking deep into this it makes you wonder what happened and what if her fathers disappearance is linked?The point i think this anime tries to get across using metaphors is that when some one is depressed and hurt that just sitting with them and listening can better than any therapy. the opening song even mentions its lyrics. The people around Erio where so involved in there own issues they immediately vilified Erio, her mother even deciding it was easier to ignore her instead of trying to help. I think in a culture that is being so rocked by suicides there is an important message here.All it took was her cousin spending  a small amount of his time and caring to take a girl hiding from the world to getting a job and joining a baseball team.There are several other great sub plots about growing up and even in the end the ESPer story i think was more a metaphor for learning to question convention than it really was about a girl from outer space.All in all very few animes has left me days later thinking about all the different deeper meanings and hidden ideas. I could be wrong it could just be a cute show with another quiet reserved female lead for the male lead to fawn over but i don't think i am. class mates.

There was something about it that appealed to me and I don’t regret being pulled in because Denpa Onna has some great art. Sure Erio might sparkle a bit too often but those sparkles add effect and I really don’t mind it. There were times when Shaft decided to degrade the art during those not-so-special scenes which was fine by me. Although, during a certain episode, the art was so deformed it looked half-assed. Overall Shaft sure does some good close up shots and we’re talking about the...guys who did Bakemonogatari here!MusicTalk about the most dreaded OP I’ve EVER heard! Maybe I’m exaggerating a little but I really didn’t like that opening at all. The notes in the singer were going everywhere and being a music student, I couldn’t really take it. I will admit it was catchy but it’s just not my type of music. The ED was nice to listen to, but it doesn’t fall under the ‘like’ category. This also goes for the BGM in the series which also didn’t fall under the ‘like’ category. With the use of BGM’s, you want to try and add more emphasis to the certain scene. At times Denpa did execute it well but most of the times it wasn’t anything special.StoryI don’t think Denpa was originally supposed to have a strong story line to its slice-of-life feeling and because of that I was lead to disappointment. With all the alien references, I had hoped for the series to take a deeper dive into the sci-fi but considering I haven’t seen Arakawa Under the Bridge, I didn’t really know what to expect from Shaft. I still enjoyed the series for what it was.Bouncing off each character and giving each character individual episodes did help in character development but at times it felt as though some characters should of appeared in certain scenes but just didn’t.The flow of the series seemed on par with the story. There were plot holes and some characters just disappeared after a nice build-up of events leaving a very blended flow going up and down. There were times I liked some episodes and there were times I didn’t. An example of this was Shaft leaving the proclaimed esper near the end made me wish she was introduced earlier.Another example included the cow tag man being spoken of but was left till an episode or two later for him to actually get introduced and Elliot was never heard of after we saw a child version of him. Of course, it’s not all so bad.OverallOther than being filled with heaps of moe moments and maybe some fan-service, it wasn’t as interesting and enjoyable to watch as I thought it would’ve been. Erio deciding to take on star gazing and a part-time job wasn’t what I expected for her social comeback towards society and the other characters had some lack of importance too in certain scenes. As I’ve said, the music wasn’t that great, the art was nice to see but there wasn’t an actual solid story to this series.Should you watch it?You might be hesitant to watch it after a score of 6 out of 10 but this is to appeal towards a wider audience. If you enjoy moe, sparkles, slice-of-life or nice occasional art then I’d recommend this show to you. guys who did Bakemonogatari here!MusicTalk about the most dreaded OP I’ve EVER heard!

Well I'm not usually into a slice of life anime, I cant watch them but my favorites are all action and thrillers.The pace was random I suppose but all perfectly fitting to the end.The art and characters are beautiful, the story has a lot of comedy, whats not to like?But my very favorite is how deceptive the slow and oh so regular slice of life pace was, and completely whirled the story around last minute. Astounding plot twist, loved it! The anime left me stunned and impressed. Taught me not to underestimate the slice of life genre after all. "", ""Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko manages to slowly drag you into the story only to give up on you by the end. Providing a constant stream of comedy each episode is enjoyable, but after soaring to great heights the plot falls into a river. No, literally. I never questioned dropping it, but I felt like the focus switched from a comedy of a young girl who thinks she is an alien and the events conspiring around that to a slice of life.Niwa Makoto, our male lead, moves into his aunt's house who was apparently living alone. To his surprise he finds a girl his age...wrapped tight in a futon to be living with her. Thus, his sanity is put to the test as he takes it upon himself to convince Erio she is not an alien but a normal girl. On the side we have the classmates who disapprove of Erio, and warn him to try and stay away from her.That encompasses everything that transpires in a nutshell. At first the story is rather captivating and the comedy works well with it. However, after the first arc ends the focus drastically changes. The story switches to a baseball tournament. Wait, I thought this was about adjusting Erio back to a normal person? Now, it is still funny and it is nice to see him interacting with his classmates and neighbors. It just betrays your expectations a little that the story just turned into something average.Besides Erio there isn't much backstory, but instead the strength of the characters is in their personality. Let us take the aunt Meme for example; she may be 40 but acts like she is a little kid teasing Niwa, and is just awesome fun. We have Ryuushi who is energetic and who makes a very cute couple with Niwa. We also have Maekawa the more collected one in the show who almost subconsciously cosplays everywhere she goes. If we add Erio that makes up the entire cast of the show, including a few supporting characters. It may be that because the cast is so small it is able to make the few characters it has look even better.Denpa Onna was always fun to watch. After a good introductory story I was very disappointed in how it transpired after that. Yet, as a comedy it never failed to make me laugh once or twice. While ending up a different show than expected I would still recommend it to others.Thanks for reading my review and I hope it was helpful.

Well, this is the answer.At first, art. SHAFT's trademark, all those unrealistic sceneries and situations that together somehow make sense. I rate the art in this series as outstanding. Just watch one episode and you'll understand.Secondly, story. This is the only flaw of this series - there was no real plot, basically every episode was a bunch of more or less connected scenes, so we can enjoy the characters.Since we're at it, characters. Aside from the only significant male character being protagonist himself, this...series still deserves 10 in this section. I really liked them all, and when it comes to Erio and Ryushi (hehe) the combination of the way they acted and awesome art usually made me just stare at monitor and smile like a retard. They were insanely cute. At the same time cute like a puppy and feminine. Up to now, I never thought it is really possible.I'm not saying that Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko was the best romance anime. In my opinion it hardly qualifies to 9/10 because of the lack of plot. But I'm not saying it was bad at all! I really enjoyed it.The only thing is that some of you not used to SHAFT style may not enjoy it. All those unrealistic situations, talks, and just the way everybody acts may spoil the fun for you at first. My tip is, don't fight it, just deal with it that this anime looks like this. Treat it like an ongoing joke, and I promise, you will enjoy the series.Aaaand, that's basically it. I hope I helped you decide to try out this anime, or to look at it a little differently with my kinda messy review. Also, please keep in mind that I'm not native English, and some grammar, vocabular or construction mistakes may occur. If you detect one, write to me, and I'll fix it. series still deserves 10 in this section.

I have no idea where the writers came up with the title for this anime.Story 3/10It's difficult for me to talk about this anime's story since so little seemed to happen in this anime. I understand that this is a slice-of-life anime, but typically in slice-of-life anime there's more...character development or drama or something.I'm not sure you can even call this a comedy since there were so few jokes and I didn't laugh at the few there were.Furthermore, there all these plot points that were never resolved. Is Erio an alien or isn't she? What makes her hair glow? Where was she when she disappeared?Art 5/10If you watch a lot of anime then you know this trick: if your anime is dull and boring then just put a picture of a cute girl on the cover.There isn't anything that special about the art in terms of animation and character design.

By the end, she's still shy and afraid of people.Overall 4/10I was really disappointed with this anime. There's no story. The character development was minimal at best.

Oh well..."", ""To begin with i only picked up this show when i realised the art was identical to Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, which I've grown quite fond of this season, comparisons shall be drawn.I've not scored this show all that highly, and it could have very easily been much, much higher.The story is actually pretty deep, Makoto moves into a new town, with his 39 year old Aunt, because his parents have moved over seas for work, pretty standard scenario. Upon his arrival it turns out his Aunt has a child, his cousin, now a young girl of the same age as him, of which...the rest of the family has never been told about; again hardly ground breaking stuff here. The interesting part, she's a complete loon, who spends all of her time rapped in a futon, ranting about alien conspiracies. The interesting part here is that rather than being a loveable odd ball, like just about every other show, Erio genuinely has some mental illness/trauma here, and working through it, actually makes this show a little complexed in a good way.The art is well exactly like Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, i wouldn't know i was watching a different show if the characters started crossing over. For those who haven't seen either, the crux of the art is that the character models are very detailed in terms of facial features, lips and such, character models are all pretty much excellent, backgrounds and everything else is also massively detailed and really bright and cheery and genre suitable.Sound, Op is really different and i really liked it, despite the fact i'd never have played it a second time had i come across it as an actual song, very suitable for the show, good selection for the show from the staff. I'm not so impressed with the voice acting, i have no doubt the cast play the roles they're given as instructed, but its very flat, in stark contrast to Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai which manages to get away with allot of average material purely on the strength of the voice acting, watch both and you observe!Character is kind of a let down, Erio and Makoto are both kinda one tone, slow paced folk, the energy comes from Ryuuko and she annoyed me really quickly, Makoto's aunt was very cliche, although i did like the third love interest Maekawa, but that might purely have been by default. If you're watching these kind of shows, you should be only to aware that the cast are far more important than the story, and the short comings of the cast do hold this show back allot.Enjoyment wise, i wrote a good chunk about the story being deep, but it doesn't really come to anything, what actually happened to Erio to get her this way is never covered. The romance comes to nothing and Makoto never ends up with anyone, and generally it all feels like it went know were towards the end, with the climax being some largely irrelevant base ball game. The pace never changes, and it really should be shifting up a gear towards the second half. This might be down to purely faithful adaptation of only a part of the material, but still as an anime it is lacking for it.Closing comments, this is worth watching, it's short enough to be forgiven for pretty much any short comings, the art is always great, the story is light and easy, although ultimately comes to nothing, give it a shot if it sounds appealing to you. the rest of the family has never been told about; again hardly ground breaking stuff here.

The story is purely character-driven, the whole story is the development of Erio and how the Cousin is helping her along, and how, in doing so, realizes a lot about himself.Characters: 9/10-There are a lot of truly memorable characters here, from Erio the futon girl, all the way Grandma. Some interactions are of the shaft school of dialogue and animation, while others stay firmly in romantic comedy territory. All in all,...the characters are this series' strongest point.Animation: 8/10-It's a bright style, lots of contrast between light and dark. I like the character designs, the use of contrast, and the application of bloom and glow effects really brings an airy feel to some characters.Op/Ed: 8/10|9/10-Ok, yes the opening is out of tone, and it's schizophrenic, and it's different, it's not for everyone, but I find it particularly catchy, it’s a grower, it takes a few listens to understand how awesome it is. But I really like the animation and lyrics. The ending is awesome... It's disjointed, weirdly synched, uses weird instruments, and isn't so much sung as it is spoken. But I love that voice, and I love that toy piano.Music: 8/10-While the music isn't always prevalent, there are 2 tracks in particular that make me sing along/get excited when I hear them. That to me is enough to give the series an attitude and a unique feel, but I wish there was more.Overall: 7/10-This was a fun ride. There are a lot of great moments with great music and great characters, but there are a few lulls and when the story is already sort of weak, those hurt you. In the end, I it was enjoyable, like able, but nothing extraordinarily remarkable besides some unique characters and music. If you like the work of SHAFT, check this out.

I\'ll go with the pros first: good detail, realistic scenery, smooth animation of moving objects. As for the cons: characters look awkward at times, annoying reddish shades on knees, exaggerated lips. From this, it\'s easy to tell that I liked the artwork and animations for anything not human. The excessive use of sparkles didn\'t work for me most of the time as well. The OP and ED sequences were interesting and unique.Characters (8/10)If you were to take this from a teenager\'s point of view and a young adult\'s...point of view, the score might be different. If you like characters that develop and change their thought patterns and ideals as the story continues, then you may rate this higher than me. However, since I dislike  long and detailed soliloquies, I didn\'t pay much attention to them, thus, the characters were less developed in my point of view. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the main protagonist, Niwa Makoto, had his views of different aspects of life change a lot during these 12 episodes. Whether these changes are good or bad, it was nice to see this development. As for the other characters, they were interesting but not memorable. Although I must say that Touwa Erio easily takes the award for most moe character of the Spring 2011 season. Hanazawa Kana making an appearance as herself was a nice surprise.Sound (7/10)Like many others, the first time I heard the OP, I was extremely surprised. However, after listening to it multiple times, I found it quite catchy and addicting. The ED, on the other hand, didn\'t quite fit my tastes. As for the BGM and voice acting, they weren\'t particularly outstanding. Only the voice of Hanazawa Kana was recognizable for me but maybe that\'s just because I haven\'t watched much anime. Other than that, the sound didn\'t really play a huge role.Story (7/10)Honestly, this anime could have ended when Erio realized that she isn\'t an alien. Dragging it on for that many episodes decreased my rating. For the last half of the series, there wasn\'t much of a ""story""; just Makoto rambling on about life and whatnot. Maybe I not paying attention to any character who talked for more than a minute straight is what made me believe that a story line was virtually nonexistent. If split into halves, the first half would be a 9/10 for me while the second half falls to a 5/10. Average out the two and you get 7/10.Overall (7/10)I didn\'t really expect anything from Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko. Maybe the appearance of aliens would\'ve enhanced my experience since they talk about them in almost all the episodes. The only reason why I stuck with it was because of Erio. Yes, during every episode, I watched in hopes of Erio showing up and giving me my episodic dose of moe. Not a disappointing series but could have been much better. Maybe Episode 13 may influence me to edit my review. Who knows? But for now, the score of 7/10 stands. point of view, the score might be different.

One of the effects that is most common in the series is a shimmering effect that is displayed on Erio when she has a frame to herself, which serves not only to express her natural good looks, but also perhaps to imply that there may be something otherworldly about her; as if those sparkles are stars and her...home is truly amongst them. The only issue that I really had with the art is that there were a handful of instances in which the characters were ""chibified"" and while I\'m not opposed to this style of drawing, the infrequency of that animation style just made it feel out of place in the few instances when it was present.Sound: The sound design does everything it\'s supposed to, voices are pretty well done, and the opening and ending songs are pretty good to.Story/Characters: The story pretty much has to be combined with the characters in this case, due to the series being mostly focused around the characters as opposed to an overarching plot (similar to a slice-of-life, but not quite). The major concept sounds interesting with a town and girl who may have strong ties to extraterrestrials, and a young man attempting to help his shut-in cousin reintegrate into society, but the premise is let down by the characters themselves. My major grievance with the series is that most every character is, for lack of a better word, kooky in some form or fashion with little to no understanding of aforementioned kookiness. Niwa the protagonist seems fixated on the accumulation of ""adolescent points"" which would make sense if he were an otaku obsessed with dating sims or if it were a gag series that mentioned this occasionally. Erio claims to be an alien and wears a futon, Maekawa is a cosplay freak who regularly wears strange costumes when not in school (from an eggplant to a Xenomorph), the elderly shop owner is obsessed with cattle mutilation, Meme is an irresponsible parent genki girl, Yashiro wears a space suit and seems to be cut from the same cloth as Erio and a supporting character wears a cattle tag in his ear. With the possible exceptions Meme and Erio, no explanation to this strange behavior is given, and it\'s hard to relate to them.Enjoyment: Most of the enjoyment I got out of the series came directly from the visuals. There were moments when I did laugh a bit, but for the most part, the characters threw me out of being immersed in the series.Overall: If you like aesthetically pleasing art, a good soundtrack and aren\'t dissuaded from a series due to flat characters or a somewhat lackluster story, then pick up the series. home is truly amongst them.

I\'m still learning obviously.)Story: 7/10The first episode introduces Makoto Niwa, a young male teenager who moves into his Aunt Meme Tōwa\'s house after his parents go overseas. Erio Tōwa, Makoto Niwa\'s cousin, is then introduced to the story, who is constantly wrapped up inside of a futon (which is to be believed to hide herself from society) and she also believes that she is an alien due to a loss of memory because of an accident that happened 6 months before Makoto\'s arrival. As the plot continues on, Makoto helps Erio reach...out to society (also known as getting out of her futon and to stop believing she herself is an alien) and she opens up by getting a part time job at her great-grandmother\'s convenience store and she joins a baseball team.I thought the plot was very interesting and there were many questions that came up in my head that wanted to be answered, like ""Where is Elliot?"" (Meme\'s husband), ""Where did Erio go for six months?"", ""Who is Hoshimiya? What\'s her importance in the story?"" but as it got up to Episode 10 I felt that the plot totally dropped Erio and her importance in the story as a once self proclaimed alien and the anime started focusing more on Matoko and the girls\' he\'s surrounded by relationships. That honestly made me very mad. If they were going to drop Erio they could have at least explained A LOT more about her and then focus on Matoko x -insert girl here-! Also, I understand that Hoshimiya was introduced in the 9th episode or around there, but they didn\'t even explain her reason of being in the story at all in the last 3 episodes! ""Because\'s she\'s an alien esper?"" Please, there has to be a better reason than that, and that doesn\'t even explain WHY she\'s in the story in the first place.There was so much that was unexplained and that ticked me off, maybe it\'s just me, but I couldn\'t honestly care less about Ryuuko\'s & Matoko\'s relationship, that goes for Maekawa as well.I think what the worst part is is that the last episode was a baseball game. A BASEBALL GAME. I was actually sort of freaking out when I finished episode 12, the last episode, and was desperately searching for the non-existing 13th episode, I just couldn\'t believe that the 12th was the last! The baseball game had little to do with the actual plot that I was interested in and instead of attempting to solve one of the mysteries that they were once trying to solve other stuff was happening like Matoko lecturing Maekawa\'s Father about life and so on (which I thought was completely random), I would also like to throw in that they didn\'t even include the festival that the City and Shopping District were even having the baseball game for, but I\'ve heard from a friend that the OVA that I have yet to watch is about the festival so I won\'t argue about that.So to basically summarize all that I have just said above, this anime had a promising plot but then it all changed into some pointless non sense that didn\'t involve Erio\'s case at all, since that changed so did my rating. There was once a time that I had rated Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\'s story an 8/10, but since all of this useless stuff happened between episodes 10-12 and none of my answers were answered I dropped it down to a 6, mostly because I felt like I was teased by the makers of this anime but it was an interesting anime at one point, which it still is, but if I ever re watch it I will not be re watching Episodes 10-12.They had better make a Second Season to explain everything that was not explained in the first! If not then I\'ll keep the story rating the same.Art: 9/10When I first saw Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko from an anime music video that I had stumbled across on YouTube I couldn\'t help but be captivated by it\'s wonderful art! The scenery looked amazing and the girls looked stunning! Don\'t even get me started on how much I wish I could look like Erio! Because of the way Erio was drawn I actually now am starting to love light blue haired girls. The only thing that I didn\'t like though was the way that their lips were drawn, it actually has always sort of annoyed me. Besides that though I adored the art and it really helped raise the overall rating since I\'m a huge nazi on art styles.Sound: 7/10I\'ll talk about the opening and ending for Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko first, the opening honestly annoys me. I don\'t like it at all. It sounds like a 3 year old screeching, the sound behind the voice is pretty good though, but the singing just ruins it for me. The ending though is very cute and relaxing, and actually when watching this anime instead of skipping the ending like I usually do with all the anime I watch I actually would sometimes listen to the whole thing while in another tab. The soundtrack for the anime is, well, fitting. Nothing really else I can say, there wasn\'t really an OST that played that didn\'t fit with the current scene that was showed at the time, I personally thought Hoshimiya\'s soundtrack that would play whenever she appeared was perfect for her. The question is though, is it the best soundtrack ever? I\'d have to say no. You have to give this anime some slack though, I\'ve watched some anime that has a very emotional soundtrack like Fullmetal Alchemist which honestly brought me to tears, but you just can\'t compare this anime\'s OST with a masterpiece such as Fullmetal Alchemist, that\'s like saying Selena Gomez is better than Skrillex, (bad example, spare with me) those 2 are a very different genre of music and so are Denpa Onna and Fullmetal Alchemist, they are both very different (especially genre and depth wise), they are both very different with only minor (and I mean MINOR) things in similarity.My point is though Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\'s sound was perfect  for the type of anime it is, but it isn\'t anything memorable.Character 7/10:I afraid I struggle in describing characters for many reasons, but I\'ll try to summarize the main and some supporting characters personalities (and similarities to other character\'s in other anime that I\'ve seen compared to the character\'s personalities I\'m summarizing) in one go.Erio Tōwa (Touwa):Since the first episode she appears to have a very awkward personality. But after she acknowledged the fact that she was not an alien, she starts to relieve her true personality, that she is actually very shy and is hiding from society. I have to say that she is very unique and I actually cant say I\'ve ever seen anyone that was like her, yet.Meme Tōwa (Touwa):She has a silly and cheerful personality, and often at times a little evil. She enjoys teasing Makoto in any sexual way that she can. She also seems to care about Erio, even though she tries to hide it as proven in the first few episodes, by getting her a job at Tamura\'s shop. The only similarly I have for her is that she looks a lot like Ami from Toradora!, but that\'s the art\'s fault. Meme is also a type of character that can be seen in many moe anime, which makes her character unoriginal. She still is an alright character though.Makoto Niwa:He has a calm and collective personality but at times tries to go along with the flow and replies with an answer such as (""I see"" or ""okay""). He thankfully isn\'t perverted like some male leads in moe anime that I\'ve seen which makes him very like-able in my eyes, there really isn\'t anything I can say about him besides that though. He\'s original in some ways, but not really.Ryuuko Mifune:She has a very active personality, which is what most moe anime character\'s seem to have, I find her annoying for that reason and she\'s also just like Minorin from Toradora, which annoys me because I don\'t like Minorin one bit for her personality, even though Minorin does change I\'m talking about Denpa Onna, not Toradora!Maekawa:She has a calm personality but also likes to tease Ryuuko by saying things that Ryuuko tends to misunderstand, she also loves to cosplay and go on evening walks. Maekawa in my eyes is somewhat unique, I\'ve never seen an anime character that loves to cosplay 24/7 before so it\'s kind of neat to see someone such as herself in an anime.Hoshimiya Yashiro:She has a childish personality and she can get irritated pretty fast, I\'ve seen her type of character many time in anime and therefore find her annoying and unoriginal, but the fact that she is a self proclaimed esper makes her somewhat interesting so I\'ll give her that.All in all though I think the characters are basically all unoriginal with only the slightest things that make them unique, Erio and Makoto are very amazing characters though since their personaitlies sort of made this anime what it is so that\'s why I rated it a 7, and plus Erio is one of my all time favorite characters.Enjoyment: 8/10I\'m normally a person who doesn\'t laugh while watching moe anime, but, especially in the first few episodes, I found myself awwing and laughing, at a lot of things in this anime, mostly at Erio & Makoto\'s relationship which is one of the reasons why I really liked Denpa Onna. But just like I stated in the story rating explanation, the plot failed to answer so many questions and the ending made me want to scream, not in a good way. I did like the first 8 or so episodes though! I thought they were both very interesting and exciting, and don\'t get me started how much I smiled at the whole E.T. parody scene! Therefore I have decided to rate it 8/10, it\'s a weak 8 though, I could probably lower it down to 7 but I can\'t exactly say there was an episode that I found boring.Overall: 8/10I wouldn\'t call it a masterpiece, but Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is an amazing anime to watch if you\'re looking for a cute, moe anime with a supernatural theme. Stay away though if you\'re looking for a serious supernatural plot with cute art style, because that\'s what I was looking for at the time, but I was sad to see that as the plot continued on that it was turning into a more of a slice-of-life anime by the second and not so much a supernatural, and I was kidding myself about the \'serious\' bit. But overall, the art\'s outstanding, the sound\'s good, the character\'s are fitting with this type of anime, it\'s very enjoyable and the plot (aka story) is promising until the end.So even though it does end up to being a let down, I still recommend you watch it if you have some time to kill, because to be honest even after being let down I still don\'t regret watching this anime, I just hope there is a Second Season... out to society (also known as getting out of her futon and to stop believing she herself is an alien) and she opens up by getting a part time job at her great-grandmother\'s convenience store and she joins a baseball team.I thought the plot was very interesting and there were many questions that came up in my head that wanted to be answered, like ""Where is Elliot?"" (Meme\'s husband), ""Where did Erio go for six months?"", ""Who is Hoshimiya? What\'s her importance in the story?"" but as it got up to Episode 10 I felt that the plot totally dropped Erio and her importance in the story as a once self proclaimed alien and the anime started focusing more on Matoko and the girls\' he\'s surrounded by relationships. That honestly made me very mad. If they were going to drop Erio they could have at least explained A LOT more about her and then focus on Matoko x -insert girl here-! Also, I understand that Hoshimiya was introduced in the 9th episode or around there, but they didn\'t even explain her reason of being in the story at all in the last 3 episodes! ""Because\'s she\'s an alien esper?"" Please, there has to be a better reason than that, and that doesn\'t even explain WHY she\'s in the story in the first place.There was so much that was unexplained and that ticked me off, maybe it\'s just me, but I couldn\'t honestly care less about Ryuuko\'s & Matoko\'s relationship, that goes for Maekawa as well.I think what the worst part is is that the last episode was a baseball game.

As the rating I gave shows, I enjoyed this show immensely but there is a deeper reason behind it than just a cute story or character. This review contains MINOR SPOILERS WHICH ARE ONLY IN THE STORY SECTION 1st and 2nd PARA.First giving the headlines of the review:1. It is a deeper story than is usually perceived2. It is not exactly a typical anime3. There is little one wants to change about itNow moving to jumbled subsections:...Story 9/10Seemingly it is a non-existent story of just a boy staying with his strange cousin and getting along with her, meeting friends and seemingly the story stops midway. I look at it in a different light. The story is about a boy, who came to a city watched by aliens and finds every person strange and weird. The rest of the story takes him (and the viewer more deeply) into how different people, make things up, act certain ways, hide things deep inside, to show an outer covering that isn't what they are inside.The story starts with him mocking the alien stuff and ends (till the 13th episode) in him questioning whether aliens do exist or not. And other than a few moments, it is all realistic. Now all this deep and slightly emotional (for some) story is well hidden behind cheeky, relatable, and funny characters that make the anime cute but in a warm way. It leaves you happy.Thus it is basically a mix of a deep underlying story of psychology well woven with funny and quirky plus cute moments. It doesn't have any harem aspects (some may hint it) and is not a typical anime of a normal guy winning over girls through sheer love of justice and good will.Above, I have also covered Enjoyment so I will skip that.Characters 10/10Now the characters are actually well defined. After watching it completely it is almost as if you can tell what they might be thinking at such a moment or how they would react in a situation. They don't act out of the way and feel like proper... characters.Art/Sound 9.5/10Personally, I found the art very smooth, the style that SHAFT production has really shone and the glossy sweet faces matched well with the theme. The background, colors, details, and especially the hair... was beautifully done.Personally, I didn't find a flaw in this anime and enjoyed it above animes like Bleach, One Piece, Basilisk etc. I hope that this review helps you.

It's a great example of how care-free you can feel while watching anime. This particular anime is very soothing itself, and should not be overlooked as much as it is.Story: (6/10)Nothing too special in and of itself. There are two plot-lines you follow. One is Erio trying to become more of a normal girl after living (what seems to be the majority of her life) in a futon, not doing anything. The other is of Makoto trying to get used to his new life in a new house, living with his aunt...and Erio, and attending a new school. It's charming to see it progress, but it never has you wanting to know what happens next very badly. Take it as it comes.Art: (10/10)Shaft's addiction to turning heads shows up once more, but this time, even more beautiful. Everything is bright, happy, and shiny. Never a dull moment with the art, and the animators don't get lazy.Sound: (7/10)Alone, the soundtrack is plain, but it is used well in the series. It is silent when it needs to be, and can cause perfect feelings of awkwardness. The voice acting was overall decent, nothing to sneer at.Characters: (7/10)Erio is the most developed character and you grow to like her. The other characters are either cute, funny, or Makoto. He does not develop much, yet his personality makes up for it (mostly). Someone as strange as Erio needs a cynical friend such as Makoto to make moments even more light-hearted and funny.Enjoyment: (8/10)It was a nice, quick anime. I enjoyed all the goofiness, the cuteness, and the beautiful art similar to 5 Cm Per Second (even a quick reference if you can find it). Nothing I would go and buy, but it kept me happy and entertained for a good while.Overall: (8/10)If you have not seen it yet, I recommend that you do. If you want something light-hearted and visually appealing, this is a great one to go for. Not at all a waste of my time. and Erio, and attending a new school.

I love how cute the characters are drawn. Great use of colors, just plain and splendid at the same time.The story, although, depends on...the personal expectation on the viewer, me myself, I liked the story although the anime ended with a lot of questions left behind. But it is also soothing and funny at the same time.The sounds excel too, it blends well with the cuteness of the artwork, for example, the way Ryuuko-nyan talks, she's cute, I have to agree on that.The characters are well made, no annoying characters were made on this anime. That's another thing I like. The primary reason why I drop watching certain shows is sometimes the characters itself, who the hell would want a annoying character that keeps whining. I mean seriously..If you are looking for a light-hearted approach with a touch of comedy and romance, I would definitely recommend Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko for you. But if you are looking for more then this anime is not for you. :)OVERALL SCORE : 9/10 I love this anime, and I will continue to love it. :) I wish for a second season though. the personal expectation on the viewer, me myself, I liked the story although the anime ended with a lot of questions left behind.

Unfortunately after that nothing more. The storyline was puzzling, not in a good way. In my many years of watching animes, usually being puzzled about the story or plot is a very good sign of being interested because it means the series got your attention. But in this series, I was so bewildered in a very complicating way. It’s not even interesting enough for an average story. There were moments when it felt like senseless. Before I knew it, I was already yawning like...I didn’t have any sleep when in fact I had.The characters just kept on talking and talking about senseless things. It’s like watching a very boring conversation between two very awkward people. I could not comprehend what the hell were they talking about. Plus, almost everyone was so weird that they were talking and acting like they had their own worlds. Though, I am going to admit that they were very cute and gorgeous characters most especially the female lead. I can’t define whether she’s cute or gorgeous. It felt like she’s too cute for her age but too young to be considered so gorgeous. It’s like she’s at the peak of being cute and already going towards of being beautiful.Well, at least the animation was so great given that it was one of the latest animes of today. The graphics and how the characters were beautifully done was definitely one of the best.Seriously, I am very disappointed because almost all 2011 animes are not amazing or interesting enough. Oddly enough, for some reasons almost every each of them are pretty much famous but in the end almost all of them are not interesting at all. I am so puzzled why are these series so popular?

I am so puzzled why are these series so popular?', 'I was primarily drawn to this series mainly due to it\'s great artwork and because it seemed like it would have a decent story as well. So now that I have watched all the episodes I can come up with one definitive conclusion.Story. It gives us an intro and leads to the introduction of the two main characters Makoto and Erio, Erio of course being the more interesting character. She believes she\'s an alien sent to observe the humans, thinks she can fly and passes her days wrapped around a futon. She\'s rather carefree and pretty much doesn\'t care about the outside world other than...the usual stuff like food and observance. Makoto, being the main character that he is, can\'t help but want to know more about her. This leads us to a climax of some sorts early in the series, while entertaining and telling, it pretty much ends there. The good story telling that is. The rest of the series is spent introducing new characters and/or doing silly stuff like launching up stuff in the air or finding Erio something productive to do. While that happens though, you get to know the characters a little bit more. Story wise, it isn\'t very strong, I""d say it\'s ok. Not too bad or not too good, just there.Art. Lacking in story, but makes it up in the art. DOTSO has some very very nice art work. The backgrounds are detailed, the characters expressions, especially the female cast are very well done and attractive to the viewer. I give it a 9, it\'s done very well. A few things might bring it down, but I didn\'t mind much since the most important things stood out more.Sound. I really liked the cast in this.

I give it big thumbs up. I really liked the characters. They all were interesting to some degree, except maybe Makoto and Meme who seemed to be the more predictable ones.Enjoyment/Overall. I enjoyed it. It was entertaining with some funny moments, great artwork and great voice actors. The only downer was the story. Wish they could have moved along better with it, but overall I say it was pretty good. Could be considered a slice of life kind of show since the story isn\'t really complete in my opinion. I give it a low 8. the usual stuff like food and observance. Makoto, being the main character that he is, can\'t help but want to know more about her. This leads us to a climax of some sorts early in the series, while entertaining and telling, it pretty much ends there. The good story telling that is. The rest of the series is spent introducing new characters and/or doing silly stuff like launching up stuff in the air or finding Erio something productive to do. While that happens though, you get to know the characters a little bit more. Story wise, it isn\'t very strong, I""d say it\'s ok. Not too bad or not too good, just there.Art. Lacking in story, but makes it up in the art. DOTSO has some very very nice art work. The backgrounds are detailed, the characters expressions, especially the female cast are very well done and attractive to the viewer. I give it a 9, it\'s done very well. A few things might bring it down, but I didn\'t mind much since the most important things stood out more.Sound. I really liked the cast in this.

It had a lot of attitude and style to its characters, but I didn\'t really like any of them much. It is, overall, an interesting...experience, but I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone.It\'s a complex thing.Well there are some aspects of it that are plainly good or bad:-The general art style, voice acting, and execution effort are all very satisfactory.-The pacing is a bit slow, but it is necessary for all the inner monologues of the hero, which are the meat of the show, and do make it stand out very much.-The storytelling that constantly colludes an allegated ""aliens and superpowers are among us"" with conversations that make it sound like the hero is really looking for aliens and superpowers, is a very serious effort and keeps you posted-The characters reaaaaally aren\'t that fantastic, none of them, or even good, they\'re just a step above decent, a twinge above average if you\'re being generous-The story is interesting but is all over the place, never giving you a clear vibe for whether we\'re supposed to ship someone or not, if this is a show that tries to be deep, or if it\'s a harem with some weirdness-There is no real value to any story thread because of the aforementioned point, you always wonder if we\'re getting somewhere, and no, we never areThe gist of Denpa Onna is this: I don\'t know what they\'re really going for. What kind of story, what sort of message? There is a lot of value in the soul-searching about adolescent life and the relationships, even if it\'s a little too wordy for what it is. But is there something they\'re really going for? I don\'t know, even after having finished the anime, I simply don\'t.Erio is supposed to come back to society. Does she really? Not really, but a bit. She also has an affection for ""Itoko"" aka Cousin, aka Makoto Niwa, aka protagonist, but is it supposed to evolve into love, or evolve into him becoming her bridge to a successful social reinsertion? I still don\'t know at the end.Ryuushi is supposed to be the love interest chuniibyou, and I guess she does become the ""main girl"", but not entirely.Maekawa is the possible love interest that will almost certainly remain in the friendzone. But at the end, is she firmly established as a friend or as a love interest? More than the others, but still not entirely.There are loads of plots that are started but unfinished, thoughts that are expressed but unclear, and questions are raised by the dozens each episode but seldom get answered, by the anime or by us.And that is the conundrum here: I was interested, but don\'t know what I was supposed to be interested about. There were creative ideas, but I have no idea what they were trying to express.Denpa Onna was a mess, an interesting, original mess, but a mess nonetheless. I enjoyed it far more than less deep or less creative animes. But at the end of the day, I don\'t know what I was supposed to get out of it. For most animes, enjoyment is enough, but there was little enjoyment in this one, as it is burdened by long monologues that don\'t amount to much, and plot points that end nowhere. I see it as a project that didn\'t really know what it was going for, or was setting up for a very long run but only had 12 episodes and wanted to show off what it had coming in whatever light novel or manga it was showcasing.It wasn\'t a disapointment, but I feel as confused about it now as I did 2/3rds into the season, except my interest started dying out somewhere around that time. I finished it hoping for a conclusion, I didn\'t get one, and I\'ll be left confused.

He then takes it upon himself to reintroduce her into society.This is one of the most clever anime I have seen. On the face of it is a bizarre story with lots of equally bizarre characters. I have to admit I watched, loved it but had no idea what it was about. After a few days and weeks I eventually realised what it is about and here lies the genius. Although each episode...has the same characters, each one has a different moral tale such as sometimes people just need encouragement from their friends to succeed, people fear people who are different and dont't stop living until you die.As I said the characters are bizarre, except for Makato who is normal. Makato's Aunt, Meme, takes every opportunity to make him uncomfortable sexually, Erio thinks she's an Alien, his friend Maekawa goes everywhere in Cosplay, his other friend Ryuko goes through thought processes by making imaginary basketball shots, Yashiro, a small white haired girl, claims to be an alien and esper and wears a spaceman suit but the show leaves you wondering that she might be telling the truth and Meme's friend from childhood, Ashiro, wears a cow tag as a earing. The characters are bizarre but all extremely likeable in their own way.The animation is bright and colourful and well done although it's not innovative.It isn't a fast paced show. It goes along at its own fun speed. However, it is a very intelligent anime. If you like anime's to spoon feed you the plot you won't like it, however, if you like to find the subtle messages anime's often have you may well love it like me. has the same characters, each one has a different moral tale such as sometimes people just need encouragement from their friends to succeed, people fear people who are different and dont't stop living until you die.As I said the characters are bizarre, except for Makato who is normal.

But it was aliens. That is quite possibly the best description I can come up with when trying to explain this anime in once sentence. Shaft have a habit of either making an anime with many eyebrow raising points or one with cute but crude humor. In this they found a nice blend point that make you question what the hell did they make.Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko has a story around the daily adolescent life of one boy and his high school life in a city well knows for alien encounters. It seems a typical slice of life...story with an added harem for amusement purposes. Playing through, it seems to have two arcs. The first arc being the confrontation with the cousin Erio and the second arc being the mystery of a self proclaimed esper alien.Art is very pleasing to the eye but occasionally over done with sparkle effects and wind motion effects that are entirely un-needed. The colour of every thing is very similar apart from some scenery items that that tend to stand out in large amount of detail.Sounds for standing objects and doors, etc. are fairly good with even muffled thump sounds for a futon hitting the floor. It's really thought out well. As for background music most of it sound like it is a slightly altered version of music from famous Nintendo titles. It raises the questions as to what did they use for their musical inspiration as there seems like very little there.Character development is quite amazingly welled played out as from start to finish it so clear as to how the characters change and their feelings for each other change over time. It would have been better if more characters within the school had some development with the main characters as outside of the main group, next to no character progression is had.The enjoyment factor is quite high for the first 8 or so episodes while the last 5 episodes are somewhat dull and just drag on the average school day life with added mentally unstable side character. However the ending seems very well played out as after all the denying the main character does with the existence of illogical things, it really did come as a mind melting surprise. story with an added harem for amusement purposes.

You could probably imagine my thoughts on Denpa Onna when I first looked it up. I couldn\'t really find any substantial reviews or comments about it back then, so I didn\'t really know what to think about it at first. In the end, I decided to just try it out. And boy, was I surprised.I didn\'t really think much about Denpa Onna at first, nor did I have any anxiety towards it. But honestly, I was so wrong when I though it was nothing special. It just proves that you cant judge a book by its cover. Or in...this case, its title.Now, first of all, ""Electric Wave Woman"" wouldn\'t really be my first choice on a title. But as I got deeper into the anime, the name just stuck I guess. I honestly don\'t know where to begin talking about the plot on this one. I can\'t really explain how the main characters move in this anime. So I\'m just going to jump right in.Let me just give you a little pick-me-up... It\'s about ALIENS!... ( lol, that so did not do justice to the anime )The plot first and foremost, is pretty solid. I didn\'t see any rushing or signs of chocking on time, so it was okay on that point. Although I can\'t really say much about the plot. I have to say it is very interesting and original, but for me, I guess it just didn\'t stand out as much.The character development was pretty shakey though. Although it wasn\'t that rushed, the characters seemed a little bit hollow. But that isn\'t really a big deal. You can even say it adds more elements to the plot. But still, it does get a bit awkward at times.It\'s actually more of a discovery anime rather than a drama or a comedy. It brings a sense of curiosity to the stage, and distributes it equally and evenly. But don\'t fret. There will definitely be chuckles and giggles in Denpa Onna. Enough to satisfy the comedically-hungry mind.The art is pretty good as well. They wen\'t pretty straightforward with the ""moe and cute"" theme. The background is pretty descent as well. I can\'t really say much about the art though. It doesn\'t stand out that much.As for the sound, I honestly don\'t like the OP that much. The ED was fine and cute, and the insert-songs and sound effects are pretty solid. It\'s just the OP that\'s bugging me. Although it is pretty catchy once you get used to it. I personally don\'t want to keep hearing that song in my head. A little too much static.I guess what really captivated and got me hooked on to Denpa Onna was the atmosphere it sets. It definitely has that whole ""space mystery"" thing going, and I for one think it\'s pretty cool. Denpa Onna is pretty much good for all kinds of Anime fans.

This anime though tried to do too much and link it to the supernatural, which it failed on.   It also failed so badly on the romance side it tried to push, bordering a harem including his aunt and cousin.Sadly for me, the characters had no real filling to them, the eccentricity, just made it more forced, and left the anime for me, sad, boring, and a waste of a few hours of my time.

It starts off as an intriguing sci-fi about a mysterious self-proclaimed alien girl, and then switches gear to a slice-of-life harem surrounding other ""denpa"" girls.The first arc of Denpa is great and you should watch it given the chance. The combination of Erio/futon cuteness and denpa-speak creates for some really interesting character development and palatable comedy. The rest of it was average for me, read on to hear why.Animation:Denpa has absolutely stunning animation. The series has a lot of very serene, detailed backgrounds and scenery and some pretty cool effects. There\'s mysterious shiny particles that occasionally come out of...girls\' hairs (alien? dandruff isn\'t shiny...). Character designs are mixed as Erio and her aunt look great but the other characters are average. The only minor complaint I have is that the backgrounds lose a great deal of detail in some of the action sequences.Sound:Denpa\'s OP is a perfect choice for the series. Not only do you have a ""signal""-like instrument, but the melody and tone perfectly fit the series\' slightly out-of-the ordinary nature. The ED is also very interesting though it may induce drowsiness at late hours of the night. The BGM is a good mix of instruments and electronica, with some very distinctive pieces, enough so to acquire the OST.The stand out VA goes to Ai Nonaka for giving aunt Touwa an unbelievable amount of energy and moe.Story:Our protagonist Niwa-kun is moving to live with his aunt, and suddenly (upon arrival) realizes that his aunt had a child who she did not inform the rest of the family about. This isn\'t a sudden girlfriend appears as the child, Erio, is only interested in wrapping up in a warm futon and, in general, distancing herself from society.The story of Denpa is about Niwa\'s encounters with Erio and other ""denpa"" girls, in a somewhat arc-based format. The story was a bit uneven for me as I was greatly intrigued by the mystery of Erio and later Hoshimiya, while the other randomly outgoing girl and the cosplayer were much less interesting. The plotline is fairly weak after the first arc as it reverts to slice-of-life mode, focusing on character interactions. The series then takes a curveball (watch the last episode to get the pun) and turns to focus on Niwa\'s self-discovery. The story feels like it lacks a proper conclusion but that is most likely due to the fact that the last episode hasn\'t yet been released due to the earthquake/tsunami. We\'ll have to wait till the blue ray to find out.Character:As I\'ve stated above, the characters range from mystifying curious to wtf is this person thinking, though I\'m certain that was intended given the series title. The character interactions are very interesting, and expect some jealousy/push-pull over Niwa-kun by the girls late in the series.I liked how the story kept an air of mystery around certain characters, which is partly what kept me watching. There aren\'t too many characters in this so you can be sure that anyone who gets airtime is decently important (contrasting with Hoshizora).Value:Denpa is a fairly mixed watch.

After a few episodes the boy very early on convinces the girl she is not an alien, and the most interesting issue this anime had to offer was resolved 4-5 episodes in. Now, i rated this part a 5, but if i were to rate...the first 4 episodes, i would give it an 8...because the last 7-8 episodes are nothing special, just your average high school boy trying to score adolescent points (explained in the anime) by doing various things any normal high school boy would do...which is the problem. The one thing that this anime had above others that made it stand out from being just like everything else in the genre, is the alien theme...it is continued throughout the anime with a self proclaimed ""esper"" who wears a spacesuit, but the anime ends with the boy finally realizing his ""esper"" powers himself....which i thought was stupid because these so called esper powers were little more than what people would call common sense....he is told he can use his esper powers by suddenly cheering  on Ryuuko, giving her the power to make her free throw shots, i mean, normally theres no problem with something like this but this is about it when it comes to the anime, it doesn\'t try to go above and beyond but sticks to cliches and regularities present in a thousand other animesArt 7/10Nothing special about it, i only didnt like the facial expressions and how they were drawn, just not exactly something i enjoyed seeing almost every other sceneSound 8/10I quite enjoyed the sound track the opening wasn\'t too bad but the music during the anime was greatCharacters 6/10I can\'t really explain it much further than this....there wasn\'t much at all to the characters, about the only character development in the whole anime was Erio going from this self proclaimed alien to showing her normal human side and interests thanks to Makoto.Enjoyment 6/10i was highly looking forward to the episodes through the first 5 eps, afterwards watching 1 episode became painfully boringOverall 6/10Honestly i wanted to give it a 7/10 but i took a look at others that i gave a 7/10 and this one is not even close to being as good as they were, i normally dont rate animes below a 7 unless it really just did nothing for me, which this one did and didn\'t....maybe i missed something, but after Erio snapped out of the alien mindset, this anime lost its luster to me the first 4 episodes, i would give it an 8...because the last 7-8 episodes are nothing special, just your average high school boy trying to score adolescent points (explained in the anime) by doing various things any normal high school boy would do...which is the problem.

It doesn't matter what kind of fan you are in terms of anime, you probably WILL get bored of the genre after a while.  When you come out of the realm of what you are used to, you can either enter the world of a different genre, or watch an anime oddity.  Yes, this review is about Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, or Denpa for short, an anime that to me, screams oddity.  Let's begin.Story (7/10): The story of Denpa is about a boy named Makoto...Niwa, a boy who transfers into a city that has a history of strange otherworldly occurrences.  From him moving into the house of his aunt, he finds a strange girl who is wrapped in a futon that turns out to be his first cousin Erio.  From there, the story unfolds as he tries to figure out this strange cousin of his, as well as the city's residents.  From this story, it's easy to see how strange of an anime this can be as the premise itself probably can't be found anywhere else.  While the anime is focused on Makoto's point of view for the most part, the anime switches its perspective on which character its focusing in a sort of style that is similar to how Clannad is formatted.Characters (8/10): As I have said before, Denpa is a very strange anime.  Therefore, there are very strange characters.  First we have Makoto.  Makoto is a general high school boy who focuses a lot of his time throughout the series on puberty points.  In normal human terms, it's basically how his social life is going.  (They even go on a whole scene explaining it.) As possibly the only real normal one of the whole main cast in the series, Makoto acts as an outsider looking in, eventually delving himself into the world that is this strange city.  Next, we have Erio Touwa.  As the main female of the series, Erio is well, to put it short, an alien.  (self proclaimed.) On account of an accident that happened a few months prior to the anime's beginning, Erio has no memory of who she really is, and thinks herself as an alien, basically wandering about at night with a futon wrapped around her.  For me, I consider these 2 as the only real main characters as the majority of the supporting cast gets almost no screen time compared to them.  But I will say that each supporting member does have an odd quirk or 2 that adds more to the show as a whole.Art and sound (8/10 and 7/10): For art, the majority of the anime is standard fair as the characters themselves don't look as spectacular as some other works out there.  Most of the female cast has a sort of moe feel to it that I felt I needed to mention.  However, it does have a higher score due to the design of Erio.  They always put some sort of mystical feel or aura around her that makes her more unique then any other character out there.  Seriously, just look at her eyes.  For the sound however, I'm a bit sketchy about.  The voices themselves fit the roles well and I'm happy about that.  The ending itself is a little song that could probably bring a smile to anyone's face as how bouncy and fun it sounds.  It's just the opening that throws me completely off.  Upon hearing it for the first time, all I could hear was this out of tune screechy little girl voice that made me avoid it like the plague.  It's just really unbearable to hear in my opinion.Personal enjoyment (7/10): Denpa is one of those animes that you can't find anywhere else.  It's not a typical slice of life or any of the typical tags that are put onto this show.  For me, this was a true oddity and a gem in the realm of anime.  Because this anime was just so out of the ordinary due to its characters and premise, I couldn't stop watching.  This anime is so strange, that it's good.  However, there were times where the anime just dragged on and on, and it really hurt itself because of that.  The implementation of random characters didn't help either, and frankly, the opening was just bad.  But, this show is good in its own little special way as the show's title can tell you.  So, if you want to watch something that is out of your comfort zone, I would go for this as the majority of this anime isn't about school, it has pretty much zero fanservice, and it has quite an original plot in terms of what is coming out these days.

It\'s not deep and something that leaves you with your mouth wide open saying ""oh my god."" As I watched it, I felt happy, and fluttery throughout the whole series.

Unfortunately, they couldn\'t be more different.A&S is a low-key yuri romance, with its greatest strength being its well-rounded, convincing, and sympathetic main characters.  Ground Control is a screwball harem comedy featuring a bunch of over-the-top weirdos, who are rarely more than the sum of their quirks, and who are all unconvincingly in love with a typical male protagonist cardboard cutout.  Worse is the...amount of redundancy between characters, with two or three having the same overlapping quirks, making them so similar that even characters in the story sometimes mistake them for each other.  It doesn\'t help that some of these endlessly repeated quirks are tedious (the ""my name\'s not X, it\'s Y"" one gets used half a dozen times per episode).The first few episodes make a strong impression and are funny, and the last few start to get back in the groove.  The show was a preliminary 8/10 based on the first three episodes.  In the middle though, it turns into a repetitive haze that I can barely remember.  Shows that lack in drive or structure are often excused as being slice-of-life, and there are plenty of those that I enjoy, but this feels more like slice-of-nothing in places.  Sometimes the dialogue turned into such hollow white noise that I kept zoning out and had to replay entire scenes to check if I missed anything significant.It\'s possible that I just wasn\'t in the right mood for a series like this, so I\'m planning to watch it again at some point, but for now it gets 6/10. amount of redundancy between characters, with two or three having the same overlapping quirks, making them so similar that even characters in the story sometimes mistake them for each other.

I'm tired and sick of the generic beta Japanese main character that is so holding back and unable to do any shit by themselves. Of course Niwa Makoto himself have problem and doubts too but he solve it somehow within his reach and reflect it towards his actions.

So once again we have a girl who claims to be an alien living under the same roof with a hapless idiot.- Unfortunately, the setting is hardly as interesting as it was in Arakawa and its band of numerous weirdoes living under a bridge.- Plus the lead male is not voiced by the one who did Sayonara Zetsubo’s teacher.- Plus there is no contrast between rich and poor people to offer some...sort of social commentary.- Plus the whole alien thing is dropped almost immediately and then it just becomes a weird slice of life comedy.PRODUCTION VALUESI consider Arakawa to be quite tame for a SHAFT comedy but Denpa Onna went to further lower depths with even lowered production values. Although SHAFT is always full of scrolling panels, it still had some sort of sporadic quality in its animation and here it is absent in anything other than moe girl motions. Meaning, it tried way too much to beautify the girls and neglected pretty much everything else. So yeah, the female characters are all the epitome of moe (crooked bare legs, baby face, dumb looks, retarded tone of voice, blockheads) and everything else is left as an almost average comedy. It is still rather artistic of course, with its trademark fast panel switches, weird use of colours and shapes, but the CGI looks so damn dated for the year the anime was made. There is no abundance in weird special effects (aside from that weird glow thing coming out of their hair) and it is simply less thrilling than the earlier SHAFT comedies.Something similar can be said about the music. The music score is unimpressive and the dialogues are to the most part not as complicating or smart. From a point on they even feel tedious and tiresome. They have enough text to laugh or get to know the characters but still of NOT of great heights. Other than that, the girls sound super moe and that is probably the only thing most viewers will care about.SCRIPTThe story starts in an interesting way but soon heads nowhere. It is about people believing too much to all the modern conspiracy theories regarding aliens and some other new age nonsense. But don’t put too much thought into it; just like most ecchi/moe shows it starts with a bang and then just rehashes the same thing again and again, with far less context and spicy humour before ending in the middle of nowhere. As usual, the author refuses to stick to the initial girl’s development (or just end the series right there when it’s still nice) and simply keeps introducing more and more girls with similar coocoo problems in order to flavour the loli moe harem. Thus in overall no characters are really fleshed out much and are eventually thrown to the side for another ephemeral issue another moe loli has during its introduction. In all, there isn’t much of a plot and the bits it has are rehashed continually to the point of being bored of them. It would be far better if they were just making a movie out of the first arc with Erio.CASTThe characters are the usual “unusual” bunch of misfits SHAFT is so famous of making all the time. Most of the humour is based on their total lack of common sense that helps the jokes to work better and the characters to be memorable. As usual, their appeal is mostly based on quirks and bizarre personality and not character development. Also, besides Erio the main moe loli, and her aunt (a middle aged woman who also looks and acts like a moe loli) nobody else is weird enough to be memorable. Yes, the protagonist is also unnoticed as usual. But that is what happens in all harems; you get a bland male lead and a bunch of cute girls who all need his help and are after his d**k.Since the type of humour it implements starts to wear off rather fast and the succession of gags slows down more and more, I can’t say it is a successful comedy show. I also don’t give it much value (historical or rewatchability) because it lacks an overall tight and meaningful plot that heads somewhere. Bakemonogatari is a far better coocoo harem, and even Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is far more serious about its theme of delutional girls. You see, after the main series there is also an OVA sequel that for no reason makes it seem like the delusions were real and there are aliens after all. They did the same in Arakawa and in both cases they were nothing but fillers to waste airtime. The problem is that this way not only they trash the sourse material but also ruin the overall purpose of the show. Arakawa and Denpa Onna were always about a man trying to help delusional girls, help them face reality, and then SCREW THEM! By throwing in aliens the whole progress he achieves is rendered pointless since he now seems like an asshole who tricked the girls to believe a lie instead of helping them face the truth.LEGACYNow, many of you are going to say that I am being too harsh on what is just a silly moe comedy. So what if there is no plot; the girls are cute and it is funny. Well I am sorry but I like my comedies following a theme and doing something with it. This comedy did very little and then ruined even that with alien fillers. If all you want is stupid moe lolis, SHAFT visuals, and just excuses for escapism, then you will like this show a lot more than I did. The same mangaka also did Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai desu, so in case you want even more comedy about lolis and a premise that seems interesting at first but heads nowhere after a few episodes, go check that one too. For all I care there is no depth in them. Other SHAFT comedies as well as Chuunibyou by KyoAni, are way better than this one.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 1/2 (typical setting)Character Figures 2/2 (moemoe flood)Backgrounds 1/2 (typical looking schools, apartments, with bad CGI)Animation 1/2 (good only in the moemoe)Visual Effects 1/2 (poor for a SHAFT comedy; only the sparking hair effect stands out)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 3/3 (great moemoe voices and weird dialogues)Music Themes 1/4 (completely uninspiring and forgettable but not horrible)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 4/10Premise 1/2 (seems good at first but it is just a generic excuse for the lead to meet more lolis)Pacing 1/2 (simple and rather slow)Complexity 1/2 (no overall plot but individual focus on certain characters for a while)Plausibility 1/2 (all the weird stuff are simply the result of the characters being mentally challenged)Conclusion 0/2 (doesn’t exist; the OVA has some but it is a troll for all I care)CHARACTER SECTION: 7/10Presence 2/2 (moe and sexy girls)Personality 2/2 (coocoos)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (they do get colorization in the arc they appear in and then stay as such as they enter the main lead’s harem)Catharsis 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch)Memorability 1/4 (a watered down variation of older SHAFT comedies)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 0/1 (looks almost typical)Sound 0/2 (sounds meh)Story 0/3 (what story?)Characters 1/4 (the girls are moe and that is all)VERDICT: 4/10 sort of social commentary.- Plus the whole alien thing is dropped almost immediately and then it just becomes a weird slice of life comedy.PRODUCTION VALUESI consider Arakawa to be quite tame for a SHAFT comedy but Denpa Onna went to further lower depths with even lowered production values. Although SHAFT is always full of scrolling panels, it still had some sort of sporadic quality in its animation and here it is absent in anything other than moe girl motions. Meaning, it tried way too much to beautify the girls and neglected pretty much everything else. So yeah, the female characters are all the epitome of moe (crooked bare legs, baby face, dumb looks, retarded tone of voice, blockheads) and everything else is left as an almost average comedy. It is still rather artistic of course, with its trademark fast panel switches, weird use of colours and shapes, but the CGI looks so damn dated for the year the anime was made. There is no abundance in weird special effects (aside from that weird glow thing coming out of their hair) and it is simply less thrilling than the earlier SHAFT comedies.Something similar can be said about the music. The music score is unimpressive and the dialogues are to the most part not as complicating or smart. From a point on they even feel tedious and tiresome. They have enough text to laugh or get to know the characters but still of NOT of great heights. Other than that, the girls sound super moe and that is probably the only thing most viewers will care about.SCRIPTThe story starts in an interesting way but soon heads nowhere. It is about people believing too much to all the modern conspiracy theories regarding aliens and some other new age nonsense. But don’t put too much thought into it; just like most ecchi/moe shows it starts with a bang and then just rehashes the same thing again and again, with far less context and spicy humour before ending in the middle of nowhere. As usual, the author refuses to stick to the initial girl’s development (or just end the series right there when it’s still nice) and simply keeps introducing more and more girls with similar coocoo problems in order to flavour the loli moe harem. Thus in overall no characters are really fleshed out much and are eventually thrown to the side for another ephemeral issue another moe loli has during its introduction. In all, there isn’t much of a plot and the bits it has are rehashed continually to the point of being bored of them. It would be far better if they were just making a movie out of the first arc with Erio.CASTThe characters are the usual “unusual” bunch of misfits SHAFT is so famous of making all the time. Most of the humour is based on their total lack of common sense that helps the jokes to work better and the characters to be memorable. As usual, their appeal is mostly based on quirks and bizarre personality and not character development. Also, besides Erio the main moe loli, and her aunt (a middle aged woman who also looks and acts like a moe loli) nobody else is weird enough to be memorable. Yes, the protagonist is also unnoticed as usual. But that is what happens in all harems; you get a bland male lead and a bunch of cute girls who all need his help and are after his d**k.Since the type of humour it implements starts to wear off rather fast and the succession of gags slows down more and more, I can’t say it is a successful comedy show. I also don’t give it much value (historical or rewatchability) because it lacks an overall tight and meaningful plot that heads somewhere. Bakemonogatari is a far better coocoo harem, and even Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is far more serious about its theme of delutional girls. You see, after the main series there is also an OVA sequel that for no reason makes it seem like the delusions were real and there are aliens after all. They did the same in Arakawa and in both cases they were nothing but fillers to waste airtime. The problem is that this way not only they trash the sourse material but also ruin the overall purpose of the show. Arakawa and Denpa Onna were always about a man trying to help delusional girls, help them face reality, and then SCREW THEM! By throwing in aliens the whole progress he achieves is rendered pointless since he now seems like an asshole who tricked the girls to believe a lie instead of helping them face the truth.LEGACYNow, many of you are going to say that I am being too harsh on what is just a silly moe comedy.

I\'m a fan of Shaft productions but I was not fond of this  ending. (episode 1- 12, I heard episode 13 is coming on DVD maybe it will be the festival that we won\'t see for months D: )This anime with potential didn\'t get the ending it deserves. It ended up like a sports anime. Which there\'s nothing wrong with but it was an ""out there"" anime (one of the many reason why I love Shaft productions), A girl wrapped in a futon? That\'s very normal.This anime would of ended up better as an OVA for three episodes/It would of...ended better if the original anime ended at episode three. I watched the anime because of the production, the characters, that oddly catchy opening and ending song, the art, almost everything. The whole thing (or what I thought) was to focus on the character development of  Erio (our cute blue haired main character!) but no .. what happened to getting Erio in society? That idea died out quickly. There are little hints here and there that she is doing better but after that it just goes off. I was disappointed at the story but the art (9), sounds (9), characters (9)  gives Denpa an overall score of ""7"". I enjoyed this anime and I had laugh out loud moments  but that story is still leaving me a bit ""blah""~The only thing I can\'t get out of my head is  ""Meme is a forty year old woman"" xD ended better if the original anime ended at episode three.

After I finally found her I was so excited and started the anime up as soon as I could. The first few episodes were soo amazing and I couldn\'t stop myself from watching them one right after another. But, something happened. The episodes continued to get away from the plot and seemed to turn into fillers. I continued to watch regardless,...hoping it would shake off and get back to this amazing plot. Nope..

You can't expect any space battles or alien invasions, even though it does have something to do with aliens.The music is enjoyable and appropriately strange.  This show is also satisfyingly free from the melodrama that makes a number of similar shows unwatchable.  I wouldn't mind watching it...again some time. again some time."", ""Denpa Onna is an anime about the alien girl wrapped in the futon. This is a high quality comedy that gets overlooked.The story is about a boy who moves in with his aunt in the city protected by the aliens, and the humor comes from the interaction between this normal main character with the crazy characters of this city, especially his cousin, Erio, the alien girl. Erio is the main reason why this anime was so enjoyable, since she is such an adorable character. With a shy and cute personality, while being a weirdo shut-in, it's easy to fall in love with her. The main...character, Niwa Makoto, is not really interesting in his own, but the fact such an average and boring boy has to deal with all the wild characters is what makes this anime so funny. For the other characters, Maekawa and Meme are good characters, each with their own quirks. The only bad character is Ryuuko, not only is she annoying, but the fact she hates Erio for no reason and gets jealous of her relationship with itoko is irritating. She is not pretty nor interesting and the joke about her name is also too repetitive and dull, this character could have ruined the show if she had more screen time. It could be better if there was more focus on Maekawa instead of Ryuuko, as Maekawa is such a nice character and it is disappointing when she is not considered as the main option for Makoto, despite being part of the harem. All in all, there's a good cast of characters, but Erio is what makes Denpa Onna truly special.The art is another great point about this anime, as it keeps the standard for what is expected from Shaft, following in the steps of shows like monogatari and nisekoi, the animation is top-notch and elevates this anime to another level far above the average show. A good example of this is the sakuga moment when Erio's appearance is shown for the first time, a beautiful and memorable scene.The opening and ending follow the theme of the story with aspects of astronomy and ufology in the lyrics and eerie sounds, giving the personality to the anime.

In other words, they don\'t fit in with society so people assume they are not of our world.I, as a misfit...who also believes I don\'t really belong in the world, connected with this portrayal on a personal level.And I believe that a large portion of the online community (I\'m talking to you, otakus) can at least somewhat relate to this to a certain extent.But despite this beautiful shoutout to all misfits of the world, the plot of the story remained unclear to me.In the end, I concluded it was just about how weirdos and aliens fit into society. As well as questioning the existence of actual otherwordly beings, a question that many scientists ask.If that truly was the pure purpose of the anime, then I would say it did a pretty good job.Even though I was bamboozled by some of the episodes, I still enjoyed this anime.The characters were well-developed and the alien had just the mysterious vibe you would expect from an otherworldly being.Overall, a fairly decent anime. who also believes I don\'t really belong in the world, connected with this portrayal on a personal level.And I believe that a large portion of the online community (I\'m talking to you, otakus) can at least somewhat relate to this to a certain extent.But despite this beautiful shoutout to all misfits of the world, the plot of the story remained unclear to me.In the end, I concluded it was just about how weirdos and aliens fit into society.

Wrapped in a blanket. The summary of this Anime is so lacking in credit. The characters are hardly developed until the futon exposed a glimmer of that within. That is the way this sweet and intelligent series shows ground previously unexplored by the usual means. As in not the typical brainless high school drama. Just getting started. The asides of dialogue are nothing short of hilarious, and all characters play a role in the expanding critique of relationships. More to come. ', 'What a beautifully wholesome story this is! I was worried that they might make this far too weird with the alien thing, but it was handled so very nicely. Makoto is a wonderful MC and I absolutely loved that Ryouko was put into daily life without a forced relationship. There is jealousy with Maekwan, but it was not overbearing and she handled it rationally rather than acting on emotions like you see in so many different places. It\'s so hard not to like every character here.The kids were portrayed as kids their age. Makoto kept track of ""adolescent points"" to see how he changed or...where he sat as part of an identity each day. It was able point that allowed the characters to connect to the watchers, particularly those are the same age. They were allowed to just be what they were supposed to be. There are only two really good friends to Makoto and that\'s it. Often shows load up on five and six and seven friends that are completely unnecessary.While the visuals weren\'t beautiful overall, the night sky depictions were gorgeous. I just cannot believe how wonderfully this was done. You don\'t see gems like this very often.Definitely take a look.

Ginga Kikoutai Majestic Prince Movie: Kakusei no Idenshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33025/Ginga_Kikoutai_Majestic_Prince_Movie__Kakusei_no_Idenshi,"['[SPOILER WARNING]The Spring of 2013 or 2013 was a year when anime got MORE awesome! We got hit after hit, and it was a brilliant year for Mecha. The three spring anime of 2013 was Gargantia, Valvrave and of course Majestic Prince. Those three mecha anime became classics to me each one giving a different synopsis for the Mecha Genre. Now a days it has been almost 4 years later since the writing of this review and I finally realized that after the Spring of 2014, Mecha has been dying. It seems to me that we are getting an increase of Highschool slices of life...here and there and the very common all girl casts anime with subtle lesbian undertones for ridiculous amounts of pandering. This is because as times change there becomes a new ground rule of \'what anime to make\' in the market. It is a business after all. I will admit, those slices of life do have a lot of charm! But what if I told you that the Spring Mecha anime of 2013 had a lot of charm too with a more interesting plot? Well I would have to tell you that we are living in a dark age of anime and anime like Majestic Prince has to exist to save the industry from becoming complete trash and further ruining the reputation of anime itself.Story: 7Ginga Kikoutai Majestic Prince is about 5/6 teenaged genetically modified kids assigned the most interesting of mechs called ASHMB units. These units can only be piloted by them due to their assigned DNA and they are somewhat sentient on Fly or Fight mentality. Pretty cool huh? So they use these units to combat the Wulgaru who are trying to kill off humanity to recover lost genes to keep themselves alive. Trust me, it makes more sense in context. The movie takes place after the final episode of the show. Everyone is freaking out because Izuru almost died and a brand new Walgaru threat has revealed itself. A terrifying enemy that is possibly even stronger than Jiart. It\'s up to Team Rabbits, Faun and Fox to saaaaave the day! It\'s a simple story. Nothing wrong but still full of emotional ties that are required to give a crap about the plot. Honestly a story can be broken down to the basic bullet notes and can be seen as boring. A GOOD story is about presentation, not good writing. You can have the most boring premise in the world and still make it interesting and emotional. On the other hand you can have an intense situation and make it boring as hell. Majestic Prince avoids this by adding something I like to call \'narm charm\'. All in all the story is basic and full of interesting premises to keep you in tact. And in stories like this that is ALL what you need. However, the main point of THIS story is about Asagi figuring out what HE wants to do. So the story focuses a bit more on him.Art: 10People might disagree with me but I admire Hisashi Hirai\'s character designs. Though one can make the argument that every character looks the same besides eye color and hair color, Hisashi Hirai\'s art has a VERY strong power. Emotions. The guy isn\'t afraid to cram in as many emotions into his character designs as possible. There is a reason why Hiashi reuses the same face: It works. The face can express so many emotions, rage face, super happy, embarrassed and my personal favorite ""-_-"". His character designs have something else that modern day developers struggle with today, and identity. Everywhere you look modern day anime continues to look the same with character designs because of the unfortunate reality that one design sells like hot cakes. I\'m talking about that damn A-1 face that was perfected. There aren\'t a lot of anime anymore that has a unique and distinguishable art design. Yes a select few exist, but noticed how anime continues to really on the same art direction? It\'s a BREATH of fresh air to see Hisashi Hirai\'s character designs after seeing constant and constant anime character designs that come out of a factory. His designs have so much charm in them and I wish people can appreciate his designs more.And the BEAUTIFUL mecha animation! Yes the humans get a bit stiff when they walk, but to be honest I feel like those cuts were made to create the bread and butter of Mecha anime. Relying on Hisashi\'s character designs to be as expressive as possible to pull up the lack of animation, the mecha animation and choreography is just as good if not better than the actual show. Gargantia\'s appeal was the unique premise, Valvrave\'s appeal was it\'s ridiculous over the top concept flashing so many cliff hangers, Majestic Prince\'s strengths are its charms and MECHA FIGHTING ANIMATION. You thought CGi mecha animation was slow, THINK AGAIN. The action in Majestic Prince follows a simple formula of Camera panning when the time is RIGHT. Not constant camera panning to the point it distracts you from the animation, but angling it just right to make the animation even more crisp. You see it all, every slash, missile and laser making an intense impact with some extreme weight involved. Indeed the animation is good, but just because it has great animation you need to make sure if it was put into good use. The lighting of the attacks are just too damn perfect. I can HEAVILY agree on the idea that the choreography is so damn good it blew my god damn ball sack to the moon. And now I need to get it back. However, fighting alone isn\'t enough to make a \'fight\' scene interesting. It needs something else involved...Sound: 9It needs sound. You need to hear every impact, every point of strike with the noise to understand the intensity of the fights. The music in Majestic Prince isn\'t the best, but it sparks an emotion to use the theme songs including the new one for this movie! I like it! Let\'s talk about voice acting for a second here. Voice acting in anime is hard to criticize. Despite watching subbed anime for so many years I only came across a few sub voices in my life that I wish never existed. Japanese Goku, the asshole dark knight from Grimgar and EVERY high pitched anime girl that is trying too hard to sound like they are 10 when they are clearly over 20. I know that in Japan their females have some squeaky voices but let\'s be real here! If you ever heard an actual japanese woman talks, their voices are soft and high pitched but not to the point of being SQUEAKY. As if they are trying to sound too HARD to be cute. Tamaki\'s voice strikes a nice balance for this. She doesn\'t constantly scream all the time, she has more snarky -_- moments to adjust her voice to avoid sounding too much like a child. Tamaki is a good example on how to use a high pitched voice without coming off as too screamy and squeaky to the point of being cringy. Asagi\'s voice actor does his role of being a not so confident teen who constantly questions why people keep entering his god damn room. Izuru sounds like a dork, Ange\'s shounen kid voice with constant vulgar voices is freaking amazing to listen to, Kei is soft spoken and Ateru is cocky with his voice. Exactly what you would expect from these characters. Once again I gone off a tangent here, but when it comes to voice acting in subs you don\'t care about inflections due to not clearly understanding the japanese language. Instead it all comes down to voice range and avoiding a point of coming across as forced and just overall annoying.Character: 10Some people argue that Story and Character are basically the same thing, I disagree. Story is the situation they are in and how the twists and turns along with the slopes and downward spirals entertain someone. Characters are they people that grant LIFE into the world they live in. Team Rabbits along with the other characters are VERY 2D. But that\'s the point. They grew up in a military academy and only had ONE interest to grant them life. Meaning they focus on that interest to grant them character. The characters bicker and support each other, even take shots at one another. Small subtle things in anime helps bring so much life into them. Izuru wanting to be a cheesy hero and looking up to Asagi as his new found brother...to Asagi\'s embarrassment of course, Asagi\'s anxiety of being cool or being a leader bringing him down, Ateru\'s nerdgasms, Ange\'s VULGAR language, Kei\'s deadly cooking that somehow has the amazing ability to bring Izuru back to the way he is and Tamaki being a cheerful ditz that wishes to love. These are basic 2d traits that are endearing when planted together. Imagine if Power Rangers had more freedom to be charming with their characters, you get the Majestic Prince cast. You don\'t need 3D characters to have them be interesting or fun. 2d characters have strengths too! They are easy to understand and their quirks can easily sway you. Like going into Asagi\'s god damn room. What I\'m trying to say is that Team Rabbit\'s appeal comes from small gentle emotions and teen friendly bickering that is very fun to watch. I also find it very touching where Tamaki tells Patricia thank you because she couldn\'t say it to Patrick. Though I will admit Patricia RUINED the moment by asking to grope Tamaki after all of this is done, but I\'m glad that Tamaki\'s reaction completely reflected my own. -_- Meaning it was intentional. And I will never forget the moment where the entire crew came to Izuru\'s healing pod to write down get well messages on the glass. THIS is what I mean by CHARM and EMOTIONS. It might be silly but it works. Even having call backs with the Otakus to inspire Izuru to DRAW FREAKEN BETTER. Damn it! He better get better with his crappy manga. Anyways! Characters are charming and easily likable! It\'s easy to sympathize with Asagi...and...let\'s FOCUS on him for a moment.Asagi is no doubt about it the main character for the movie. While Izuru is out of commission Asagi has been appointed for the leader despite his hesitation. He isn\'t confident, he is scared and most importantly he probably thinks he can\'t live up to be a hero like Izuru despite what he says. However, he learns to be a hero for his little brother. Asagi unlike the rest of his crew doesn\'t really have a quirk of \'interest\'. Instead Asagi\'s role in the series is more of an emotional connection with his little sister like figure, his tech crew being a family, and most importantly finding a cause. Asagi is the deepest character in Majestic Prince and I would argue he might actually be 3D. I GET this guy. He learns about Izuru being his little brother and decides to take action. He needs to protect his little brother! And when he gets shot down after his BEAUTIFUL display of Blue 1, I was heart broken that he was robbed before taking up White 0. He learns to be his own kind of hero. A big brother, a family man like his tech crew, to be a true big brother. That is Asagi\'s character.Enjoyment: 10I had never had so much fun watching an anime before. It\'s been VERY long. Too long perhaps. Majestic Prince reminds me why I love anime so much. Mecha, action and of course charming characters that I will never forget. The final moment of Team Rabbits defeating the alien vulgar as shit lady is EXACTLY what I love about anime like this. The theme of team work and not just SHOUTING OUT to the main character to win with the power of friendship is how you DO IT RIGHT. Team Rabbits as a WHOLE defeated her. Kei awakens her unit to help Asagi pilot White 0. Izuru is still recovering so he isn\'t at 100 percent to rob the show\'s finale(Which I feared what would happen), Ateru takes the final shot while Tamaki injects power into Gold 4. And finally Ange gets the LAST vulgar line despite Black 6 being completely out of commission. THEY ALL DID IT. That is when I went bonkers. I want that...I want more of those moments in my anime. It\'s so...sad that these don\'t appear more often, but you know what they still exist. Vulgar alien language on Vulgar alien language people. You must see it to believe it.Overall: 9Charm, action, expressions, laughs, emotions...this is what I call anime that still tries. This is an anime that needs to be watched by not only mecha lovers but also others who wish to explore the regions of Hisashi Hirai art and the wondrous properties of charm in anime. Let it not die, please continue to make anime like this. And why are you people in Asagi\'s room? here and there and the very common all girl casts anime with subtle lesbian undertones for ridiculous amounts of pandering. This is because as times change there becomes a new ground rule of \'what anime to make\' in the market. It is a business after all. I will admit, those slices of life do have a lot of charm! But what if I told you that the Spring Mecha anime of 2013 had a lot of charm too with a more interesting plot? Well I would have to tell you that we are living in a dark age of anime and anime like Majestic Prince has to exist to save the industry from becoming complete trash and further ruining the reputation of anime itself.Story: 7Ginga Kikoutai Majestic Prince is about 5/6 teenaged genetically modified kids assigned the most interesting of mechs called ASHMB units. These units can only be piloted by them due to their assigned DNA and they are somewhat sentient on Fly or Fight mentality. Pretty cool huh? So they use these units to combat the Wulgaru who are trying to kill off humanity to recover lost genes to keep themselves alive. Trust me, it makes more sense in context. The movie takes place after the final episode of the show. Everyone is freaking out because Izuru almost died and a brand new Walgaru threat has revealed itself. A terrifying enemy that is possibly even stronger than Jiart. It\'s up to Team Rabbits, Faun and Fox to saaaaave the day! It\'s a simple story. Nothing wrong but still full of emotional ties that are required to give a crap about the plot. Honestly a story can be broken down to the basic bullet notes and can be seen as boring. A GOOD story is about presentation, not good writing. You can have the most boring premise in the world and still make it interesting and emotional. On the other hand you can have an intense situation and make it boring as hell. Majestic Prince avoids this by adding something I like to call \'narm charm\'. All in all the story is basic and full of interesting premises to keep you in tact. And in stories like this that is ALL what you need. However, the main point of THIS story is about Asagi figuring out what HE wants to do. So the story focuses a bit more on him.Art: 10People might disagree with me but I admire Hisashi Hirai\'s character designs. Though one can make the argument that every character looks the same besides eye color and hair color, Hisashi Hirai\'s art has a VERY strong power. Emotions. The guy isn\'t afraid to cram in as many emotions into his character designs as possible. There is a reason why Hiashi reuses the same face: It works. The face can express so many emotions, rage face, super happy, embarrassed and my personal favorite ""-_-"". His character designs have something else that modern day developers struggle with today, and identity. Everywhere you look modern day anime continues to look the same with character designs because of the unfortunate reality that one design sells like hot cakes. I\'m talking about that damn A-1 face that was perfected. There aren\'t a lot of anime anymore that has a unique and distinguishable art design. Yes a select few exist, but noticed how anime continues to really on the same art direction? It\'s a BREATH of fresh air to see Hisashi Hirai\'s character designs after seeing constant and constant anime character designs that come out of a factory. His designs have so much charm in them and I wish people can appreciate his designs more.And the BEAUTIFUL mecha animation! Yes the humans get a bit stiff when they walk, but to be honest I feel like those cuts were made to create the bread and butter of Mecha anime. Relying on Hisashi\'s character designs to be as expressive as possible to pull up the lack of animation, the mecha animation and choreography is just as good if not better than the actual show. Gargantia\'s appeal was the unique premise, Valvrave\'s appeal was it\'s ridiculous over the top concept flashing so many cliff hangers, Majestic Prince\'s strengths are its charms and MECHA FIGHTING ANIMATION. You thought CGi mecha animation was slow, THINK AGAIN. The action in Majestic Prince follows a simple formula of Camera panning when the time is RIGHT. Not constant camera panning to the point it distracts you from the animation, but angling it just right to make the animation even more crisp. You see it all, every slash, missile and laser making an intense impact with some extreme weight involved. Indeed the animation is good, but just because it has great animation you need to make sure if it was put into good use. The lighting of the attacks are just too damn perfect. I can HEAVILY agree on the idea that the choreography is so damn good it blew my god damn ball sack to the moon. And now I need to get it back. However, fighting alone isn\'t enough to make a \'fight\' scene interesting. It needs something else involved...Sound: 9It needs sound. You need to hear every impact, every point of strike with the noise to understand the intensity of the fights. The music in Majestic Prince isn\'t the best, but it sparks an emotion to use the theme songs including the new one for this movie! I like it! Let\'s talk about voice acting for a second here. Voice acting in anime is hard to criticize. Despite watching subbed anime for so many years I only came across a few sub voices in my life that I wish never existed. Japanese Goku, the asshole dark knight from Grimgar and EVERY high pitched anime girl that is trying too hard to sound like they are 10 when they are clearly over 20. I know that in Japan their females have some squeaky voices but let\'s be real here! If you ever heard an actual japanese woman talks, their voices are soft and high pitched but not to the point of being SQUEAKY. As if they are trying to sound too HARD to be cute. Tamaki\'s voice strikes a nice balance for this. She doesn\'t constantly scream all the time, she has more snarky -_- moments to adjust her voice to avoid sounding too much like a child. Tamaki is a good example on how to use a high pitched voice without coming off as too screamy and squeaky to the point of being cringy. Asagi\'s voice actor does his role of being a not so confident teen who constantly questions why people keep entering his god damn room. Izuru sounds like a dork, Ange\'s shounen kid voice with constant vulgar voices is freaking amazing to listen to, Kei is soft spoken and Ateru is cocky with his voice. Exactly what you would expect from these characters. Once again I gone off a tangent here, but when it comes to voice acting in subs you don\'t care about inflections due to not clearly understanding the japanese language. Instead it all comes down to voice range and avoiding a point of coming across as forced and just overall annoying.Character: 10Some people argue that Story and Character are basically the same thing, I disagree. Story is the situation they are in and how the twists and turns along with the slopes and downward spirals entertain someone. Characters are they people that grant LIFE into the world they live in. Team Rabbits along with the other characters are VERY 2D. But that\'s the point. They grew up in a military academy and only had ONE interest to grant them life. Meaning they focus on that interest to grant them character. The characters bicker and support each other, even take shots at one another. Small subtle things in anime helps bring so much life into them.

Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3231/Gunslinger_Girl__Il_Teatrino,"['I\'m hearing so much bleating about how different S2 is to S1, I thought I\'d better jot down a couple of pointers for the uninformed.Anybody who\'s watched S1 will realise that Madhouse spoilt us - everything was right, the artwork, the music, the character design and most of all the story. When Marvelous commissioned S2 they, for whatever reason (I assume Madhouse had become victims of their own brilliance and had too much work - including, I heard, Satoshi Kon\'s new movie) they gave the job to ArtLand. This meant an entirely new crew working on the project, from the artists to the seiyuu (so,...yes, the characters will look and sound different - live with it). Sadly, for whatever reason, ArtLand simply don\'t seem to have the budget to fill the very large shoes left by Madhouse (maybe all is not well at the production house, Marvelous.)Let\'s start off with what\'s wrong. The artwork is generally horrible, especially the \'shakey stills\' used in episode 1\'s fight scenes. That was nasty. However, there does seem to be a gradual improvement up to episode 3, although there still isn\'t enough cash to animate the fight between Pinocchio and Triela properly. (I can only hope that they\'re keeping funds in reserve to throw at the payoff at the end of the story). The backgrounds are good, but I have a sneaky suspicion they\'re merely photos that have been painted over.That said, I want to make one thing very clear: If you\'re watching GSG as an action show, stop watching it now, because you\'ve missed the point. Whatever action there is, is merely the thread that ties the main story - the relationships between the girls and their handlers within the various fratellos - together.Character design is another weakness, as are the voices. Jose\'s terrible hair keeps reminding me of Satou from Welcome to the NHK, and I have no idea who decided to make Henrietta sound so chirpy - it just doesn\'t work. Maybe I\'m nitpicking, but the OP is a bit lame too (although the words have significant meaning) but it\'s never going to be a \'Light Before We Land\'. The ED, however, is about as perfect and suitable as you could get - haunting and evocative and a good replacement for LBWL.So, that said. what are the strengths? Simply put, the story. Anybody who\'s read the manga to this point (Basically starting at Vol 3) should be more than happy with the anime. This is largely (I think) due to the greater input of Aida Yu in both the screenplay and art direction. Given his genius in weaving the overall original story, it can only be a plus that he\'s on board for this series. The opening episode, which rearranged certain events into a more logical chronological order, gave us a good view of the \'goodies\', even all the backroom staff. It\'s just a shame they missed the payoff of the \'walking on the curb\' scene. Ah well. Likewise, episode 2 gave us an insight into the \'baddies\' and expect a lot more film to be used on their stories. The opening, with the youthful Pinocchio, was IMHO better than the manga. Likewise we\'re being given a deeper insight into the workings of the most complex of the fratellos - Hillshire/Triela. Her line ""everything about me is fake"" was not only very insightful from her, but also very sad. Add her newfound insecurity and we\'re in for an interesting time watching this young lady. In terms of storytelling, Season 2 is more than holding its own against its predecessor.Yes, it does have it\'s faults, some of of them are sadly disappointing, especially for a rabid fan of the series like myself. However, if you can look past that you\'ll find there\'s still the same ugly/beautiful/gentle/violent/ light/dark/happy/sad and brilliant story that captured our hearts first time round. yes, the characters will look and sound different - live with it).

However, if you can look past that you\'ll find there\'s still the same ugly/beautiful/gentle/violent/ light/dark/happy/sad and brilliant story that captured our hearts first time round.', ""Having being the first reviewer to actually finish the series, I'd like to say that, despite the obvious reduction in artwork due to changing production studios. They do try their best in trying to stay faithful to the manga. In which they do quite well in my opinion all the way to the final episode.Story - (Great)Basically the main story arc this time around is having the girls try to crack down on a radical terrorist organization. The story is simple enough to cause enough action, drama, and straight up melancholy sadness. Yu Aida does such a good job on the story that theres...a high chance of having the viewer actually feeling sorry for some of the bad guys.Art - (Fair)The art is the obvious difference between the first season and second season. It's almost feels as if a different team was hired to do the art production, and you're 100% right. In all honesty its not the production companies fault that the quality is different. But its painfully obvious that they don't have that 1,000,000Yen per episode backing them. The Art, for the most part does its job not wonderfully, but pretty well. They still manage to hand paint a few landscape pictures of Italy and all its landmarks, they still draw the girls as cute as hell, its all just a little less detailed and polished as before. And you won't see any more brands (other than the guns and a Vespa) floating around. You can also tell money is a big factor in the first few episodes when you can see certain cost cutting techniques like &quot;shaking&quot; a still photo, or slow motion punches. But if you endure to the end you'll manage to see the most exciting episode in the GSG series.Sound - FairSound is another thing that is a mixed bag. All the action and other sound effects fit this show perfectly fine, but the SAME music plays over and over and over again. Once in a while a new song will appear but they go back to the same 3 songs throughout the whole series. But thankfully its not too intrusive, but its noticeable. That was my only issue with the sound. Everything else was just fine.Characters - (Very Good)Now the characters are just as lovable as before,  but it does seem like they emit a little more emotion this time around. I can buy that since they are older and (for the most part) learn things. They do look a little different but that just takes getting used to. We do learn a little more of each of the girls and even get introduced to a new character. I was spoiled with falling in love with the dubbed version of the first season, so I never got a chance to pay attention to the seiyu's from there. But they seem to make the voices fit fine. Moe, tsundere, playful, and smart they all fit just fine in my opinion.Enjoyment - (Good)Overall its just like working at a big call center in America, everything is fine and smooth for the first year, and then you find out that they have to take massive cuts or send your job to India. It's the same job but, just with less money and quality. If you can keep an open mind, you can see they do their best to follow Yu Aida's dream. I sure hope they make Volume 6 (of the manga) into an OVA. a high chance of having the viewer actually feeling sorry for some of the bad guys.Art - (Fair)The art is the obvious difference between the first season and second season.

In the first season, movements were fluid. The girls made firing guns and taking bullets a work of art. Even the few short combat sequences were poetry. But in Il Teatrino, the animators took a still image of a mob attack and shook it. Literally, they shook the image to give the illusion that the people were...beating on each other. And when they let Jose fall in slow motion I knew there was nothing worth watching.The mood of the episode was also entirely different. Somehow, all the heaviness in the first season disappeared, like all of a sudden they were unconcerned by the fact that these girls have such terrible pasts coupled with a very limited lifespan. The girls also suddenly became cheerful, destroying the characters they built in the first season. Rather, they seemed like entirely different people. They've become.. schoolgirls.Another thing I miss about the old Gunslinger is the background music. The first season's BGM carried the mood of each episode, saying &quot;Hey, these ain't just Lolis with guns. These are Lolis with guns and a story to tell.&quot; Comparing the first ep of the second season with the first ep of the first is a no-brainer. The only up-side to the music was Kokia's opening theme. (Yeah, I'm in love with Kokia).All in all, I don't recommend Il Teatrino for anyone - not for fans of the first season because they'll be terribly disappointed, and not for those who've never seen Gunslinger Girl, because they might get a wrong impression of the first season. beating on each other.

I watch a series for the story, honestly the story could be told with stick figures for me, but if the plot was compelling, and the characters believable, then I am sold.On that note, I found the story was more powerful, if less subtle, in this second season, and the same could be said for the characters. This season seemed to focus a bit more on Triela (which I didn't mind, as she was my favourite character) and her personality.What sold me the most about this series...was the amount of depth they went into with Pinocchio. They spend a lot of time developing his character and his past, not to build him up as a villain, but as a person. This is what sets this show apart from the rest. Its a good part of what made great series like Monster and LotGH great, the attention to detail. Having even side characters feel like people, not just props to decorate the background or monsters to be slain.I recommend this series for anyone who enjoys thoughtful storylines with a bit of action. was the amount of depth they went into with Pinocchio.

I am not reviewing how well Il Teatrino follows the manga, I am reviewing the quality and the overall production of Il Teatrino above all else.After a 4 year gap, Il Teatrino, A second season to the original Gunslinger Girl, has been announced.

The story would take place directly after the original Gunslinger Girl, and would follow closely to the manga&rsquo;s premise, rather than the direction the first season.Prerequisite:The big question I asked upon hearing the news was, &ldquo;What production company would be in charge of managing this anime?&rdquo; The previous company in charge of producing Gunslinger Girl was Madhouse, a well known production studio that has released high quality material in the past. Among the ranks of these shows includes, X, Trigun, Paprika, Death Note, Boogiepop Phantom, and most notably Monster. Madhouse has also helped produce some biggest budget animmated movies known to date, and has worked with Studio Ghilbi(Metropolis) All in all, the company has an impressive track record, and is a major hitter in the anime industry, and is trusted to produce shows with respectable quality. As it turns out, Madhouse would not be producing Il Teatrino, so after a few minutes of research I learned the company in charge of Il Teatrino would be Artland.It is important to understand an animation studio&rsquo;s past works are a clear indicator of the quality and type of work they will put out in the future. What a studio has put out before, is synonymous with the material they will put out later, in layman&rsquo;s terms. This is a general rule in anime with rare exceptions. Companies such as Toei is known to produce anime for a generally younger audience and creates anime based on a much larger demographic with less emphasis on art quality. Kyoto animation releases disturbingly high quality art, and is aimed at smaller demographic. The list of anime company trends go on. So if that is the general pattern, how is Artland&rsquo;s Resume?Artland is a relatively small company in terms of influence, and has produced only a few number of anime. There are only two shows I can remember that I truly enjoyed being produced by Artland. The first being Bokura ga Ita, a drama/romance anime with a decent production value. Bokura ga Ita is story driven and relied on minimalist animation. The other being Mushishi, which is considered by many viewers, and myself, to be a masterpiece. Mushishi is arguably one of the best anime of the decade, in all respects: animation, story, atmosphere, and the list goes on. Other productions I have seen by Artland are nowhere near as impressive and some are just downright sub-par in terms of quality. Artland, however, is not a low-quality studio. Artland has only recently restarted producing anime in 2003, after an approximate 20 year gap from the company&rsquo;s last title, Megazone 23, released in 1985. Above anything else, the potential for greatness that lies in this studio, made apparent by the award winning Mushishi, is a good indicator that Il Teatrino has the ability to reach greatness, only if the studio takes the show seriously, and invests some serious time and money into its production.Another important fact to take into consideration is the atmosphere of these two companies will not be similar in anyway. Even before watching the first episode, I knew that the over gritty, dark, and bittersweet atmosphere of the original Gunslinger Girl, would not be apparent in its sequel. After watching the first season of Gunslinger Girl a number of times, and heavily analyzed the first two episode of Il Teatrino; I have come to the conclusion that the second season should act more as a stand alone, manga faithful, adaptation, that just happens to fall after the first season in terms or chronology, than consider it a direct sequel to the original Gunslinger Girl produced by Madhouse. The two shows will not feed of each other, and will not compliment each other in anyway, so why compare them. It&rsquo;s best to watch Il Teatrino with an open mind, and to enjoy the show for what it is.Before we begin discussion of the first episode of Il Teatrino, one must address the original Gunslinger Girl, the predecessor to Gunslinger girl: Il Teatrino. The original can be considered by many to be a cult classic. Out of the thousands of anime that exist in pop culture today only a few truly shine and stand above the rest as a work of art. Gunslinger Girl is truly one of those beautiful rarities that never ceases to amaze, captivate, and cause wonder from the start of the first episode to the last. It is truly a shame that it is not better known, but if it were to gain popularity much of its charm would be lost.Now, to newcomers of anime, the story of Gunslinger Girl is beyond cliche, and the overall idea is laughable. This is understandably so, but I implore you to give it watch. It should be noted the series is emotionally draining. As you go through the series it will be impossible not to make an emotional connection with the characters. The characters are portrayed so vividly, and so beautifully that at times the character has almost too many dimensions causing the viewer to feel confused. Each character has their own foibles, and strengths but there are also so many other elements that are in each character that can not truly be put into words. Most of the conflicts are focused on internal conflicts within each girl and their handlers. If you are curious for more, I suggest you read my review for the original Gunslinger Girl, but enough ranting, it&rsquo;s time to get this show on the road.Note the anime isn&rsquo;t even close to finishing so this acts as a prerequisite reviewArt: Is it a step down from the original? Possibly, it really depends on what you think is good animation, but the quality is without a doubt, comes up short compared to that of Madhouse. This is not necessarily a bad thing however. The show still possesses an amazing amount of charm, and despite the new character designs you can still feel the soul and the spirit of the characters through their dialogue and actions. The landscape&rsquo;s are quite beautiful and the only complaint thus far, is the shaky handy cam effect during the mob scene, but it is acceptable. Overall the art isn&rsquo;t as great, but it&rsquo;s not so bad as to detract away from what makes Gunslinger Girl a great anime.Story: The emotional conflict seen in the first season of the new anime doesn't appear to be rearing it's ugly head yet, but I guarantee it will. After all it is the emotional tensions between the girls and their handlers, and just the inner conflicts inside all the characters themselves that make this anime so great. Hopefully Artland can bring it home and deliver a just sequel to the orignial season.Sound: I am usually not bogged down by change in voice actors, but I&rsquo;m finding it hard to adapt to these new ones, especially Henrietta&rsquo;s, I can&rsquo;t say much here, perhaps we&rsquo;ll grow on them?Characters: As far as I&rsquo;m concerned the characters are still just as strong as before with a new atmosphere and tone. If taken the right direction this new season can deliver just as much impact in character develop as the first season. Here&rsquo;s hoping that the studio can pull through here as characters are what made the first Gunslinger Girl so great.Last Words: When it comes down to it, there is only hoping. I haven&rsquo;t gone too far in the anime, but Gunslinger Girl was one of my all time favorites. I felt an unbearable tug to write a quick review on the first 2 episodes and I did just that. However I felt a sense of bias against this new season, and had a hard time coming up with logical complaints. The bottom line is that the new season may not be as great, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t bad. Yet. first episode was aired.

The final verdict ended up as a /10 for its excellent character elements, well constructed story and well done action. This week we're going to look at the second anime, Il Teatrino. Unlike the first series, this one was handled by Artland, a studio best known for doing support work in projects such as Darker than Black, School Rumble, Star Ocean EX and others. The only thing I've seen where they took the lead was the atrocious to the point of being almost unwatchable, Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao. Of...course, that isn't enough to judge their work as a whole. A lot of prolific studios will work on projects both good and bad. The only way to know is to take a look.This series has a different view of story than the first. The first one was, mostly, stand alone episodes about the girls going on missions. This one has a proper story. The focus is primarily on the girls facing a small cell from a large terrorist group. The missions that the girls embark on are all connected to this small cell and three particularly skilled operatives. There are a few consequences to the change. The first is that they can build up tension a lot more effectively than the first series allowed. Another is that they have proper antagonists in this rather than just random terrorists. This enables them to explore the moral ambiguity more effectively since you acually learn what the terrorists are after and their motivations. This isn't to say that there aren't still problems. Flashbacks get over-used in Il Teatrino. That isn't to say that they aren't effective. Most of them are very good for developing the characters. The problem is that they appear in virtually every episode and take up long segments. Which is really distracting and detracts from the main storyline a bit.The characters continue to be very well done, in fact, this season is an improvement in that regard since the antagonists get fleshed out as characters as well. The girls still have plenty of complexity, good interactions and the back stories get more fleshed out for some of them. Claes continues to be the most adorable killing machine ever. The girls having implied or stated crushes on their handlers continues to be the worst aspect. It's understandable since they are pretty young and these are the only men they spend a lot of time with, but it still gets grating and you'd think a familial bond would be more likely to develop. Although that is arguably the case for some of them. The crush element still takes up far too much focus.The art continues to be very well done, although not as strong in this series. The character designs are pretty much identical, and the same attention to detail went into rendering the various objects used and in the background. The problem lies in the flashbacks. Apparently, they didn't trust the viewers to figure out which moments were flashbacks without some indication, so they made them really grainy and gray. They also use a very strange effect during the final action sequence. An effect which doesn't contribute anything except to make the whole affair confusing to follow and kind of hard to look at. That aside, the action sequences are really good.The voice acting is still really good, with the same exception. There are still a lot of Italian names that the actors consistently mispronounce. I'm not sure if they just didn't bother with pronunciation guides or they decided that the correct pronunciations were too hard. Hearing Mizuno Risa sing Scarborough Fair is still amazing. One thing that is noticeable is that the actors changed between series. On the positive side, the acting team is roughly as good. The music is a bit better in this series. It was effective and well done in the first one, but this one has several moments that stand out musically while the first didn't.The yuri factor is a 3/10. This series has a few more scenes that read as homo-erotic than the first, but it still doesn't have many.My final rating for Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino is a 9/10. It's a worthy successor to the first, and roughly equal in quality. There are some factors that don't work as well, but there are others that are improved upon. I would certainly give this one a watch if you're a fan of the first.Next week, I'll be looking at Sekirei. course, that isn't enough to judge their work as a whole.

The second season is a definitely different turn of events and animation from the first. Some subtle notes are the differences in animation the Girls appear different in shape and form, I think their emotions are much more vivid and painted better then season one.So far, the story seems to be pretty linear with a two sided battle between an extremist group and the government which is where our...child assassins enter in to take care of business. Their isn't any particular occurrence of events rather there is a much deeper psychological focus this time around the girls and some new players who are sure to change things up.To put it lightly, the change in direction from season one can be a good thing, I'm not sure how it will play out at this moment. There is definitely a side of the girls and their handlers we had not had the experience from in season one which is reminiscing in their points of view, particularly the flashbacks which are going to play a vital role in understanding the series. Ill update this review more as the series goes along but that's it for now. child assassins enter in to take care of business.

By the first few minutes of the first episode of season two, I could tell that this was going to be a dumpster fire of a sequel. with the drop in audio quality, the drastic changes to animation and character design, and the overall tone of the show flipped on its head i knew i wasn\'t going to enjoy this show. where the first season put a focus on the girl\'s emotional states explored in an episodic format, the second puts a focus on action scenes in a longer running story arc. with the change to...the character\'s personalities, the voice actor changes were all the more noticeable and jarring. i\'ve heard that the soundtrack isn\'t too terrible but i have a hard time believing that based off of how much i\'ve seen and how awful everything else is. especially the foley. i\'ve seen too many reviews making excuses for this show because of the studio change. stuff about how ""they just didn\'t have the funds that madhouse did."" funds are not what make a show great. a team of passionate staff and animators are what make a show great. studio artland used this sequel as a cash grab to pull in fans of the first. but even with that they were sloppy. they didn\'t understand what made the first season so absolutely beautiful. they didn\'t look at the deeper themes and story elements and character personality. they didn\'t look at the subtle differences in the girls and how they interacted with their partners. they saw cute young girls with guns and just turned them into boring, trite, anime stereotypes. it also doesn\'t seem like many people actually know how MAL\'s rating system works. this isn\'t high school. 7/10 is not average. 5/10 is average. i keep seeing 8\'s and 9\'s given in reviews where the writer wasn\'t even that impressed and admitted they saw huge flaws in the show itself. the character\'s personalities, the voice actor changes were all the more noticeable and jarring. i\'ve heard that the soundtrack isn\'t too terrible but i have a hard time believing that based off of how much i\'ve seen and how awful everything else is. especially the foley. i\'ve seen too many reviews making excuses for this show because of the studio change. stuff about how ""they just didn\'t have the funds that madhouse did."" funds are not what make a show great. a team of passionate staff and animators are what make a show great. studio artland used this sequel as a cash grab to pull in fans of the first. but even with that they were sloppy. they didn\'t understand what made the first season so absolutely beautiful. they didn\'t look at the deeper themes and story elements and character personality. they didn\'t look at the subtle differences in the girls and how they interacted with their partners. they saw cute young girls with guns and just turned them into boring, trite, anime stereotypes. it also doesn\'t seem like many people actually know how MAL\'s rating system works. this isn\'t high school. 7/10 is not average. 5/10 is average. i keep seeing 8\'s and 9\'s given in reviews where the writer wasn\'t even that impressed and admitted they saw huge flaws in the show itself.', 'hi all this is my first review so be gentle with meLet me just start by saying that this is one of the few sequels that manage to outshine the original although not many will agree with me. The reason is because there is the existence of clear thinking and planing involved with this anime that I did not find in the previous. majority of the viewers will commonly complain about the difference in artwork however you should watch this anime as a standalone from the original much like how similar Death Note and Code Geass is but you dont watch them as the same...thing neither do you watch gunslinger girls and gunslinger girls II as the same thing. They do have the same cast however the original is more of a get to know our character kind of anime where as the second is less of get to know the characters and more of we\'re gonna throw them into a situation and see what happens kind of thing. The artwork will downgrade if your watching the first one then coming to watch the second however there will be more details later on. Let it be known that you do not need to watch gunslinger girls to understand what\'s happening although knowing the background is helpful.First let me explain my rating system as it will be very different from the rating system that are often employed by others. it is out of a total of 100 points and plot and story is worth 50, character is worth 30, sound is worth 10 and art is also worth 10. The reason that plot and character are worth so much is because it is the defining difference between good stories and bad ones. anime, mangas, books, movies can only be successful if they have a successful story. The reason art and sound is worth so little is because it is possible to make a successful story without it and people have and they are often published as written books.story: 45/50The story is very good given that there are some parts were just mostly flashbacks they weren\'t completely worthless unlike some flashbacks found in other animes. The story revolves around the theme of revenge. As common a theme to center a plot around, this anime was successful in pulling off making a great anime centered around this theme. The story is the biggest factor that kept me watching as many times during my grind through the original, I find myself wanting to drop it since almost each episode is a story arc with minimal connection to the previous episode however Gunslinger Girls II is different as there is only 1 main story arc and will keep you watching waiting to find out what\'s next. I cannot really give much more without spoiling the anime so i\'ll just leave it at that. A good thing to do is watch the entire thing from start to finish without taking a break as it will be alot better that way.character: 30/30This is where this anime really shines. Every important character is given a chance to show their true nature and some of them even had their history and background showed. Unlike many anime of this length with such a huge cast, the creates really thought through who was important and who wasn\'t and decided to focus on the important characters instead of trying to focus on everyone. Though both approach works, i personally like the approach where the ""main"" characters are highly focused where the ""supporting"" characters are more or less ignored. However it is hard to feel this way about the characters without first seeing the original gunslinger girls.Sound: 7/10I really cant say much here. I\'m not a music person. All I can say is if I like it or  not and this time i\'d say it feels right but not memorable.Art: 6/10This is actually an area that I am most knowledgeable with as I have produced animations in 2D and 3D before. The artwork is a real let down as the first episode has alot of still frames. Judging from looks, the producers started making the anime from somewhere farther back than from the first episode and probably ended on the first episode. I say this because when your nearing the ending of a project the work (at least in my experience) starts falling short of the mark. In doing this the over all feel of the artwork is greatly affected. However as you continue watching the anime, the artwork greatly improves and the fights are animated rather than still frames. My rule of thumb is if your watching and your not feeling like that your looking at a photograph then the animation passed. However on closer inspection there are many times where you truly are just looking at a still image being slid across the screen. This is where good sound engineering is able to make up for it. For the sake of comparison though, Gunslinger Girls II is much lower quality than the original Gunslinger Girls so if you watch anime because of the artwork then this is definitely not for you.over all:45/5030/307/10+6/10--------88/100roughly 9/10Overall I enjoyed Gunslinger Girls II better than the original Gunslinger Girls. You do not need to watch the original to understand what\'s happening here however it is very helpful to know the characters as there isn\'t a giant introduction to the characters in this anime.Hopefully my review made sense as this is my first. Thank you for reading. thing neither do you watch gunslinger girls and gunslinger girls II as the same thing. They do have the same cast however the original is more of a get to know our character kind of anime where as the second is less of get to know the characters and more of we\'re gonna throw them into a situation and see what happens kind of thing. The artwork will downgrade if your watching the first one then coming to watch the second however there will be more details later on. Let it be known that you do not need to watch gunslinger girls to understand what\'s happening although knowing the background is helpful.First let me explain my rating system as it will be very different from the rating system that are often employed by others. it is out of a total of 100 points and plot and story is worth 50, character is worth 30, sound is worth 10 and art is also worth 10. The reason that plot and character are worth so much is because it is the defining difference between good stories and bad ones. anime, mangas, books, movies can only be successful if they have a successful story. The reason art and sound is worth so little is because it is possible to make a successful story without it and people have and they are often published as written books.story: 45/50The story is very good given that there are some parts were just mostly flashbacks they weren\'t completely worthless unlike some flashbacks found in other animes.

Thank you for reading.', 'story: continuation of section 2 fighting the five republics.art: more cutesy from the first season. are all drwan up diffenrtly.sound: different from the first season. different feel. wonderful openingcharacter: new antagonist.enjoyment: it take you along with the feel of section 2 getting good grasp against the fight with the five republics which was different from the first season.overall: was completely different from what was to be expected from the thought of a second season but was good still nonetheless. noting to be disappointed about at all. ', ""OK so when I played episode 1 of Il Teatrino, my eyes widened in disbelief in the obvious downgrade in art, I thought I was reliving the “Saiyuki Debacle” all over again: the change in character designs, the animation was sub-par and the voice acting and the character portrayals were way different. If it weren't for the names of the characters and the continuation of the storyline, one would never guess the the two series were related....and that's probably what saved this series. The fact that visual differences between the part1 and part 2 of this series were so stark that you had no choice...but to break from any attachments you had from the first installment of Gunslinger Girl, and take in this second part for what it is.~ArtThe art is really NOT THAT bad, right? Yes it IS a downgrade from the first season but I've tried looking at it for it's own merit [it was hard, considering I watch anime in marathon-like fashion and watched both parts back 2 back]. It was obvious with this second piece, no one had actually been to Italy, there was no great attention given to background scenery, of the cityscapes or the coastlines. No cobblestones, no marble surfaces, no fancy artwork reproductions or detailed sculptures. But there were some great backdrops like the vineyard scenes which was pretty nice to look at [....but that's not uniquely Italian, it could be France or California or more than likely from some textbook or postcard]. Actually most of the scenery could have been acquired from postcards, and such – at one point I'm pretty sure they put the Coliseum in the background [I think the riot scene] just random stereotypical Italian landmarks you can get from any picture from the web and reproduce.The animation wasn't too fabulous either, lots of the little usual shortcuts taken here and there: frozen image with sliding cell [this time they kinda shook the image around and played with the focus a little bit], A few unnecessary slo-mo shots and/or close ups which some might be fooled to think it for dramatic purposes....but it's really to economize on the animation [so they don't have to draw more frames or more than one character during a fight scene.] All of that being said, it's still in the middle as far as art style and animation goes, I've seen better and I've seen far worse.~SoundsHere's it's were it's kind tricky for me, because I don't know if it's the voice cast's fault or the scripting or the direction they were given, but this time around the “girls” were a little too glib. Henrietta, Triela, Rico and all the rest. I think the first part of Gunslinger Girl got their personalities right, they should be FAR more somber and conflicted than they appear in the 2nd season [even though apparently some time has passed since then]. The 1st part really captured their essences and explored their true depths and complexities and it really showed in the entire work as a result.  For example, Henrietta was far more timid and unsteady in the first one than she is portrayed in the second one or Rico who is undoubtedly the most “child-like” of all the assassins had a very clueless way about her [the kind of clueless you get from being sequestered for too long or from being on drugs or brainwashed] but by the time of the the second part...she just appears dumb, in the typical “anime airhead” style....does anyone else pick up on that?What I'm saying is the voice actors did well, but they ran through it like any other regular anime, but I'm sure if given a chance to act on CSI or one of those James Bond or Bourne Identity type of movies...they would have read the scripts quite differently [and that's how they should have read the scripts here for THIS anime].The music for this series was on the generic side, perhaps even lackluster. I'm vaguely familiar with the first song used in the OP, so more than likely they've played it on the anime radios a few times, but really neither this song nor the ED theme song did much for me...and what was the point of using Scarborough Fair? IMHO, that was just to include it for the sake of boosting the value of the soundtrack and making it seem as meaningful and viable as the first one.~StoryThe story was the strongest asset for Il Teatrino, considering that it's a continuation from the original Gunslinger Girl, but again you have to be the sort that's into political intrigue and warring factions otherwise it might just bore you. For me it wasn't boring at all, it still had a lot of the intelligence that the first part had...and again it reminded me of Ghost in the Shell in that way.It wasn't a particularly fast-paced story and just as with the first part it was basically 50/50; 50% action and 50% exposition. I think what can really help a person get into the story a little better would be to watch the OVAs before beginning the second part, because it was kind of rough for me to figure out what key political positions some people played, or what understand the various factions. For me, when someone says “right-wing” or “far-left” I kind of revert to American politics and try to use that as the political template, most of the time it works but sometimes I'm not sure if that's how they meant it.~CharactersA lot of the issues I mentioned with the characters, I've already stated in the [Sounds] section. I think that they kinda rounded off the main characters and chucked them to the side to focus on Franco, Flanca/Katerina and Pinocchio....which is nice but I would have liked to see that level of depth applied to all the characters, know what I mean? Like Katerina and Pinocchio behaved like REAL people with all their complexities and flawed glory, you kinda didn't get that vibe from , say, Rico [I mention Rico because from just part two, you might think she's an airhead, but if you watched the first part or the OVAs then you see that she very much struggles, like all the girls,  having to adjust to being a child assassin or being regarded as just a machine accessory]. And Henrietta who's personal struggles seem to have evaporated and all she deals with now is this relentless crush on Josue...which could easily be translated into a shoujo-type storyline.Despite how the overall tone of my review might appear, I actually DID like the character designs, tho! I like the fact that they didn't try to mimic the character designs of the first Gunslinger Girl, they just worked a whole other look. Which was good. They looked very similar to the characters from Fate/Stay Night, Saber, Rin and Triela are very similar in appearance [naturally, look beyond the height and strip away the coloring. Very similar character design...probably done by the same person]~VerdictIt's still definitely worth watching and owning. but to break from any attachments you had from the first installment of Gunslinger Girl, and take in this second part for what it is.~ArtThe art is really NOT THAT bad, right?

It constantly tries to add layers of development across all these different factions and tries to tie it\'s story together like it\'s a Deus Ex game. But none of the plots that go...down at the same time is fleshed out, they are all really transparent and just plain boring to watch.The art get\'s a lot of hate, and I can understand that. The first season had that distinct Madhouse look to it, and despite being just flat out cheap in some places, it managed to be somewhat appealing. But what Marvelous Entertainment brought to the table can be explained simply by using the words Anime standard. What kind of pissed me off was how they completely changed the feel of some characters, specifically Hilshire. In the first season, he looked like a man in his late 30\'s maybe early 40\'s, now he just looks like a 20yo anime guy. The other thing that really get\'s on my nerves is some of their ""subtle animation"", like when there is a flashback, the screen zooms in, and turns sepia. The last thing I managed to notice is their use of still imagery, with the bunch of effects layered on top, to save cost. It\'s not that big of a deal, and I can understand why they used it, but it still managed to add to my annoyment.The characters. Well, nothing much changed about the original cast. But they actually introduced few new ones just for the sake of it, and my god, they are flatter thanpaper.Well, how do I wrap this shitstain of a review up? The first season was by no means a masterpiece, but it had few interesting concepts, and it managed to explore some of them fairly well, even tho the overall package was bit underwhelming, it was interesting and entertaining enough to keep me going. This season, on the other hand, was stock standard. It wasn\'t offensive, but it was painfully boring and it dragged on so much I just couldn\'t bring myself to finish it. Some people got a kick out of it just for the simple reason of ""girlz wit gunz""but not me. down at the same time is fleshed out, they are all really transparent and just plain boring to watch.The art get\'s a lot of hate, and I can understand that.

Story lines felt rushed and others felt pointless with how little time the show has. I found myself rooting more for the ""bad guys"" by the end and perhaps that was the point, but I doubt it.The pseudo rivalry of Triela and Pinocchio was enjoyable, however nether had much of a reason to want to kill the other, other than they\'ve been indoctrinated into being murderers. I just find this anime so at odds with itself. It felt like it was trying to be something out of Key with how it\'s framed and scored; the...drama of the girls daily life, the way they act when they\'re not killing people. This in tandem with this nightmare world of a corrupt government, child solders and morally gray terrorist groups. We never get enough info on anything to take a proper side, perhaps that\'s the point or perhaps it wasn\'t the thesis of the anime at all. It just felt like a jumbled mess of ideas. Ideas I would like on their own or if they had more time to flesh out, but as it stands it felt sloppy. Once again, I really wanted to like it, but It never really clicked past ""I like that car in real life"" or ""that\'s a neat gun"" drama of the girls daily life, the way they act when they\'re not killing people.

Once again, I really wanted to like it, but It never really clicked past ""I like that car in real life"" or ""that\'s a neat gun""', 'I guess I might as well start off by saying that this review won\'t be liked by a good number of fans who loved the first season of Gunslinger Girl and hated the vast number of changes that Il Teatrino made to the original. Having seen and loved season one myself, I will concede that it was a better adaptation in every department. However, to leave it at that does the series a great injustice.The biggest flaw Il Teatrino struggles with throughout all 13 episodes, to the point where some action scenes are really hampered, is quite poor animation. I\'m hardly an expert when it...comes to anime, and I can\'t speak to Artland\'s other productions, but it really gets in the way of the storytelling. Now personally, I judge an anime\'s artistic value as more than pure animation, and this provides a good example. See, the show still remains remarkably faithful to Yu Aida\'s manga, and a great many scenes are artistically painted, and even some of the additions they made in the form of motifs and symbols are quite beautiful. Of course the poor animation wounds all this. But don\'t let that stop you from trying Il Teatrino unless the only thing you care about is seamless production.Sound-wise, Il Teatrino is a bit of a mixed bag. Another popular complaint is that they changed every voice actor in the original dub for the sequel (at least in the original Japanese dub, so you\'re in luck if you like the English dub), and while that\'s a shame, none of the original cast stuck out that much. I do have a few minor complaints about their new casting (I\'m looking at you, Rico), but overall they\'re quite competent. The characteristic classical soundtrack in the original is amiss, but it\'s been replaced with largely satisfying piano interludes that are actually tied into the character relationships pretty uniquely. The only downside is that one theme in particular gets quite stale, so take of it what you will. Kokia\'s ""Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi"" does a great job in the OP as well.Where Il Teatrino really makes up for all it\'s admitted shortcomings is in both character development and storytelling. Gone is the rather immature storytelling in the original where villains were new every episode and never stood a chance. Il Teatrino does an exceptional job of painting a much clearer, intelligent plot line throughout. The original series gained strength with each major character background it wove into the plot; the sequel only really has one more such origin to tell with Triela, but boy is it a doozie. Just like the first Gunslinger Girl, don\'t get too involved if you\'re faint of heart, but the reward is immense if you aren\'t.Unfortunately, this is also where many fans of just the first anime will protest. For while it did so tastefully, the first season rearranged the events in the manga liberally to provide an emotional ending. Without spoiling anything, fans who only watched the anime were basically mislead to think a certain main character died. So her unapologetic return understandably raises some eyebrows. Now, in my opinion, Il Teatrino is really doing the only thing it can; for a series so faithful to the manga, it can\'t just retcon at will.Narrow-minded fans looking for a pure sequel to the first Gunslinger Girl and nothing else won\'t take easily to Il Teatrino. New fans, as well as fans of the manga and those willing to accept a different interpretation, should take to the emotional literature, heartwarming relationships and philosophical desperation much better. In other words, Il Teatrino isn\'t for everyone. And while the original may never be equaled, Yu Aida has here a story worth telling by any means necessary.Above all, this is a series about humanity; I, for one, forgive it for showing a few humanistic flaws. comes to anime, and I can\'t speak to Artland\'s other productions, but it really gets in the way of the storytelling.

It is true that this show is in all ways inferior to the first season, but the first season was exemplary, and the second still seems quite good to me.  I guess some people have a low tolerance for disapointment.  While I don't like ArtLand's animation style or interpretation of the characters as much, I feel that doesn't detract from the greatness of the original, and the second season's story is still enjoyable in its own right.The...low point of the second season is the score, which is very inconsistent.  The opening and the ending are actually quite good, and some of the background music is of similar orchestration and quality, but in some ways that makes the bad bits all the more jarring.  It's not the sort of music that would feel out of place in some low-budget cyberpunk anime or late 90s video game, but it really doesn't fit with this series.  Hopefully this will make ArtHouse's list of things to improve as the season progresses. low point of the second season is the score, which is very inconsistent.

It's not the sort of music that would feel out of place in some low-budget cyberpunk anime or late 90s video game, but it really doesn't fit with this series.  Hopefully this will make ArtHouse's list of things to improve as the season progresses."", '(First off, each season of Gunslinger Girl is only 13 episodes long. I don\'t know why it says 9001 here...)This show, including its first season, had the opportunity to do many things really well.It could have been a heartbreaking/warming story of the humanity of its ""cyborg"" characters and their relationships with their handlers.It could have been about the humanity shared on both sides by terrorists, assassins, and government agents.It could have been simply a badass show about assassinations and bodyguarding.Best of all, it had the potential to do all of the above blended into something spectacular.Unfortunately, it falls short...of achieving anything remarkable by not quite ever developing its characters or story due to how much it tries to do in such a short episode count.The one thing I really appreciate about Gunslinger Girl is that it never fails to make you feel a little sick to your stomach whenever you see one of the girls holding a firearm. of achieving anything remarkable by not quite ever developing its characters or story due to how much it tries to do in such a short episode count.The one thing I really appreciate about Gunslinger Girl is that it never fails to make you feel a little sick to your stomach whenever you see one of the girls holding a firearm.', 'I really wanted to give this season a fair chance, and after being pretty disappointed with the first episode, I decided to give this season up to episode three to sell me on its strengths, unfortunately I could not live up to my own standards and dropped this season after just two.From the get go, the art is changed, and in no way is it an improvement. A lot of use of shaking stills, animation became less fluid, and the biggest change in my opinion, is the overall style. The first season\'s atmosphere is lost through the style change, the girls all look like they...aged in reverse and have become overly moe-fied. If you enjoyed the first season for its bleak atmosphere (I know I did, it had me hooked), you will be disappointed.Another attributing factor to this is the way the character interactions have changed. There is no subtlety or real weight behind them to make them feel meaningful, every time a relationship is emphasized, it is done in a very ""in you face"" manner, they felt manufactured. This stripped the characters of the soul they had in the first season.These were the two major issues I had going into this new season, and are the two aspects that had me so entertained by the first season. Without them, this feels like an entirely different series to its predecessor (and if you want to enjoy this season, it is probably best you try going into it with that mindset. Don\'t expect the characters\' interactions or atmosphere to be the same)Of course, I am basing this all off the first two episodes, but I just could not follow through.

Carried lots of hope and expectations from how good first season was. And I was a bit turned down by this season.Story: 8/10Actually, this season\'s story is pretty good since it\'s developed from the first season. Changed some point of view and deepened the story details from first season. It can make a perfect season but that\'s not what creator seems to present it to us.Production/Directing: 6/10From the first season, the director did a very nice job on directing. Great presenting, scene picturing and give us the perfect mood he want to present from...the story. Technique he used to present was very good and can makes watchers really enjoy the series. BUT in this season, it\'s totally different. Director try to put everything into watchers head to make them excited but he puts too much. That\'s makes watchers get bored, this arc still not continue, why begin new arc? And then he leave the second arc unfinished like that and present another arc. And what\'s the most important is how he present the story. His presenting technique was dull, no tactic at all. He try to make a mystery and try to hint it to watchers but he hinted too much. And he did this with the whole story. But in the good side, the story seems to be able to understand easily. Softcore watchers can enjoy it as well. So it\'ll be 6 for producing.Art: 7/10Everything is better in second season about graphics. Especially, Drawings. All characters drawings is very good. But animation and character\'s action is too unnatural and feels wrong. In some action scenes, It\'s really annoying me about how they move around so careless in enemy territory or how they hold their gun. Sometimes when they needs accurate shot, they hold the gun using only one hand, in the same time those who only shoot suppressing shots hold the gun and aim nicely but only hit trees and rocks. But overall graphics seems good to me so 7 is a proper score.Sound: 10/10Now quit depressing and gets some praise. Every musics and original soundtrack in this season is PERFECT. Actually, I start watching this series because of ending song of second season that composed by legendary song composer and story writer, Maeda Jun, sang by legendary singer, Lia. After listened to it first time, only understand 60-70% of lyrics(I didn\'t looked at Eng lyrics) but I loved this song already. One of my favorite anime song ever. Original Soundtrack is SUPERB. Every songs filled with feelings from composer. Especially, I like ""Main Theme"" the most. I like how it\'s develops mood from zero to highest, step by step. 10 is not too much for sound of this season.Character: 8/10Yeah, character design and planning is perfect. Everything was planned by the story writer which all ruined by the director of the second season. The things that most important of a character in a story is his/her personality which based on his/her past and experience. Personality is not easily changed. Personality will slowly changed from character\'s environment that makes them change or a very important incident that changed his/her way of thinking. Enough technical matter, let\'s continue. The director made the personality of second season\'s character changed too often without reason. He just did it because it\'ll fit to the story he want to present. That\'s why I give it 7 but the original character was perfect so I lifted the score to 8.Enjoyment: 8/10Enjoyment is really a personal opinion. For me I enjoyed it\'s story so much. I feel moved by this series story. And I enjoy every music in this second season. But yeah, back to blame the director. I feels a bit down because of how the director present the story. Makes it less enjoyable. So 8 must be a proper score.Overall: 8/10This series is enjoyable. You can watch it and enjoy this series. If you\'re not expect much about directing that is. For me, I wrote short film story before and I made lots of short films so I knows lots of technical things that needs to be done in making a film. When I saw someone did it wrong, it\'s definitely makes me feels annoyed by natural. But I really enjoy this anime so I\'ll give it 8.English is not my first language so there may be some grammatically mistakes, sorry for that.

In this season of the series, the SWA come into conflict with a pair of bombers working for the Five Republics Faction and a skilled assassin within the organization named Pinocchio. The latter comes to be a problem for cyborg Triela, who loses to Pinocchio in an encounter and wishes to avenge said loss. There were also two additional OVA episodes made for the series adapting side-stories from the manga’s sixth volume that explore elements of the pasts of the Croce brothers, Jean and Jose, who serve as cyborg...handlers for the SWA for Rico and Henrietta respectively.Before I offer my thoughts on plot and characters with Il Teatrino, I should address the controversial element of the series in regards of its visual presentation. Unlike Madhouse, Artland isn’t so memorable with high production quality for many of their titles and this shows with Il Teatrino. Details for characters and scenery are simplified and animation isn’t as smooth to see in action for combat scenes compared to the first series. I certainly recall this being a turn-off for many fans 14 years ago when the series originally premiered in Japan with the jarring difference in production quality, and I can’t really argue with the animation quality for Il Teatrino taking a big hit.If you can look past the subpar visual presentation, Il Teatrino offers up perhaps the best developments within Gunslinger Girl as it features ongoing plot development with the SWA’s conflict with members of the Five Republics Faction. This series crosses into political thriller territory as it thoroughly explores the motives and actions of both the SWA and the Five Republics with the justifications members of both factions have. This not only shows that characters within both factions have their redeemable qualities to justify their actions, but also shows the societal ramifications that the actions of both organizations can have with government corruption and the damage that terrorist acts can have on major buildings and the populace.Besides the political thriller, Il Teatrino also takes the time to explore the pasts of a number of characters throughout the series and explore how these developments shaped their views of Italian society and terrorism. For the SWA, there is a good deal of focus on exploring the pasts of the handlers in this season and how this effects their outlooks on the work they are doing, this getting unique focus with how one handler’s work effects a romantic relationship he has outside of it. The exploration of the origins of Triela and Pinocchio in this season also provide some interesting parallels with both their tragic pasts, how both each view their work, and the relationships each have with their parental figure within the organizations each represent in the show’s main conflict.Putting aside its subpar presentation, Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino is still a strong continuation of Gunslinger Girl that offers some ongoing plot developments that push the series into political thriller territory and offers more exploration of the back stories and beliefs of a number of characters within both factions. handlers for the SWA for Rico and Henrietta respectively.Before I offer my thoughts on plot and characters with Il Teatrino, I should address the controversial element of the series in regards of its visual presentation.

But if you\'ve read the manga and can look past the low production quality, then you\'ll probably have more respect and patience for this show. But overall, there are so many things that get in the way of making a decent show, and that goes beyond just the animation and audio budget. In my opinion, the show didn\'t make good use of the limited time it had.Lack of FocusA lot all of characters have conflicts that I felt didn\'t receive adequate time to...develop. The biggest conflict was suppose to be between Triela and a character named Pinocchio, but they had to compete with other characters and the overall plot for screen time. In the end, their final interaction didn\'t hit as hard to me, because I didn\'t really get to see Triela or Pinocchio grow over time -- it happens mainly in the background.Less Attention on the Girls & their HandlersThe most interesting part of Gunslinger Girl for me was the gun-slinging girls, the effects ""conditioning"" has on them, and their relationship with their handlers. In S2, they felt more robotic and watered-down. Rico is the best example of this point. In S2, all she does is kill for the most part and she even seems to enjoy it. Compare her to S1, EP 3\'s Rico, who had to kill a boy she befriended briefly. Her feelings were far more complex in that one episode than they are in the entirety of S2.When it comes to the handlers, they\'re a lot more gentle on the girls. In S1, they could get frustrated, angry, etc. When handlers like Marco felt guilty after scolding their girls and apologized to them in their unique ways, those moments felt really satisfying.ConclusionI\'m not an anime critic, I\'m usually easily entertained. I\'ve also never written a review before on MAL, but my experience with S2 pushed me to do this. There\'s so much that I liked about the first season of this anime and there\'s so much that I want to say. The character design, music, and animation was beautiful. The tone of the show was dark and gritty, but it could be peaceful and wholesome when it needed to be. On top of that, it had such iconic and memorable moments.S1, EP 11, when Henrietta chased after that purse snatcher, it was more than just some random action scene. It was a showcase of her love and devotion to Jose. She would\'ve chased that man to the ends of the earth just to get that camera back, that\'s how much Jose means to her. In my opinion, nothing comes close to moments like that in S2, regardless of budget. develop.

The changes itself are both good and bad. I liked the fact that this one focused more on the story and world building however i didn't like how the epic music of S1 was practically non existent here. I preferred the animation in S2 than S1 but this is really a minor preference. Now it has the same issues as S1. Despite changing directors. the series about robotic cyborg girls that are assassin/hitman are still somehow boring. The issue with S2 is...that they waste too much time on characters that no one really gives a shit about. as such I enjoyed the beginning episodes and the later episodes but the stuff in the middle was somewhat of a wreck. The story is really mostly about the cyborgs vs the terrorist. Pinnochio was a decent villian and i liked his backstory. Though not when they kept showing it again and again. None of the other villians were charismatic and such the fact they basically wasted 3 episodes on them is a real waste. The series should've stuck with its strong suit which is the relationship between the Girls and there handlers. Henrietta especially expression and emotion is outstanding but she's barely in this season. Overall i think it was slow just like the first. There are new issues but there are also improvements in the first season. And though episode 13 was baller it just not enough for me to say this series is a must watch6/10. that they waste too much time on characters that no one really gives a shit about. as such I enjoyed the beginning episodes and the later episodes but the stuff in the middle was somewhat of a wreck.

Things that ""should"" have been explored, considering the premise and setup, but weren\'t. This is because the show ends at volume 5, while the manga is 15 volumes long.The animation quality takes a nosedive sometimes, especially early on in season 2, like during car chase scenes. Season 2 also commits the sin of overusing flashbacks.My guess is that the studio ran out of resources and/or time during production, so they cut...a lot of corners in the visual department and ultimately didn\'t finish the story.The anime\'s strength is in the writing and character dynamics. You empathise with the characters, or at least want to know where the plot takes them.Season 2 doesn\'t rush through character arcs as quickly as season 1, but still dedicates entire episodes to secondary characters or specific character developments. Season 2 also introduces a major villain, but tries very hard to make you not want to see the villain lose, similar to how season 1 focused on making everyone morally dubious or pitiful in some way.Even if the anime sadly doesn\'t show you the full story, it definitely makes you want to know how it ends. If the goal was to make you want to read the manga, then it is a success I guess.Overall, Gunslinger Girl season 2 is just more of the same.

Alas, it has to be the sequel/semi-reboot of 2003\'s seminal Gunslinger Girl Season 1. Unfortunately dragged down by its desperate attempt to appeal to a wider ""anime"" audience, Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino falls significantly short as a sequel.Baseline quality: 8/10. Weighed down by blatant Moe elements.Pros:+more colorful and more advanced shading technology+solid characterization in certain episodes+Overall faithfulness to the source material which revels in understatement...+Pinocchio\'s arc and Frank/Franco\'s arc+Certain adaptation choices showcase the studio\'s talent, especially adding Scarborough Fair as the theme to that Claes episode.Cons:-tonally off, especially in EP1 and in interactions between cyborg girls and handlers.-downplays the gloomy side of girls\' life and humanity which was the core success factor in S1.-Falls prey to the trendy 2000s stylistic choices which are not only dated but also subpar to S1.-Not nearly as empathetic as the original season.This season could be a textbook case for why the subtlest changes in art direction can ruin a show. I am not even kidding here.If you are a huge fan of S1, I won\'t blame you for wanting to drop S2 after watching S2E1. EP1, which serves as a semi-reboot/reintroduction to the story and characters, feels like a betrayal to everything S1 stands for.The cyborg girls now fight in an oddly cheerful and weightless fashion, in stark contrast to Season 1\'s hardboiled realism. The girls and their handlers (now for some reason look younger and cuter) now constantly make Sailor-Moonish googly eyes at each other. There is no mention at all about the shortened lifespan of cyborg girls, and Angelica, coming off the masterful ending sequence of S1, now is oddly back in action (yes I know S2 might be more faithful to the original manga in certain ways, including the fate of Angelica, but it ruined the most iconic sequence in S1).Laughable shaky cam sequences and shots lingering on cutesy stuff, as if silently shouting ""THIS IS A ROMCOM with cyborg girls killing people for some reason"". Judging by EP1 alone, I would give it a ""facepalm/10"". These issues were partially alleviated in later episodes, as EP2-3, EP5-6 showed us what this show can be when it is trying to reconcile with the tone of S1 in steadier hands. But the overtly corny and cutesy tone never entirely went away. While Season 1 mostly maintains a surgeon-like professional indifference/sense of distance and allows the audience to emote/resonate with the characters using their own imagination, S2 spoon-feeds anime tropes to the audience (e.g. making Triela explicitly a tsundere, making the handlers younger to make the potential romance a bit ""more acceptable""). Not to mention the OP with random cel-shaded photos of real-life Italy. S2\'s OP song is not bad on its own, but again it gives the impression of a typical high-school rom-com which causes tonal-narrative dissonance for the show.It\'s as if the producers of the show said ""Season 1 is way too mature, dark and poignant for mainstream audiences, let\'s make S2 a dream come true for otakus"". By the lack of a Season 3 some 13 years later (now in 2021), this desperate marketing strategy probably did not work too well. And we are left with a sequel struggling with an acute case of identity crisis.To be fair, not all the blames should go to the studio that made Season 2. The original manga\'s phase covered in this season (Vol. 3-5 and half of Vol. 6) is often times not as compelling as that of S1. Season 1\'s ending, one of the most powerful and melancholic endings in any artform--where Angelica slowly fades away listening to Marco retelling her favorite fairy tale, while other girls sang Ode to Joy under the meteor rain, is partially to blame here as well. As powerful as Madhouse\'s adaptation (bringing forward Angelica\'s death/reconciliation with Marco and make it concurrent with the Ode to Joy sequence) is, it makes telling more Angelica-centered story in later seasons redundant. Season 1 mastered the art of understatement and subtlety, turning the manga\'s brutal story (which is best served cold) into a calm humanizing story that powerfully protests against political-ideology-driven atrocities. That is a testament to Madhouse Studio\'s almost unmatched adaptation prowess. I further realized that after reading the original manga. In a way, S2 resembles the manga\'s style and pacing more than S1, but that exposed shortcomings of the manga rather than improving upon them. For example, S1\'s Henrietta is closer to a ""killer doll"" than her appearance in S2 (and that in the manga). I am arguing this is a deliberate artistic choice instead of ""poor animation/art"".  As the story progresses, the audience gradually figures out the meaning behind the song ""The Light Before We Land"" along with why the OP sequence heavily features Henrietta (including her doll-like cry/smile/leap). As one finishes S1, one would be inclined to reflect on their own limited time in this life, as well as how they treat their family/loved ones. Because if these hardened and stern handlers working for a most cruel bureaucracy can treasure and reconcile with their meteor-like cyborg girls, why cannot we do the same with people around us? These themes might not be so fleshed out in the manga or S2, especially since S2 downplayed the inevitable and ever-heavier final fate of the girls. After finishing S2 and 2 OVAs, I did not feel like I have gained new insights into the characters. The final scene (Jose and Jean went to swim with bikini-wearing Henrietta and Rico) just feels weird.Despite all that, S2, for the most part, solidly and faithfully delivered the manga\'s story. +Pinocchio\'s arc and Frank/Franco\'s arc+Certain adaptation choices showcase the studio\'s talent, especially adding Scarborough Fair as the theme to that Claes episode.Cons:-tonally off, especially in EP1 and in interactions between cyborg girls and handlers.-downplays the gloomy side of girls\' life and humanity which was the core success factor in S1.-Falls prey to the trendy 2000s stylistic choices which are not only dated but also subpar to S1.-Not nearly as empathetic as the original season.This season could be a textbook case for why the subtlest changes in art direction can ruin a show.

These issues were partially alleviated in later episodes, as EP2-3, EP5-6 showed us what this show can be when it is trying to reconcile with the tone of S1 in steadier hands. But the overtly corny and cutesy tone never entirely went away. While Season 1 mostly maintains a surgeon-like professional indifference/sense of distance and allows the audience to emote/resonate with the characters using their own imagination, S2 spoon-feeds anime tropes to the audience (e.g. making Triela explicitly a tsundere, making the handlers younger to make the potential romance a bit ""more acceptable""). Not to mention the OP with random cel-shaded photos of real-life Italy. S2\'s OP song is not bad on its own, but again it gives the impression of a typical high-school rom-com which causes tonal-narrative dissonance for the show.It\'s as if the producers of the show said ""Season 1 is way too mature, dark and poignant for mainstream audiences, let\'s make S2 a dream come true for otakus"". By the lack of a Season 3 some 13 years later (now in 2021), this desperate marketing strategy probably did not work too well. And we are left with a sequel struggling with an acute case of identity crisis.To be fair, not all the blames should go to the studio that made Season 2. The original manga\'s phase covered in this season (Vol. 3-5 and half of Vol. 6) is often times not as compelling as that of S1. Season 1\'s ending, one of the most powerful and melancholic endings in any artform--where Angelica slowly fades away listening to Marco retelling her favorite fairy tale, while other girls sang Ode to Joy under the meteor rain, is partially to blame here as well. As powerful as Madhouse\'s adaptation (bringing forward Angelica\'s death/reconciliation with Marco and make it concurrent with the Ode to Joy sequence) is, it makes telling more Angelica-centered story in later seasons redundant. Season 1 mastered the art of understatement and subtlety, turning the manga\'s brutal story (which is best served cold) into a calm humanizing story that powerfully protests against political-ideology-driven atrocities. That is a testament to Madhouse Studio\'s almost unmatched adaptation prowess. I further realized that after reading the original manga. In a way, S2 resembles the manga\'s style and pacing more than S1, but that exposed shortcomings of the manga rather than improving upon them. For example, S1\'s Henrietta is closer to a ""killer doll"" than her appearance in S2 (and that in the manga). I am arguing this is a deliberate artistic choice instead of ""poor animation/art"".  As the story progresses, the audience gradually figures out the meaning behind the song ""The Light Before We Land"" along with why the OP sequence heavily features Henrietta (including her doll-like cry/smile/leap). As one finishes S1, one would be inclined to reflect on their own limited time in this life, as well as how they treat their family/loved ones. Because if these hardened and stern handlers working for a most cruel bureaucracy can treasure and reconcile with their meteor-like cyborg girls, why cannot we do the same with people around us? These themes might not be so fleshed out in the manga or S2, especially since S2 downplayed the inevitable and ever-heavier final fate of the girls. After finishing S2 and 2 OVAs, I did not feel like I have gained new insights into the characters. The final scene (Jose and Jean went to swim with bikini-wearing Henrietta and Rico) just feels weird.Despite all that, S2, for the most part, solidly and faithfully delivered the manga\'s story.']"
Heat Guy J,https://myanimelist.net/anime/958/Heat_Guy_J,"[""If you ever gain the slightest bit of interest to watch this show, WATCH IT.  I was skeptical at first, due to the subpar-looking character designs, wonky name, and typical sounding synopsis.  However, it only took about 10 minutes of the first episode to completely hook me on the series.  The show completely blew all my expectations out of the water.The art is great.  You might be skeptical at first, but the style flows very nicely in the show.  The character designs are from the same person behind Escaflowne.  There are some very well-animated scenes throughout the show, and...never do you see signs of lazy animation throughout.  There is also some well integrated CG, that remains exclusive to more complex buildings and vehicles.The sound was good.  Nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad.  Some of the songs may seem tacky at first, but the show reuses them in all of the right situations, to tie feelings into newer scenes, and you'll like the soundtrack more by the end of the show than you did in the beginning.The story is fantastic.  It starts out relatively small, as explained in the synopsis, but continually grows to be greater than you'd expect.The characters are what make this series shine, however.  Daisuke Aurora has easily weaseled his way into my top 5 protagonists.  He creates fantastic relationships with many unlikely characters throughout the show.  Deep themes of friendship and seeing the good in people are present throughout the entire series, right down to the epic conclusion, and those themes are what will leave a lasting impact on you after completing this series.I highly recommend this to anyone with a slight interest.  The show reminds me a bit of Gungrave and Cowboy Bebop, as it involves a large, rather corrupt city, with some amazing protagonists.  Give the show a chance, and I guarantee you'll be hooked with the first episode.  If not, well, this probably wasn't your cup of tea to begin with. never do you see signs of lazy animation throughout.

It's basically in the detective/action genre that's set in the future, in a unique environment where cities are divided and dependent on a race of people that provide the technology for air and water, and there are also people living outside of this city in the underground and in the forests avoiding the people in the main city. The main character is a detective of sorts who's partner is a robot &quot;J&quot; that assists him in his quests....The episodes are rarely repetitive and we watch as the main character collects friends throughout the series that offer him assistance in his many endeavors. There is also some nice plot twisting and well integrated CGI that didn't become bothersome. All this is highly impressive, especially for an anime you can find in the bargain bin at your local con.

Highly recommended."", ""Heat Guy J is an anime created by director Akane Kazuki. It was one of Satelight Studio's early productions. This will be their second anime I look at. The first being Sousei no Aquarion, an entirely bland offering. Will this one be any better? Let's take a look and find out.Story:In the future, mankind is living largely confined to large cities not because of man eating giants but because their electric and water purification grids only function in certain areas and there's only a small group that still understands how the technology works. In the city of Judoh, Daisuke Aurora works for the city's special...services division to prevent crimes along with his android partner, J. Most episodes deal with Daisuke and J solving cases. There is an underlying story arc about Daisuke looking for his father's murderer, but I can't go into too much detail about that without spoiling part of the series. Especially since most of the stuff that actually comes from that happens near the end.Let's start by looking at what the story does badly. The first thing is the pacing. They keep going back to the underlying plot but they don't really go anywhere with it besides reminding you it exists until the last three episodes. At which point everything just gets thrown at you and there's a rushed, hastily resolved climax. The episodes and cases also vary in quality quite a bit, some are pretty good but on the opposite end you have the stuff with the Siberbians, a group of people who are painfully stupid to watch. They don't believe in technology, except for the stuff they actually use because going without entirely would just be so darn inconvenient. They also believe strongly in the ideal that every adult should be fully independent, except that they have a society with laws, enforcement of said laws by members of the village who work together and a leader. They also subscribe to other ill-conceived, irrational and inane religious/philosophical ideas. There are only two episodes with these clods and they are terrible. You also get some clunky exposition dialogue and forced events that happen solely because the plot needed them to.So, what does the series do well? Quit a bit, actually. A lot of the concepts at play are kind of interesting and fairly unique. Most of the cases are decent enough with some good moments and tension. There's a lot of potential in the world itself and it is somewhat well taken advantage of. The series also does a good job of introducing most of the important plot elements that are going to eventually come into play for the climax well in advance and in a subtle way. You never know what previous events that seemed like just parts of a single case are going to come back as an important point until right near the end and when they do get brought up it makes sense given the context.Characters:The best way to describe the characters in this series is that they're close to kind of standard archetypes with maybe one or two things to differentiate them from the usual character types they're playing off of. There are exceptions, a lot of the one shot and side characters just are their tropes, and there are a few characters like Boma or Daisuke himself who are more interesting, but in general that's what you can expect. A certain character type with a few additions. They aren't badly done, mostly, just don't expect anything too good from them. This isn't at Stand Alone Complex's level.Art:The art style is pretty unique but it doesn't look bad by any means. The characters look pretty good and the action sequences are nicely done, mostly and the futuristic tech you see is visually interesting. If there's any problem with the art it's that the backgrounds tend to be pretty basic. They don't look bad, but they do look like not a lot of effort went into them.Sound:The performances are decent enough, although most of them aren't anything great. The actors do their jobs competently although you do get some exaggerated lines and some that are a little wooden. However, those lines that are a bit wooden come from Sugou Takayuki who's voicing J and they give the character an inhuman quality that works given that he is an android. There is one really strong performance and it comes from Sakurai Takahiro, the same actor who voiced Cloud Strife and Megaman X. The music is pretty standard. It's simple and functional.Ho-yay:This series has a little bit. The dynamic between Vampire and Daisuke comes across as fueled by sexual tension at a few points. Kyoko also takes another girl home with her at one point although that one is less homo-erotic and more that the plot needed it to happen. So, the ho-yay factor is a 2.5/10. There's a little, but it goes nowhere.Final Thoughts:Heat Guy J is a sci-fi series with some interesting elements, nicely done action and good episodes. It also has some really bad episodes and a lot of general story issues. If you're a fan of sci-fi police stories you'll probably enjoy it. For myself, it's a 6/10.

Until then, have a happy new year everybody."", ""It is always satisfying to see a show with a lackluster start end on a strong note. Such is the case with Heat Guy J, a show that at first wallows in tired buddy cop hijinks, but ultimately proves to be a worthy watch in the long run.The story follows Daisuke, a young smart-mouth cop and member of Judoh City's Special Services Bureau, and his android partner, J. Together they work to prevent crimes from happening in Judoh, under the supervision of Daisuke's older brother Shun. Daisuke and J have their hands full as the streets of Judoh are crawling with crime, from terrorists to...organized crime syndicates. On top of that they have to deal with a rising, ambitious, and disturbed crime lord, Clair Leonelli. Much of the first half of the show is mostly standalone episodes of Daisuke and J busting down on baddies. These episodes range from being very good to very mediocre, with the cases involving Clair Leonelli being the best; and ones not involving him leaning more on the sour side. This is the big problem with the first half of the show, for every good episode there is an extremely underwhelming one; with a cliche, old, tired plot. Even some of the better episodes are just 'okay'. Honestly, watching through much of the first half feels like a bit of a chore. Luckily, there is some world building and character development in these episodes which really does payoff later in the long run; it is just that the episodic scenarios surrounding said development are washed up and stale.The show picks up in episodes 11 and 12, which reveal more of the workings of the world of Heat Guy J. The existence of the Celestials and the way they keep order in the world is thought provoking in on its own, and easily one of the more fascinating aspects of the show. It was also fun to watch Clair wreck havoc and almost destroy the entire city of Judoh, and solidify his rivalry with Daisuke. The quality of the episodes after 11 and 12 was a big improvement over the first half. From an assassination attempt on Daisuke's brother Shun, to Clair's attempt of revenge on Daisuke in the fallout of events of episode 12, the scenarios of each episode where more engaging and exciting that those of the first half. Characters that saw minimal development before, got their fair share in these episodes; most notably the Special Services Bureau's secretary, Kyoko, and the wolf-headed hybrid Boma.All the while, even deeper darker secrets of Judoh are slowly unraveled, leading to a twist late in the show (which you may or may not see coming) that makes the show's final arc its most gripping and touching; ending on a strong note. Even still, the cliches of the first half are still very much present, and bog down the shows quality at times because of how conventional it feels.As far as the characters go, Heat Guy J has a pretty decent cast. The titular character J is a pretty cool android. It is a feat to make a character who is inhuman yet has personality, but J pulls it off quite well. To be fair, J does display human-like attributes, but that largely feels due to his programming, which it is. There are times, however, J does come across as a bit too human; enough so that some viewers will have to take this with a grain of salt, especially since themes of what make up a sentient being are not present at all in the show. Where J is stern and (obviously) kind of robotic, Daisuke is laid-back and likes to take things in stride. This makes his chemistry with J pretty fun to watch, albeit also pretty conventional. At times it feels like the writers were trying too hard in making him cool and carefree, but the character does have enough personality to prevent him from being just another 'cool guy' type character. Clair is by far one of the most fun characters in the show despite being cartoonishly despicable much of the time, kind of like Joker from the 90's Batman animated series, but with daddy issues. The rest of the cast all have their time in the light and are all likeable, but very much part of an ensemble; which ultimately caps their development.Heat Guy J is pretty solid on the technical side of things. Character designs are diverse, with Daisuke, Kyoko and Clair being more slender than the gruffer guys in the cast like J and Giovanni. Characters are colorful but thankfully not outlandish. The city of Judoh is quite a site; beautiful metropolitan streets juxtaposition with broken down slums and dangerous alleys, the city feels like a character itself at times. The look of the show is not particularly innovative, in fact it looks like many sci-fi thrillers, but overall it still nice. The music is also good, particularly during the action scenes, and a few other interesting music choices. However, it isn't fantastic, and at times it feels like certain themes are overused.Overall, Heat Guy J is a solid sci-fi police show. It has a rough start, and can often be bogged down by cliches. However, it picks up very nicely as it continues, and shines at the end.

Writing a review on this anime actually has me a bit puzzled in terms of how much I enjoyed it. Originally I became interested in the anime after seeing several advertisements online for the complete series on DVD. The fact that someone who worked on EscaFlowne was a part of it greatly influenced me in watching it as well.The plot is interesting. Its set in a somewhat futuristic city named, 'Judoh.' Judoh has a very strict law organization which the two main characters, Daisuke Aurora and the, 'Heat Guy' J, are a part of. It's more like a smaller version of Special...Ops, who specialize in doing a little under cover work in order to find the culprit and capture them. a lot of their missions usually involve illegal aliens.J is an android of unbeatable strength (in comparison to the other androids) and is Daisuke's partner of justice.So for the story, I would give it a 7/10, for the fact that the setting was likeable and certainly the last few episodes had me on the edge of my couch cushion! It would have gotten an 8, if not for the snail pace in which the storyline was shown in. It took around seventeen episodes for the main plot to flesh out, which, for me, made it hard to finish the series.The artwork was rather nice: a lot of it seemed almost like a tribute to the old EscaFlowne animation (character design-wise, and even personality-wise sometimes. Trust me, you'll spot an Allen Schezar and a Dilandau in here. xD) There was a bit of CG in this show at the points where they wanted to show an intense car chase scene, or when they wanted Daisuke to ride his blue motorcycle. The CG did not stand out too much, which I liked.The sound? (I'm assuming that means the music as well as the acting and all that.) I will say that the soundtrack is 100% unique. Who would've thought that android-battling and bagpipes would go together so well! The soundtrack was a very high point in this series, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting job in both Japanese and English was absolutely fantastic. This anime had one of the better English dubs I've heard in years.Character: Well, I can automatically say that J was a very cool character. Based on his programming, he would always spout these responsible lines about what a man should do in situations given to him. Particularly, his favorite line involved men never going back on their promises. If only every man was like J, jeez. XDDaisuke was a fairly interesting character. His calm, laid-back attitude grew to be rather loveable.Other characters in this series were definitely unique, and I will only say that the only person I did not like was Boma. Some may disagree with me, but his existence almost made it seem like he was just a quick little add-in. His backstory did not contribute to the major plot, and so I found myself annoyed whenever he came on screen.Overall, I would give this a 7/10. This is not an average anime, but nor is it a masterpiece. The slow plot pacing was what killed most of it for me, but that may be just because I wished for something to happen that would contribute to the main problem and solution in the end. Plus I had high expectations plot-wise because of the fact that someone from EscaFlowne was involved, and EscaFlowne had something contributing to the plot in practically each episode. If you have not seen EscaFlowne and you are planning on watching this, it may be better for you to watch this one without having something to compare to. ^^;; The things in this anime which made me enjoy it were J and his quoteable lines, the appearance of The Celestials (one episode for it? Come on now D:), the soundtrack, and most of all, the fact that romance was not a key factor between two particular characters by the end of it. You could sense something may happen, but for now, it did not. I usually love romantic endings, but only if the two characters are immediately meant to fall in love from the get-go (or if they make continuous hints of romance throughout the series.) HeatGuy J had a few hints of romance, but not many. So the ending decision was a good one.So in conclusion, the story could have moved a little faster, the final three episodes were basically amazing, J's image of a man is the most ideal man out there, and people who have seen The Vision of EscaFlowne may like the reminiscent character designs.A fine job, but it could have been just a little bit better.Thanks for reading!

Particularly, his favorite line involved men never going back on their promises. If only every man was like J, jeez. XDDaisuke was a fairly interesting character. His calm, laid-back attitude grew to be rather loveable.Other characters in this series were definitely unique, and I will only say that the only person I did not like was Boma. Some may disagree with me, but his existence almost made it seem like he was just a quick little add-in. His backstory did not contribute to the major plot, and so I found myself annoyed whenever he came on screen.Overall, I would give this a 7/10. This is not an average anime, but nor is it a masterpiece. The slow plot pacing was what killed most of it for me, but that may be just because I wished for something to happen that would contribute to the main problem and solution in the end. Plus I had high expectations plot-wise because of the fact that someone from EscaFlowne was involved, and EscaFlowne had something contributing to the plot in practically each episode. If you have not seen EscaFlowne and you are planning on watching this, it may be better for you to watch this one without having something to compare to. ^^;; The things in this anime which made me enjoy it were J and his quoteable lines, the appearance of The Celestials (one episode for it? Come on now D:), the soundtrack, and most of all, the fact that romance was not a key factor between two particular characters by the end of it. You could sense something may happen, but for now, it did not. I usually love romantic endings, but only if the two characters are immediately meant to fall in love from the get-go (or if they make continuous hints of romance throughout the series.) HeatGuy J had a few hints of romance, but not many. So the ending decision was a good one.So in conclusion, the story could have moved a little faster, the final three episodes were basically amazing, J's image of a man is the most ideal man out there, and people who have seen The Vision of EscaFlowne may like the reminiscent character designs.A fine job, but it could have been just a little bit better.Thanks for reading!"", 'Heat Guy JStory: 7/10Heat guy j is an action packed story following two members of The Department of Security, Daisuke Aurora and his android partner J, as they protect the city of Judoh\' citizens from the criminal underground. Meanwhile things heat up as the most prominent mafia Don is succeeded by his young, and mentally unstable son, Clair Leonelli. Clair is a cruel, and calculating young man out to prove that inexperienced or not, He can carry his father\'s title of ""Vampire"". Now our heroic duo must not only foil every petty criminal in town, but also take on the entire Leonelli ""family"".Hitman Reborn this...is not. The mafia is portrayed in a far more traditional way, far out doing the aforementioned Reborn. If you want a hard boiled mafia Heat Guy is the way to go. Ties run deep, and betrayal will find no forgiveness. The only thing stopping me from raising this title\'s score is the episodic formula. It\'s pretty easy to follow with it\'s episodic stories, and underlying plot. Many of the mini arcs are interesting, unpredictable, and quite memorable.Art: 8/10At first I was offput by the character designs. I found them fairly unappealing. The artist behind them is none other than Escaflowne\'s own Nobuteru Yuki. I\'m personally not a big fan of his style, but the characters in this show come off very well....even if the do have strange, super pointy noses. They are all different in appearance, each having their own little quirks. Sexy Antonia, Smooth Daisuke, Insane Clair,and even Little Poor Girl Monica. Each design a perfect fit to the character in question. The animation is crisp, and doesn\'t get chunky during the fight scenes. It is sometimes hard to believe this show is getting close to ten years old. The world in which Heat Guy J is set is also expansive, even though most of it takes place in the city of Judoh. The backgrounds created for this series are well detailed, and lively. In populated areas, there are bystanders, instead of empty streets. The creative team obviously put some effort into making us believe in this city. From expansion bridges to underground cities, the backdrops all pull in to the city of Judoh.Sound: 8/10The opening song ""FACE"" by Tryforce sets the mood for the show. It\'s a catchy song that fits the overall mood of the series. The only problem is that it isn\'t to memorable. The first ending song, ""Gap In The Heart"" by WYSE is a little bit faster, and has a pretty amazing set of lyrics. The second ending song ""Hikari"" by Saeko Chiba is slow, and beautiful. I would be hard pressed to call it a good match for Heat Guy J though. The background music for the show fits really well. I find that if background music flows so smoothly with the scene that it doesn\'t distract you, then it is just right. The soundtrack just adds to the overall ambiance of the world of Heat Guy J.Characters: 9/10Heat Guy J has a fairly diverse cast of enjoyable characters.The sexy doctor Antonia, who treats J like a member of her own family.The poor girl Monica who sells photos to take care of her mother.The insane mafia Don, Clair.The smooth talking crime fighter, Daisuke.The waaay to forgiving cop, Edmundo.Kyoko, the feisty coworker.Of course there is a lso J, the powerful android sidekick of daisuke.Every character serves a purpose. Right down to Daisuke\'s fangirls. Cynthia, Vivian, and Janis. Everyone has a reason to be there. The back stories are simple, and don\'t seem to leave the viewer bogged down with flashbacks. The characters relationships are believable, and don\'t seem forced. The heroes motives are clear, and the villains deserve what they get, even if "" That was a big loss"". Even as an android J learns little life lessons as he helps the Department of Security along the way.Enjoyment: 9/10Each story being different from the last, you never really know what to expect from this show.

I wasn\'t sure if this series was going to be predictable and boring.. however once into it, each episode was different and evolved nicely with great mixing of drawn and computer animation and stellar characters. It was a very pleasant surprise for me.Story 10/10: A suave ""detective"" like city worker with his machine partner fight crime in a corrupt city.. that\'s just the framework... the story delves into different types of people that are found in any given city and shows interactions and development of friendships, alliances & betrayals.Art 10/10: The art was fantastic. The characters were realistic and...they did a great job with minor & major details throughout. The CG was well mixed & impressive especially in regards to fight scenes and scenery.Sound 8/10: The sound involved was well placed, but not amazing.. the music grew on me- the opening was well planned for Dai & J relationship.Character 10/10: The characters were by far the best part of the series. Daisuke is probably one of the coolest characters I can think of in any series. His nonchalant yet caring attitude really shined. The sense of comradery in the series was great. There was a positive upbeat message of trusting and caring for others, even when it doesn\'t seem like its a good idea. J\'s character was great as well, Antonia created a great mix of serious but sincere personality traits in his hardware.Enjoyment 10/10: It was a wonderful series that made me feel a sense of pride for the town of Judoh.. even with all its faults...Overall 10/10: I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes action and a well developed story line. they did a great job with minor & major details throughout.

I grabbed the DVD box set from the bargain bin - vintage 2002, in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and with Japanese; English Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS soundtrack - can\'t resist a deal like this, right? In hindsight I have no clue how I managed to overlook this series for all these years.Storyline (might contain minor spoilers):----------------------------------------------The main character...Daisuke Aurora works with his android partner J for the City Safety Management Agency in the town of Judoh. The unit is supposed to investigate ""signs which indicate that future crimes may be committed"" - something like a preemptive task force it seems. The team is supplemented by Kyoko Milchan who is the office manager and has an eye on the budget. She also oversees the distribution of Daisukes weapon and ammunition which usually amounts to handing out a whopping three bullets (seems like they operate on a really strict budget, but on the other hand - who needs a lot of firepower with a guy like J around?).When Daisuke is not hanging around the office idling on the couch, evading requests for written reports and ignoring taciturn and motionless J standing on call, the episodes follow our heroes while doing their work, which consists mainly of information gathering from various sources in the town of Judoh. This way the main setting, which is the city of Judoh, slowly takes shape and the supporting characters are introduced. The early episodes concentrate on Clair ""Vampire"" Leonelli, the young and seemingly psychopathic newly established Don of the Company Vita Crime Syndicate, who is in the process of claiming leadership and taking over the operations after his father died. Organized crime is doing well in the city of Judoh and besides the Leonellis there are various other groups of mobsters watching over their turfs.General overview:---------------------What at first glance seems to be just a sequence of unrelated stand-alone episodes and disjointed cases slowly develops into a deeper and more complex plot while hints and bits and pieces of information begin to fall into place and allow glimpses into a rather intricately woven world. After episode four even the most casual watcher will suspect that a conspiracy is lurking somewhere ahead. The storytelling is excellent and never confuses its audience with nonessential information or the useless techno-babble that futuristic settings usually seem to spout . The plot unfolds in an unhurried way and then sucks the viewer in. The individual stories are interesting and well-structured with twists and turns and supported by memorable characters.The core of Heat Guy J is a classic detective story comprising (political) thriller elements and borrowings from the good fellas and buddy cop genres. The setting is vaguely futuristic, the cityscape and some scenes are so Blade Runnerish that calling them only ""inspired by"" is a rather friendly way to describe it. The creators designed a highly atmospheric and fascinating environment. The city of Judoh is done very convincingly, the streets are lively and busy with passers-by, bustling shops, traffic and a changing day and night scenery.The character cast is vast and all the recurring characters are well developed - many of them have an interesting background story, vices, quirks, problems and their own way of looking at life. The cast includes cynical cops, streetwise (small) girls, small-time crooks, gene-manipulated beings and corruptionists, to list just a few. All of them have a reason to be in the story and are not just padding or backdrop. The character interactions are convincing and entertaining. I found that only J himself of all things was lacking a bit in depth and personality, but oh well, he is a machine after all. He seems to gain a limited understanding of the world surrounding him in the course of the series though. Daisuke has this laid-back and politely observing way of doing things that makes him very endearing and as a bonus he is sharp as a tack. In the beginning it is hard to determine if he is simply phlegmatic or extremely broad-minded. Anyways, he is one cool guy.Although the scenery can be quite gritty and dark, there is not an overwhelming amount of violence or gore. Action scenes are not overly abundant and mostly short but they are nicely orchestrated when they occur. If you are looking for a shootout every two minutes or a non-stop action flick you better look somewhere else. You will get some impressive hand to hand combat, shiny sword action, gun fights - including even some tank fireworks - but only if the story really warrants such action. Also do not expect over the top comedy; the creator decided to incorporate some dry humor (in case of J a substantial amount of whacky one-liners...) and the dosage slightly increases in the later episodes but you will probably not suffer an uncontrollable laughing fit while watching.The underlying themes in the anime are about the importance and worth of friendship and loyalty, and the question if satisfying one\'s desire for revenge will make you a happier being or ruin you.Visuals:--------The artwork is stunning. Yes I said stunning. Although panels get reused and there are stills (with only camera pans and zooms used to liven them up some), the background artwork is gorgeous and atmospheric. Everything gives off the vibes the scene demands - be it dark, gritty and depressing or lively, refreshing and colorful. The setting is modern with a futuristic looking scenery as well as some retro elements. It is a weird mix of technologically highly advanced features and a lot of outdated machinery that looks like it was imported straight from the 50s.The character artwork is very unique with a slightly old-style feeling and might not be everyone\'s cup of tea. Heat Guy J was directed by Kazuki Akane with Nobuteru Yuki doing the character designs, both were also working on Escaflowne - so it is not a great surprise that the two shows share the look to some extent. If you have seen Escaflowne you will certainly recognize the noses. Woah, that nose! (ever read Asterix and Cleopatra btw? But I digress... sorry).The animation of the action scenes is nicely choreographed and really snappy-looking. Sadly I have to mention the 3D integration too I am afraid. It is not really good. Especially having to watch Daisuke ride his favorite vehicle (a kind of futuristically inspired motorbike with sidecar) on multiple occasions borders on irritating. But luckily the  3D CG parts are used sparingly overall - so it does not distract too much from the rest of the visuals and designs which are truly awesome.Sound:--------Holy cow! The score.I went searching for the OST directly after watching the first episode. This is one of the best anime scores I have ever heard. Electric guitars paired with folkloristic elements, choirs, piano, eery female vocals, tribal oriental-sounding tunes, acoustic guitar, percussion and techno beats, as well as a lot of other weird sounds. And best of all: bagpipes. Yes absolutely, I kid you not, they used bagpipes. All these ingredients produce one hell of a unique and adorable soundtrack. The music itself is used fittingly throughout the anime and adds the right mood, atmosphere and impact to the scenes. The OP ""Face"" by Try Force is a catchy rock song and fits the show well, the two EDs are nice but not very memorable.I cannot comment on the English dub, since I only watched the Japanese version. The 5.1 DTS track does not make much use of the back speakers, it is mainly center-oriented. Otherwise the sound mixing is fine. Music, speech and sound effects are clear and distinct. The Japanese voice cast is consistently excellent.Grumbling:------------Is Heat Guy J perfect? No. It falls slightly short of excellence. The end is rushed (maybe budgeting issues or just direction?). Although the finale has lots of oomph, the solution to the conflict for me was unconvincing and even kind of cheesy. There are also various plot holes and inconsistencies in the storyline. In the end  the imaginative world setting had not enough depth. I wish they had elaborated more on the directly antecedent history of the world and its power structures. Too much of the political, economical and social environment was left hazy and unclear. Another thing that bugged me was the lack of understanding and the insufficient interaction between Daisuke and J through great parts of the show.The Good:------------Bagpipes obviously. In addition Heat Guy J is stylish with a considerable cool-factor. It is good-looking, entertaining, has likable and unconventional characters, very well orchestrated action, an intelligent plot, and awesome music. Did I mention the bagpipes?Heat Guy J will probably appeal to people who like old-style adventure telling and detective/ thriller stories augmented with reasonably dosed action.

The series mixes around both ongoing plot and individual cases where Daisuke and his android partner J deal with the underworld of crime throughout the city of Judoh. One of the show's greatest strengths is the great deal of effort it lays out in laying out the world of the series and exploring its characters. Judoh is a city ridden with poverty, crime and corruption which the...series isn't afraid to tackle, even with Daisuke's character being as calm and easygoing as he is. People with positions of authority abuse their power. Those in the slums of Judoh struggle to get by and live on the streets. Crime syndicates have enough influence on city activity to evade arrest. The series also mixes in elements in or out of Judoh that effect the city's activity and characters such as the Celestials, those living in the slum city in Judoh's sewers and a group of people who adapted to living without the conveniences of the city. While these elements seem irrelevant at first glance, they do hold a significance amount of influence on driving the show's plot and motivations of specific characters.Speaking of characters, Heat Guy J does enough at fleshing out many of its characters. The show explores the backgrounds, mentalities and personal beliefs of many of its prominent characters, including those among the crime syndicates of Judoh. Some characters even find their personal beliefs and mentalities challenged at points within the series when Heat Guy J chooses to address a major flaw or lingering story element that said character was dealing with throughout its run. From Boma's search for his lost sister to Claire handling the responsibilities of a mafia leader in his abusive father's footsteps, the series does enough to have you care for the challenges faced by many of its characters throughout the series.As I explained above, Heat Guy J's episodes are divided up into individual and ongoing plot focus. The individual episodes feature a self-contained case with many being used to explore and/ or develop its major and supporting cast. The 'ongoing plot' episodes slowly uncover a conspiracy concerning the city's power structure connected between crime syndicates and influential city leaders. These episodes take their time at slowly unveiling elements to the conspiracy and those responsible for it, as well as delivering some shocking plot twists that did enough to keep this reviewer interested. The only issue I have with the show is that the final episodes seemingly bring about the show's climax too quickly as the narrative wasn't as smoothly paced as much of the show had been running.In terms of presentation, Heat Guy J is visually impressive for a TV title featuring highly detailed and vast settings with vibrant color applied to them. This same detail and color also went into designing the characters, though their details do come across as a bit rough with a number of character designs. Animation in Heat Guy J is notable in that the show goes for a variety of different types of action sequences such as sword fights, hand to hand combat, fights between robots, gun action and even a land-to-sea battle involving a tank. Many of these scenes featured vehicles and characters moving about at a fluid pace and hardly any shortcuts were apparent with the animation. For music, the show's soundtrack consists of upbeat and haunting musical tracks featuring a variety of instruments such as electric guitars, woodwind and keyboard which blend together perfectly in the various scenes seen throughout Heat Guy J.Overall, Heat Guy J made for a surprisingly solid action anime with plenty of depth on its world and characters, as well as not being afraid to test out various types of action sequences with its animation and having a great soundtrack to listen to. This is a definite keeper if you are a fan of action anime and is one that needs more love from anime fans. series isn't afraid to tackle, even with Daisuke's character being as calm and easygoing as he is.

For music, the show's soundtrack consists of upbeat and haunting musical tracks featuring a variety of instruments such as electric guitars, woodwind and keyboard which blend together perfectly in the various scenes seen throughout Heat Guy J.Overall, Heat Guy J made for a surprisingly solid action anime with plenty of depth on its world and characters, as well as not being afraid to test out various types of action sequences with its animation and having a great soundtrack to listen to. This is a definite keeper if you are a fan of action anime and is one that needs more love from anime fans."", ""i always look for animes of a specific style, the same style of trigun and cowboy bebop. heat guy j has that style, and something the rest of them dont have.bagpipes, a whole lotta bagpipes.its structured in the same way as cowboy bebop, its mostly filler, a story episode in the middle and then it finishes with a bang in the end. most of the interesting stuff comes from seeing the characters and their backstory's, how they get along with the other characters.the art is good, nothing out standing, but it has its own unique style. all the backgrounds and vehicles are cgi and the...characters are animated in 2d at all times, even fight scenes. it doesnt stand out, the characters fit in with the 3D enviroment perfectly and allows for the camera to be played around with alot more.the music is great, everytime the android, heat guy 'J', gets into a fight bagpipes start playing. the opening and endings are great and i never felt like skipping them, the second ending i didnt like first but it grew on me. but the music has its own unique style to it.all the characters are bad ass, it doesn't always focus on the main characters, all the side characters have their own story and develop throughout the show and i grew to love them.when i watch an anime i either absolutely love it or i forget about it all together. a big factor is how re-watchable it is. something could be great like hellsing ultimate but after watching it i dont feel i need to see it again. an anime can be flawed like hellsing tv but much more memorable this is a flawed and very memorable anime that you will come back to every so often.one thing that i dont like is that each episode has a case to be solved, and there is a buildup to that case being resolved, the climax of each episode is very short, they find the bad guy fight him in a cool, but short scene and then case closed. they could have made these sequences longer.even though i said its flawed im giving it a 10 because i either absolutely love an anime or forget about it all together, and i absolutely loved Heat Guy J.Edit: forgot to mention that this has a great english dub. all the voice actors fit the characters perfectly. i watch the dub whenever possible(though i do check if its good first) and this is safe to watch in english. characters are animated in 2d at all times, even fight scenes. it doesnt stand out, the characters fit in with the 3D enviroment perfectly and allows for the camera to be played around with alot more.the music is great, everytime the android, heat guy 'J', gets into a fight bagpipes start playing. the opening and endings are great and i never felt like skipping them, the second ending i didnt like first but it grew on me. but the music has its own unique style to it.all the characters are bad ass, it doesn't always focus on the main characters, all the side characters have their own story and develop throughout the show and i grew to love them.when i watch an anime i either absolutely love it or i forget about it all together. a big factor is how re-watchable it is. something could be great like hellsing ultimate but after watching it i dont feel i need to see it again. an anime can be flawed like hellsing tv but much more memorable this is a flawed and very memorable anime that you will come back to every so often.one thing that i dont like is that each episode has a case to be solved, and there is a buildup to that case being resolved, the climax of each episode is very short, they find the bad guy fight him in a cool, but short scene and then case closed. they could have made these sequences longer.even though i said its flawed im giving it a 10 because i either absolutely love an anime or forget about it all together, and i absolutely loved Heat Guy J.Edit: forgot to mention that this has a great english dub. all the voice actors fit the characters perfectly. i watch the dub whenever possible(though i do check if its good first) and this is safe to watch in english."", 'First and foremost I want to say that due to there being only three types of reviews - 1. Recommended, 2. Mixed Feelings and 3. Not Recommended, I was forced to set my review as ""Recommended"", when in fact it\'s sitting between ""Recommended"" and ""Mixed Feelings"".I will get straight to the point, the characters are interesting and well developed, the story is also interesting, but the problem is the pacing and the cadence of events. What I\'ve noticed about more popular and mainstream animes is that they get you involved into it from the start, whereas, the exposé in Heat Guy J literally takes about...20 episodes before the plotlines start connecting and things begin to get interesting.The anime is by no means bad, but if you aren\'t very patient or don\'t have a lot of free time, like I am, you will feel bored and not getting that urge to keep playing the next episode. The story is good, the world it takes place is actually very interesting, I only wish they explored it more than they did, for example, what is outside the city of Judoh. If this series was 12 episodes instead of 26, it would have been even better. If it had a 2nd or 3rd season that addresses further events, it might have been even better.I guess the series didn\'t get enough traction so it never got the chance for further seasons.

The characters are pretty original so that's cool^_^Anyone should watch this anime I got the boxset it's wicked^_^ "", ""I'm not going to beat around the bush here, Heat Guy J is excellent. It is the kind of series you come across every once in a while where you know next to nothing about it and on paper it does not sound that great but once you watch the first few episodes it hooks you in and provides hours of solid entertainment. The reason i liked it so much is 2-fold. First,  it has got some great characters, and some really memorable characters: my personal favorites are clair leonelli, the head of the cities biggest crime family , and Buma, a sword-fighting werewolf...who not only looks cool but has one of the most entertaining sub-plots in the series:  and second, the story is extremely well told and is an interesting tale touching on many different themes and as a piece of mafia/crime fiction it could hold its own against many similar tales. The character designs are excellent across the board with one exception, Daisuke's brother Shun could easily pass for the twin brother of Integra from Hellsing, and the dub is extremely good here. a lot of dubs are poor but here it  is well casted and all the voice actors do a great job and fit their respective characters to a tee. The story really is the star of the series in my opinion . Once the main plot really starts to develop it moves at a great pace and there is not that many episodes i would consider filler. There are some great twists in the second half of the series and some of them really throw you off guard. The story deals a lot with the theme of revenge and to be specific the idea of taking revenge, versus letting go of your hate. Personally i find the mark of a good series is that when you are not watching it you are thinking about and trying to figure out whats going on, and Heat Guy made me do this a lot.The animation is also excellent and mixes in some CG/3D effects into some sequences and these sequences look good more than they don't. The action is fast paced and well animated.Overall this is an excellent series. The main characters Daisuke and J are fun to watch and have a great partnership and most of the support characters are equally if not more entertaining. It's got a great story and excellent animation and voice acting and i would reccomend it to any anime fan. who not only looks cool but has one of the most entertaining sub-plots in the series:  and second, the story is extremely well told and is an interesting tale touching on many different themes and as a piece of mafia/crime fiction it could hold its own against many similar tales.

He\'s partnered with an android called J who always has an anecdote advice for Daisuke in...each episode. Each episode has a bad guy and a case to solve, but it also seems to follow a hidden agenda.

The concept is great and extremely thought provoking, and it often makes allusions to other works and ideas which I loved. The world this movie is set in is very well built and established. The characters are often traveling and moving around and there are some complex political conflicts between...and within nations and groups, which is presented in a way that isn\'t so complicated that the viewer gets lost. Very well done in that aspect.We travel through the plot from the perspective of the main character and with him we come to understand human nature in the context of responsibility and freedom. The stance the movie takes on this subject doesn\'t interest me as much as how the movie simply brings this idea to the table for discussion. That was one of the aspects of the movie that bothered me, I just wish it went full out on the unfolding of the story and the conflict between the characters and the conflict within the characters instead of spending time making their personal commentary on the subjects. Another criticism I have is that there are some plot discontinuities and the actual concept of the ""genocidal organ"" seems pretty baseless and kinda boring, not that I\'m a psychologist or anything. But these criticisms aren\'t too significant in light of how happy I am with what this movie did right with the main theme of how freedom comes with responsibility that you have to be willing to bear.I highly enjoyed the characters from their designs to their personalities and struggles. They have flaws, make discoveries throughout the story, and have genuine thoughts and reactions. Their personalities are probably the weakest part because the story focuses on how the characters are relevant in the plot, although there are a few scenes that feature the characters in an everyday normal situation, and those scenes were great for their characterization, I just wish there was just a little bit more of that. All of the relevant characters are memorable, but there are some minor characters that serve as plot facilitators who are not expanded upon, and most of these characters work perfectly fine in the story, only one or two of them I wish were expanded upon a little bit more.As far as sound goes, they took a relatively minimalist approach to it, not having any outstanding standalone tracks, but simply having tracks that enhanced the scenes without making me wish for more. Overall I had no problem with the sound.The visuals were almost outstanding including composition, animation quality, color scheme, and design. The only issue I have is that there are a few short shots here and there where the animation isn\'t as good as the rest of the movie, and are pretty jarring relative to the rest of the visuals. But besides that, the quality is great, and the fight/action scenes are composed and executed extremely well, making the action easy to follow and visually appealing, not to mention that these scenes have substance and meaning that relates to the story and themes, they are not just hollow and visually appealing for the sake of cool fight scenes.I think the themes of freedom and responsibility as well as the topic of terrorism are relevant in our current world, so I would personally give it an 8/10. It\'s a great movie that is entertaining and thought provoking, I definitely recommend it. and within nations and groups, which is presented in a way that isn\'t so complicated that the viewer gets lost.

Even Project Itoh's critically acclaimed novel wasn't perfect, but at least it delivered a semirealistic futuristic world with all its pros and cons of surveillance, nanomechanical warfare, etc. But this adaption is a failure in every aspect - whether or not you look at the trouble it went through during its production.Genocidal Organ fails to deliver a coherent storyline (and makes all the wrong choices through the way). It fails to replicate the detailed world building, Itoh is so well known for (compare with Harmony i.e.). It just scratches on the surface of the complex thoughts, this topic offers. The...animation is a pain in the ass (it doesn't matter if Manglobe went bankrupt during the process, you pretty much can see were they had their hands on - the quality differs from the bullshit of the so called 'animation' studio Geno made), as well as the character design. There are tons of cheaper shows, that look so much better than this useless piece of junk. And it is not just because of the american characters, it didn't look good at all. Thanks to the crappy animation and production. There were plenty of scenes looking clumsy and awkard, were you couldn't tell that this is a movie from 2017.Let alone the characters themselves without any personality... except for antagonist John Paul. Unfortunately, his shiny moments were too rare. Just like the nanomechanical warfare and surveillance systems, that helped build a world like only Itoh could have thought of. There were enough scenes showing how practical it can be, but little to less behind that facade. Which is a shame, especially regarding the way how it could have turned out, if the adaption followed its source material more truthfully AND considering the possibilities of anime.I don't want to compare with the original novel that much, but this adaption lacks of a fluent and reasonable story. Most of the plotpoints doesn't seem to be connected at all; they are more like various stations, which the story needed to pass for its clumsy conclusion.The only positive thing in here is the cruelty of war shown: childsoldiers vs modern warfare. In all its glory. There's no time to trivialize such things and that's the only strength, this movie shows. Unfortunately, these scenes are kept just like the whole essence behind the thematic: Shallow and irrelevant for the story or the plot, because Genocidal Organ doesn't give much about the complex nihilistic philosophy behind its pristine storytelling. What is freedom worth? Do you pay it from personal freedom or other countries, which can't keep up with the modern world of capitalism? animation is a pain in the ass (it doesn't matter if Manglobe went bankrupt during the process, you pretty much can see were they had their hands on - the quality differs from the bullshit of the so called 'animation' studio Geno made), as well as the character design.

As Kravitz digs further into the mysteries surrounding John, he finds that the world he assumed to be one where American actions seem just are in reality a fabrication due to mass psychological manipulation from the various world governments to have the populace conform to accepting a new world order where their thoughts and actions are monitored and manipulated.Genocidal Organ serves...as a criticism of post-9/11 times with a number of first world countries turning into surveillance states where citizen freedoms are no longer guaranteed as they are continually monitored, have their privacy compromised, and are continually manipulated by their government and corporate entities, America being quite the offender in this regard with their actions against foreign nations that are a threat to its global influence and passing laws like the Patriot Act that sacrifice citizen freedoms for the so-called War on Terrorism. This is explored through Kravitz's investigation into John Paul's activity as his search for John leads him into Bosnia, a third-world country effected by the recent string of terrorist attacks supposedly influenced by John. Within the world of Genocidal Organ, military soldiers are artificially enhanced into becoming super-soldiers to become more efficient at completing their missions yet at the expense of their humanity. This offers an interesting parallel to real-world events like the 2003 American invasion of Iraq where the American government manipulated its populace and military into believing military invasion of the country was justified due to the threat of nuclear weapons from the country, that were later discovered to have never existed.The film offers a believable look at how the actions of a first world nation like America could negatively impact life for the citizens of a third world country like Bosnia. John comes to learn of terrorist cells forming in the country that are opposed to the presence and influence of foreign nations on their country's affairs, as well as being considered an unwelcome presence within the country. Again, this creates parallels to real-life events as Iraqi reception of American military presence in their country was largely opposed, a shocking reality for American soldiers who assumed that they would be welcomed in the country as heroes for their actions in overthrowing dictator Saddam Hussein.Besides the global effect that surveillance states have on other countries, Genocidal Organ also offers a solid exploration of the psychological effects that they would have on its citizens. This can be explored in some of the movie's more casual scenes as Kravitz casually interacts with his fellow soldiers during downtime at places like a tavern that show how desensitized they have become to the violent acts committed in various countries throughout the world. The issue is also addressed during military missions when Kravitz and his comrades casually banter on how drugged child soldiers they gun down are no different from them in how they are mentally conditioned in their actions, showing the detachment they have toward the horrific acts that these children have experienced. Again, this runs parallel to real world circumstances with manipulative tactics like materialistic excesses, information manipulation, and media sensationalism used by corporate entities and government officials to distract American citizens from the reality of their actions effecting foreign nations and having the citizens become desensitized or developing indifference toward the suffering of others due to being more concerned about the needs of themselves or others around them.While the film offers a solid exploration of its plot and themes, one major thing it struggles with is creating solid and relatable characterization. Characters come off not feeling like real people at many points and instead feel more like shells used by the developers of the film to reflect on its themes through long dialogues. The film appeared to attempt creating some sort of relationship between Kravitz and a Slav tutor named Lucia, though this came off as feeling unconvincing and feeling like a forced attempt at exploring the film's themes. Also, the motives that John Paul had for driving his terrorist acts came off feeling a bit absurd in their implementation and the film ends in a rather anti-climactic matter in resolving how things end up with both John and Kravitz.In terms of presentation, Genocidal Organ is easily among the best animated of the three Project Itoh films thanks to its use of more lifelike and realistic settings and character designs. With the more realistic setting, scenery designs are believably depicted and characters are drawn with more realistic bodily details and proportions compared to many modern anime titles. There is a great deal of fluid movement depicted throughout the film, especially during action sequences when Kravitz and American soldiers are engaging terrorist hideouts during their missions. The soundtrack consists of typical orchestral scores that don't particularly stick out, but are effective at conveying the right mood during Genocidal Organ's more dramatic and poignant scenes.In spite of its issues with characters and its ending, Genocidal Organ is still a mostly solid political thriller that strikes parallels to real world events in exploring the effects that surveillance states like America have on other countries in a post-9/11 world through Kravitz's mission to apprehend John Paul. In spite of its flaws, I would still recommend older audiences to at least check out the film once. as a criticism of post-9/11 times with a number of first world countries turning into surveillance states where citizen freedoms are no longer guaranteed as they are continually monitored, have their privacy compromised, and are continually manipulated by their government and corporate entities, America being quite the offender in this regard with their actions against foreign nations that are a threat to its global influence and passing laws like the Patriot Act that sacrifice citizen freedoms for the so-called War on Terrorism.

Someone less easily swayed will almost certainly view this in a worse light.Everything besides the premise is a train wreck. The animation bounces between being generic and looking like some of the more clumsy CGI that I have seen outside of a Syfy original. The actual storyline itself is clearly adapted from something that had more time to flesh out motives...and a world. If it weren\'t for the macguffin that was ""language of genocide"" then you would at least be left with a passable near future science fiction story about the dangers of complacency and trading freedoms for security, both themes that were hinted at throughout the movie.Instead, you have a story that hops between destinations, has seemingly random time jumps, dry characters with nonexistent or nonsensical motives, and a plot that just kind of leaves you scratching your head at the end. It\'s clear that someone cared about these issues that do have real world consequences, but this wasn\'t the team to communicate them to the rest of the world. and a world.

It\'s all propaganda. The protagonist is spewing propaganda. The antagonist is spewing propaganda. The government is spewing propaganda.A: Oh no, these bad third worlders just hate the West for an unexplained reason, therefore I\'m going to stimulate genocides to have them kill each other. Meanwhile completely avoiding the fact that the only reason why these third worlders became involved with the West is because of the Imperialist streaks of Nations like the United States and Russia waging proxy wars in the Middle East. Killing countless civilians and militants. This shit film completely...foregoes this root cause and just jumps to, “muh 9/11”.  Garbage.B: The government is not in the business of preventing genocides. LOOOOOL! Suggesting that they’re invading these countries in order to prevent them is fucking laughable. They\'re in the business of war profiteering but this garbage film presents it as, ""we\'re just trying to protect the people from the bad dictators, hurr durr"". Meanwhile, ""Operation Northwoods"", is the norm. Garbage.C: The protagonists “falls madly in love”, with some broad he knew for like 3 days. This shit makes no sense at all. Why does he care to the degree that he does for a virtual stranger? Garbage.D: The protagonists actually somehow has a senate hearing. Freaking ridiculous! It would have been accurate if he had been gunned down by the state. And you see a Military General just face palming in an absurd fashion when in reality this trial would never happen and he\'d be giving the order to end this whistleblower. God only knows how many soldiers with an intent to blow a whistle have been mysteriously “KIA”.E: Bosnia has a homicide rate of 1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants. In other words; small, tiny, infinitesimal relative to where the antagonist is from, the United States. Therefore, if his genocidal logic is to be followed, his very first target should be his home country. Not places like Bosnia.On the plus side, great art. Cool explosions.

Williams was funny.', ""Finally, I watched the only Project Itoh movie I have never seen and that was Genocidal Organ. With watching this movie, I finally could summarize some things about Project Itoh movies in general. And the truth is I am a little bit disappointed with how all of the movies turn out. Before that... Let's talk about Genocidal Organ.The story baseline itself, in my opinion, is already interesting but from how it is executed, the interesting potential fell into boredom. In the beginning, the idea of word structures that could trigger someone to do a genocide piqued my interest as it kinda reminded me of Captain...America's best friend who were brainwashed with train of different words in Russian. I always knew that human's basic instinct is to survive and to survive, human could do many things from farming, hunting, working, to even do criminal things. Triggering that basic instincts could lead into many things just to ensure human's own survival. Anyway, I felt sad and disappointed by this movie as they presented the idea with pouring so much expositions and dialogues (even monologues) that left me bored halfway and really wanted to skip the talking. The theme of war is already a good set to explain everything in action not in exposition and that's another good potential being wasted just like that.After the story, there's the character. While I know that they were trying to make us sympathize with the two soldiers bud, I can't help but not feeling any connection to both of them as they were too focused on pouring expositions than working on something else. There's the main villain, John Paul, being tainted by too many expositions and talking. It made me unfocused and bored.So, after watching all of the Project Itoh movies, I finally know what is the main problem of these movies and that is too many exposition that is explained by long dialogues and monologues. I knew that these movies are adaptations of novels and I think this is why not all novel (or manga) could be adapted into other media and better stay in the media where it is from. And that is why too, the screenwriter should be braver to defy the original material just to deliver a more suited story for a media (just like the case with recent adaptation of Hanebado!). Not all changes are bad yet not all unchanged things are good. A good screenwriter is someone who make a balance between that and make an already present story suited for an adaptation or even make it better.Back to Genocidal Organ, I conclude that this movie has a very great potential but wasted with clouding that potential with expositions that made me bored halfway. Should have this anime more actions, I might appreciate this anime. America's best friend who were brainwashed with train of different words in Russian.

And as such, the main characterand others in US special forces as well as society are oblivious to thevictims of these wars that manipulate children of third world countries, huntspecies destructively for their important biological components etc.Toward the end, it seems John Paul's motives inspired one of Clavis' bestmate to suppress John Paul and Lucie Paul in order to prevent it from reachingthe media. This is a surprising turn of events that shows where the trustreally should lie - Both characters within this scenario are fighting for aspecific motion, I feel the US government wants to cover this information upwhereas Clavis wants to release this to the world since it WAS his mainobjective (to investigate John Paul and his motives) since the beginning.Plot:The plot is very detailed but trails off as it focuses more on Clavis' love affair with Lucie. It begins very promising with a terror attack then eases within a military response which shows a lot of warfare that isn't as tightly connected with the overall premise but includes the possession of John Paul. I'd say in terms of plot, this movie is well deserving of a 6/10 it's either very deep and I'm not interpreting enough of the information it's provided or it's just very vague and abrupt.Art & Sound:The art style is seemingly reminiscent of Yuri on Ice (I haven't seen it it just feels like the US characters are similar to the characters of Yuri on Ice. That's not a bad thing, especially when it comes to the action scenes that end up being very detailed and logical. The VA could be improved, however I haven't read the source material so I'm not sure if it's an informed decision to have the characters not be as emotionally conflicted as other similar series. 8/10 seems sufficient for this film considering how much attention to detail was  placed in the animation.Character:Character development isn't what I really expected from this type of film but it did contain development within the main character Clavis' relationship with Lucie and John Paul. His understanding increased over the second half of the film but I wouldn't personally say it was a creative or intriguing way to develop the characters. 6/10 would seem fair to me since I didn't feel much character connection despite their development as a character.Enjoyment: Over the entire duration of the film, I feel I only enjoyed the action scenes which contained controversial content but it goes against the grain in terms of ethics. Genocide, advanced technological warfare, Child soldiers, mentioning of human behaviour etc. are what makes this film critical since there's little censorship in what's ethical in society. As such, it was interesting to see a change of pace compared to other films/series that tap into the military backgrounds. 8/10 in terms of personal enjoyment. have been the grammar of genocide.This dystopian society revolves around a period of nano-mechanicalwarfare and high technological military enhancements which,give or take can be reflected within the ideals of our current day society.This also raises questions of whether this is excessive usage of influence.I personally feel this film offers a lot on the surface level which istextbook for a film that is 2 hours comparitive to a full blown series.And as such, it gets a lot of flack for its shortcomings based other intenseworks by the author.In this universe government coverups are frequently performed to protect theunethical motives from leaking to the public.

It\'s the future, the world is sh!t, and apparently some guy named Jake-oops i mean- John Paul is behind it. The main character,Clavis Shepard then goes undercover as a foreign language student to get closer.It sounds exciting right.To be honest multiply that potential by 0.4 and you got the outcome. The movie has a nice concept of people not having a certain amount of emotion,but about half way through, it turns on the politics and becomes way too smart for it\'s own good.So much comes from the mouths of characters yet it doesn\'t correlate with...the settings. If this is plus, it\'s kinda similar to reality where people say don\'t trust the government cuz it\'ll control your mind,but that won\'t stop you from eating a cheeseburger. But when I sat down to watch this, I expected a Military,Scifi, not a documentary.I wouldn\'t even mind if the movie didn\'t  feel so damn long. I wanna say I have bad taste, but I saw GITS and Eden of the East and love the crap out of those two shows. It\'s because there was a more distinguishable tone with very intense moments and characters full of EMOTION.This show, which isn\'t even a show but a movie, is full of talking heads and there are some action scenes. but it doesn\'t help the rest of the movie.I honestly felt like falling asleep at the climax of the movie because I was so uninterested, it may have been my tastes. but I just couldn\'t force myself to be interested.This movie has a very interesting story when it comes to production. It was announced to be released by Manglobe, but the studio bit the dust after bankruptcy in 2015. But, in 2016, Manglobe rose from the dead to complete the movie with the help of Geno Studio, the same studio who made Kokkokou and Golden Kamuy. After watching both shows, and this movie, I can easily tell the new studio\'s strengths and weaknesses,Their strength is have very nice art style and animation. The actual art style of the movie feels more like a comic book than an anime which is very refreshing. Also,the animation is nice and fluid(if there was anything happening)here is so much product placement. It\'s insane. Their weakness however is working with 3D. In this movie, the 3D is not as bad in the movie as it is the shows, but it makes it look like a gameplay video of COD.Out of the three Project Itoh films, this is above Harmony but it\'s not as good as Empire of corpses.The soundtrack of the movie is full of classical tracks that don\'t stand out.Probably because the sound of everything else is so loud.If there was one song that was definitely a standout was the ending song by Egoist.It\'s frickin brilliant and offers the amount of thrills that the movie never could.As a fan of funimation, the dub was actual pretty good, maybe since this movie is filled with Americans and Europeans.Oh yeah, the characters. There is a process in the movie where soldiers cannot have a certain amount of emotion because they will interfere with their duties. The thing with emotionaless characters is without any charm to them, they have to have some depth that puts them over the line.It happens with the Main character, but it\'s too little too late. Everyone else is either boring or stereotypical. My favorite character has to be one of the supporting soldiers. I don\'t remember his name, but he\'s the one who hangs out with the MC the most.He was emotionless but it was in a carefree way. He was super chill and didn\'t care about anything.Most of the humor came from him(which isn\'t an understatement since this movie takes itself more seriously than ""Rainbow"").Now, if you are reading this after watching the movie, and you enjoy it. Good for you. There may be things that I get wrong, but the point is I do not have the interest to watch the movie again.It\'s so philosophical, but nothing and I mean nothing pays off or gets my attention. I feel robbed of my time. I can\'t stand when a Sci-fi movie thinks talking heads is enough.Sure that works in movies like ""Spotlight"". But that movie is based on true events. This movie takes place in a futuristic society with so much product placement.Out of the three Itoh movies, this has to be the one that I never want to watch again. Empire of Corpses was off the rails insane, Harmony was kinda boring but it had a nice element of surprise and tension. Genocidal Organ doesn\'t have neither, sure the animation is above average but it never reaches it\'s full potential. Technically, this movie is not the worst, but it is just so uninteresting ,with characters so intellectually,politically driven that it forgets to do anything else to be interesting and it makes me want to sleep. If you are a pseudo-intellectual, then this movie is for you, but i\'m just not a big fan of this.Overall-5Oh yeah, Manglobe died again after finishing the movie. the settings.

With its unique premise and fascinating setting Genocidal Organ could have become a great last performance for a studio that has produced a number of decent anime in the past.  Unfortunately Genocidal Organ is a disappointment as an anime film that fails to live up to its premise and throughout is a rollercoaster of highs and lows, mostly lows.Before I talk about the most egregious parts of the film, the story and characters, I shall focus on the better aspects of the movie which made it watchable.Animation: Overall...the animation was decent throughout and enjoyable to look at. There is nothing too ground-breaking or revolutionary, but there is a consistent quality in every scene. The animation really shows its best with the battle scenes which are highly engaging and immerse the viewer into the film, also showing the most unique aspects of the near-future, specifically A.I and the use of super soldiers in warfare.Setting: The setting is a fascinating look into how our world could become in a couple of years with quicker development of current technology as well as heightened surveillance from a worse War on Terror. When the horrid plot isn\'t on focus, the key details in the background which shows how society in this semi-dystopia lives their daily lives, alongside the brutal battles in advanced warfare, captivate the viewer and leave them wanting for more. I must also give props to the writer for depicting American culture in a fairly accurate fashion rather than some of the more infamous stereotypes presented in past anime.Sound: The OST is pretty lackluster with absolutely no memorable original work from the movie. Most of the sound is kept grounded and focused on what is happening in the environment rather than inserting a song. This both works and doesn\'t as it keeps scenes realistic yet it doesn\'t add further emotional weight. The only good instance of sound was an excellent insertion of Beethoven to add tension in the beginning scene.Characters: Now we get into the aspects of the story that really drag it down. Besides the four main characters of Clavis Shepherd, John Paul, Lucia, and Williams, the cast is completely forgettable with characters only existing to move the plot forward and not contribute anything of worthy enjoyment. Williams was the only likable character as he had a humorous personality and actually acted like a real human being instead of a robot that only contributed exposition and ranted about nonsense philosophy. The rest of the characters are abysmal.Lucia in her scenes range from passable and somewhat likable to a boring slate whose only purpose is to express to us Itoh\'s views on the world. Lucia has no purpose besides only acting as a token Bond girl and Shepherd\'s love interest, yet the romance fails completely when she and Shepherd have little chemistry and we aren\'t given enough scenes to show their relationship naturally improve.Shepherd is a badly written character because he is not a character in most senses. As our protagonist Shepherd is supposed to be the man we relate to and the person who acts as our guide to become immersed in our world. The problem with this is that we know nothing of Shepherd and he has no defining characteristics. Shepherd has no history, likes and dislikes, quirks, hobbies, dreams, wants or needs; absolutely nothing. I would say he\'s a robot but there have been multiple robotic characters in anime who are far more human than he is. The only moments he has any signs of character is when he rants about philosophy, a wannabe soldier scholar.  Even when he talks about philosophy and politics, there is no believing that these are Shepherd\'s POV and not Itoh\'s. His character arc is nonsensical and his decision in the end of the movie to enact a social revolution to end the state of surveillance comes out of nowhere. Shepherd is a blank slate that any other person could have filled and there wouldn\'t be a difference.And let\'s talk about John Paul, the villain of this film and ultimately its downfall. John Paul is a Mary Sue. Now this is a bold claim but it\'s one that any viewer can come to after watching the entirety of this film. John Paul somehow has this ludicrous method of making any person commit genocide simply because he speaks the grammar differently. This superpower is some nonsense science that has absolutely no basis in current linguistics and is just some macguffin that was created solely for the plot. John Paul can apparently make any country, no matter how stable, collapse in six months into total genocide. Somehow he can brainwash literally any person to do his deeds, he has loads of followers and an in-place support structure even though he is literally worse than Hitler. He has a hot girlfriend in Lucia. He gets Shepherd to agree with his viewpoints. He can escape any situation to avoid capture. John Paul manages all of this when he\'s a dropout from MIT. The character is a Mary Sue whose only purpose is to babble about psuedo-philosophy and psuedo-politics so that the message is hamfisted into the audience\'s mind.Story: The story is a trainwreck that focuses on four different and conflicting themes; genocide, government surveillance, loss of freedoms, and modernization. The writers want the audience to know that ""Big Brother is Bad, we must get our freedoms!"" but it\'s hard to focus on that when the antagonist who is advocating against the state, is literally committing multiple genocides just to get his point across. The involvement of genocide should have not been in the film at all as it makes what\'s supposed to be a grey conflict into one that\'s one hundred percent black and white, and completely against what the writers want us to believe. Multiple times in the film we are told that surveillance is bad, when through the dialogue and what we see in the background total surveillance actually works and has caused terrorist attacks to drop. The plot makes the U.S to be some sort of authoritarian police state that abuses its powers when we see no abuse of the system and it works just fine. The ending where Clavis starts his grand revolution makes no sense because the quality of life in America and Europe seems to be good, all thanks to new technologies and the police state. The story would have been far better if it was a series that slowly developed the world and actually showed us what\'s wrong with constant surveillance. With the inclusion of genocide there is no reason to actually think about the message as there\'s a straight forward right and wrong. However it is hard to actually focus on the message when every speech about society is based on the twisting of history, nonsense ranting about humanity\'s evils, and contradictory arguments that fall apart after a couple of minutes.The greatest issue with the story aside from its nonsensical message, is the Genocidal Organ. Obviously only the basic research on the actual history of genocide was performed due to the plot making it seem like genocide is one of humanity\'s darkest and most inane traits, when it\'s completely not. Until the Holocaust there was no word genocide as nothing on such a scale or intent had ever taken place before. Genocide while technically a definition for mass killing on a grand scale, always focuses on the mass murder of many individuals of a specific ethnic group. Genocide is horrible because it is irrational and is built on artificial hatred that dehumanizes one group into mass death. Genocide is NOT some survival instinct to purify the human population. There is no Genocidal Organ, therefore John Paul\'s plan is laughable and would never take place in the real world.In conclusion, Genocidal Organ is an average film with plenty of potential that was wasted in its production when Manglobe chose to focus on politics and philosophy instead of telling a good story. If Genocidal Organ was ever expanded upon and its world given greater focus with a well-written cast of characters and a story that is actually grounded and stays within reality, then it could be a great story to tell. Unfortunately with Manglobe going bankrupt it is likely that Genocidal Organ will simply fade away and be forgotten by all but a dedicated few. A tragic waste. the animation was decent throughout and enjoyable to look at. There is nothing too ground-breaking or revolutionary, but there is a consistent quality in every scene. The animation really shows its best with the battle scenes which are highly engaging and immerse the viewer into the film, also showing the most unique aspects of the near-future, specifically A.I and the use of super soldiers in warfare.Setting: The setting is a fascinating look into how our world could become in a couple of years with quicker development of current technology as well as heightened surveillance from a worse War on Terror.

The problem with this is that we know nothing of Shepherd and he has no defining characteristics. Shepherd has no history, likes and dislikes, quirks, hobbies, dreams, wants or needs; absolutely nothing. I would say he\'s a robot but there have been multiple robotic characters in anime who are far more human than he is. The only moments he has any signs of character is when he rants about philosophy, a wannabe soldier scholar.  Even when he talks about philosophy and politics, there is no believing that these are Shepherd\'s POV and not Itoh\'s. His character arc is nonsensical and his decision in the end of the movie to enact a social revolution to end the state of surveillance comes out of nowhere. Shepherd is a blank slate that any other person could have filled and there wouldn\'t be a difference.And let\'s talk about John Paul, the villain of this film and ultimately its downfall. John Paul is a Mary Sue. Now this is a bold claim but it\'s one that any viewer can come to after watching the entirety of this film. John Paul somehow has this ludicrous method of making any person commit genocide simply because he speaks the grammar differently. This superpower is some nonsense science that has absolutely no basis in current linguistics and is just some macguffin that was created solely for the plot. John Paul can apparently make any country, no matter how stable, collapse in six months into total genocide. Somehow he can brainwash literally any person to do his deeds, he has loads of followers and an in-place support structure even though he is literally worse than Hitler. He has a hot girlfriend in Lucia. He gets Shepherd to agree with his viewpoints. He can escape any situation to avoid capture. John Paul manages all of this when he\'s a dropout from MIT. The character is a Mary Sue whose only purpose is to babble about psuedo-philosophy and psuedo-politics so that the message is hamfisted into the audience\'s mind.Story: The story is a trainwreck that focuses on four different and conflicting themes; genocide, government surveillance, loss of freedoms, and modernization. The writers want the audience to know that ""Big Brother is Bad, we must get our freedoms!"" but it\'s hard to focus on that when the antagonist who is advocating against the state, is literally committing multiple genocides just to get his point across. The involvement of genocide should have not been in the film at all as it makes what\'s supposed to be a grey conflict into one that\'s one hundred percent black and white, and completely against what the writers want us to believe. Multiple times in the film we are told that surveillance is bad, when through the dialogue and what we see in the background total surveillance actually works and has caused terrorist attacks to drop. The plot makes the U.S to be some sort of authoritarian police state that abuses its powers when we see no abuse of the system and it works just fine. The ending where Clavis starts his grand revolution makes no sense because the quality of life in America and Europe seems to be good, all thanks to new technologies and the police state. The story would have been far better if it was a series that slowly developed the world and actually showed us what\'s wrong with constant surveillance. With the inclusion of genocide there is no reason to actually think about the message as there\'s a straight forward right and wrong. However it is hard to actually focus on the message when every speech about society is based on the twisting of history, nonsense ranting about humanity\'s evils, and contradictory arguments that fall apart after a couple of minutes.The greatest issue with the story aside from its nonsensical message, is the Genocidal Organ. Obviously only the basic research on the actual history of genocide was performed due to the plot making it seem like genocide is one of humanity\'s darkest and most inane traits, when it\'s completely not. Until the Holocaust there was no word genocide as nothing on such a scale or intent had ever taken place before. Genocide while technically a definition for mass killing on a grand scale, always focuses on the mass murder of many individuals of a specific ethnic group. Genocide is horrible because it is irrational and is built on artificial hatred that dehumanizes one group into mass death. Genocide is NOT some survival instinct to purify the human population. There is no Genocidal Organ, therefore John Paul\'s plan is laughable and would never take place in the real world.In conclusion, Genocidal Organ is an average film with plenty of potential that was wasted in its production when Manglobe chose to focus on politics and philosophy instead of telling a good story. If Genocidal Organ was ever expanded upon and its world given greater focus with a well-written cast of characters and a story that is actually grounded and stays within reality, then it could be a great story to tell. Unfortunately with Manglobe going bankrupt it is likely that Genocidal Organ will simply fade away and be forgotten by all but a dedicated few. A tragic waste.', 'Watching this movie will not be your typical experience. By the end, you will either love it or hate it.For some, this movie is a bootleg copy of ""Ghost in a Shell"" while for others the movie is far more than a ""deep anime"" trying to answer the existential problems of today\'s world, is a statement.Before starting the review I\'d like to say that I don\'t recommend this movie to casual watchers. Is a movie with a lot of philosophical, anthropological, and political themes.With all of that said here is the review:Part 1. ""The Absurdity of the World""When you watch Genocidal Organ, you will always...feel a little bit off about the movie and what it tries to convey exactly. Is it a movie about terrorism? Is it about patriotism? Is it about the meaning of life? Maybe it is about the horror of war?Well, in order to pinpoint exactly what the movie tries to convey, we have to understand a few key details about it first.You see, my dear reader, this is a movie that follows the philosophy of ""Existentialism"", and, in the manner of a ""Sartrian"" work, we can see a pattern of alienating the viewer from the action in the movie. This alienation is what we call ""the absurdity of the world"".  A strange feeling inside us that makes us confused or even angry or afraid due to the fact that we see familiar yet strange things, things that are normal and we take for granted... Yet at this very moment, all of these normal concepts become totally estranged from us. This is what the movie likes to call the ""Genocidal Organ"" or in popular terms ""The Absurdity of The World"".If you want to learn more about this philosophy, you should watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bQsZxDQgzUNow that we talked a bit about the movie we should talk a little about the author as well since his personal life had a major impact on the story.Part 2. Project ItohSo who is this person?Well, Itoh Satoshi was a web designer and novelist, but this is not the important part. You see, Satoshi befriended Hideo Kojima, actually, he was one of the ""few people"" to understand Kojima. This very friendship started Satoshi\'s passion for writing Metal Gear fan fiction and later on Genocidal Organ. In 2001 He was diagnosed with cancer. During his cancer treatments, he wrote Genocidal Organ and submitted it to the Komatsu Sakyō Award contest in 2006 (winning the contest). His Metal Gear fan fiction experience combined with his private life problems lead to the creation of a unique story known as Genocidal Organ, something that will kill its own ""self"", a metaphor for humans and humanity as a concept.So while you are watching the movie you might feel a lot of Metal Gear influences.Part 3. The MovieConsidering such an interesting author and source material, the movie doesn\'t fail to deliver an equally interesting story. With action pack sequences split by lengthy world and character-building segments. Even if the movie is only 114m long it will feel like 4 hours one, not wasting any second with meaningless scenes. The animationPart 4. The problems and final verdictThe Animation - While the scenes are cinematic and the color schemes are nice. The animation itself feels very ""low quality"" and outdated for a 2017 anime. Considering that the same studio made Samurai Champloo, Deadman Wonderland, and Ergo Proxy, it is odd that the final product feels so rough. But the problem isn\'t the rough animation, the real problem is the unnatural mix between 2d and 3d that just sticks out in your eyes.The Sound - Soundwise the movie is solid, it doesn\'t have any worth noting problem. With that said sounds and music aren\'t that memorable.The Characters - Saying that Genocidal Organ has memorable characters is a huge overstatement. By the end of the movie, I had already forgotten more than half of the names in it (including the main\'s character). You will not get attached that much if at all to the characters, but considering the theme of the movie, it is fitting, not the best idea but still, fitting enough to not care.The Story - The story is very similar to Tom Clancy\'s type of plot. There is not a lot to say about it. The story players out exactly as you\'d imagine.Overall the movie doesn\'t excel in anything. The art style is pretty common, similar to shows like Jormungand, Black Lagoon, or Ergo Proxy. The animation doesn\'t impress and the story is predictable offering little entertainment value. So if that\'s the case why did i rate it 7 instead of 4, 5 or 6. Well, that\'s the movie does put a lot of accent on details. From military procedures and banter between the soldiers to civilian life and the environment that builds the right atmosphere, in the dubbed version every character has, its own accent based on his native language adding to the flavor and immersion in the story. Oddly enough it manages to deliver the idea of Globalisation better than a lot of movies. In my book that\'s worth more than 5 or 6. Even if it is on my favorites list, I just can\'t rank it higher than 7. It is a mediocre movie at worse and a decent/good at best. You either love it or hate it. feel a little bit off about the movie and what it tries to convey exactly. Is it a movie about terrorism? Is it about patriotism? Is it about the meaning of life?

The movie suffers from an interesting premise burdened by generally flat characters and muddled storytelling that fails to fully develop any of its interesting themes. As an adaption of a nuanced and thematically dense sci-fi novel, the movie had a lot to condense into two hours, to the point of where it would be incredibly difficult to do so without diluting at least one of its themes. Instead, the movie opts to gloss over a...bunch of different themes. The phrase ""wide as an ocean, shallow as a pool"" comes to mind here, as each of its attempts to get the audience to think are fleeting and minimally effectual. The movie casts too wide a net and fails to catch anything of interest as a result. However, there are hints at a greater meaning at times, momentary glimpses at something profound. After watching the movie, I don\'t feel that my time was wasted; rather, I feel inspired to seek out the source material. For that, I commend the movie, for in its failures I feel compelled to improve my understanding of the story and its themes. bunch of different themes.

Almost boring in their cliché.My main problem : visuals are a matter of taste. I can however say I hated the way the characters look. The colors that were used also. It felt like some cheap rotoscopy (tracing over pictures) with some very poor colors pasted on them. To that, add some CGI which blended quite poorly and my eyes were screaming during the whole movie.(Possible spoiler here)...My second problem : though HINTED, we are never shown even the basics of how the villain actually created the conflicts. There is no resolution. Just very faint hints.(End of spoiler)I absolutely did not enjoy the experience.4/10, would not recommend.

The scenes just jump back and forth and some don't even make sense characters have dumb motives (main villain for example) and the whole story is crap. it does have some things well made. like what would happen if the world was or will be like viewers see in this movie. the show seems to have had a great idea but animators probably tried to cut the budget by not adding many scenes. I can tell that much.either way, its kinda lamely made but still enjoyable to watch. "", ""I watched Gyakusatsu Kikan, also known as Genocidal Organ. Here are my thoughts:I feel like military-themed sci-fi media such as this is one of the rare things that western entertainment does better than the Japanese (or at least used to).This movie does an okay job of creating suspense. The pacing is fine and it is competently directed.There were relatively few action scenes. I was expecting this to be a lowbrow sci-fi action movie, but it was slightly more complex than expected. However, you should be warned that there is a female love-interest character in this. Thankfully she does not suck up much screentime, although her...presence is influential.As far as the story goes, it was fairly generic near-future sci-fi. However, I will say that the involvement of linguistics was creative, or at least somewhat unique. Genocide is a significant theme in the story, as you might expect from the title. The movie is pretty morose, and you should expect people dying and a lot of bad things happening. When it does occur, the violence is pretty graphic.The characters as a whole are pretty generic, and not much character development takes place during the movie. I would have liked to have witnessed more interactions between the soldier characters. The focus on special forces soldiers did appeal to me, and I wish this aspect was examined even more in the movie. This is definitely a reflection of my own biases though (I have been interested in the psyche of SF soldiers for a very long time, and have listened to at least hundreds of their interviews over the years).In terms of sci-fi elements, there's some cool technology but nothing I hadn't seen before. Some of the futuristic combat technology was sorta neat I guess.Audiovisuals were adequate. The soundtrack was adequate but unremarkable. Voice acting was at best adequate, although there weren't many opportunities for a VA to showcase their talent anyway. Animation quality was fine, although hardly high-budget blockbuster anime material. Some of the European cities featured in the movie looked okay; otherwise, the visuals were fairly lackluster. Facial expressions were decently animated at least. Also, although infrequent, the action scenes did sound and look decent – not spectacular, but decent. I usually enjoyed them. They are shortlived though, so don't let that be your motivation to watch this.My overall rating: 5/10It was adequately entertaining and I never considered turning it off. However, there was nothing exceptional about this movie, aside from perhaps the use of linguistics in the story. There was some neat technology, but nothing much beyond your typical 'future soldier' stuff. As a whole, it felt like a pretty generic sci-fi military-themed movie.I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you are obsessed with sci-fi or have some strange fixation on genocide.

If you just feel like watching some futuristic combat, scan through the movie and watch the action scenes I guess."", ""This is the story that you can definitely watch while you're doing something else because it's quite hard for me to be engrossed in it due to how it only displays the top layer of the plot instead of diving deeper into the issue that it is planning to discuss on.Plot: Holds potential but merely scratching the surface layer. It lays out the idea of genocide via grammar but it does not go into how and why it is capable to do such things.

Whereas anime I feel confident have excellent conceptual ideas, I end up disappointed as they fall flat on their faces. Genocidal Organ is the latter.The first ten minutes are a solid hook. There’s fluid action, you’ve got an interesting modern setting, it boasts a slightly-altered timeline, presentation begins solidly, and the music is bangin’. The English dub is completely passable; would put in my personal top 3 dubs, easily. Rivals Jin-Roh’s vocal direction for maturity and realism.There’s only one hindrance to the opening scene, where the...protagonist and his victim wax philosophical for an entirely too-long period of time. I justified it as “Well he’s gotta cover a lot of ground in a short minute,” thinking it’d go away. Sadly, that’s your first warning of bad portends to come.The next forty minutes are molasses-slow exposition. Everyone explains everything to each other just for the sake of the audience. Instead of showing the plot, they tell it. This great, great idea, with its bevy of mature characters, its provocative setting, its unique combat pacing, its presentation through (for the most part) clean rotoscoping: telegraphed to the viewer at the speed of Morse code. The closest comparison I can make to this is American Sniper, where Bradley Cooper’s solemnly dedicated performance of Chris Kyle’s incredible life is hampered by amateurish regard for the film’s audience by SAYING what’s happening. That’s boring. That’s disengaging. That’s poor scripting.I’ll grant that the pacing is faster than something like Fate/Zero strictly due to the lack of anime grunts rightfully removed from the film. But the wordy, repetitious exposition is equally boring across both anime.The flow feels like a pulpy American action flick. Some aspects of Western pacing I really think are necessary and long overdue improvements for anime. But the way Genocidal Organ goes about presenting its story has me wondering when Bruce Willis is gonna show up as some hidden supervillain. It doesn’t really feel like “real anime,” if you know what I mean. I don’t see that as a flaw personally, but I think it’s important to mention if you, the reader, feel it’s relevant to whether you’re interested in this movie.It’s a shame. The gunplay and mature themes (such as child soldiers, heads up) reminded me of Jin-Roh. The socio-political setting felt VERY much like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex’s, and I believe that’s what the creators aimed for here: a world grappling with the trappings of budding technology, reigniting eternal arguments of liberty versus security. But on both counts, Genocidal Organ fails to hold my attention. The story is done better elsewhere, with a script not nearly this incompetent; and the combat and cool military hardware you can find in short compilations elsewhere.

In the end of the day it gets a 1 from me, I actually despise it, I actually dislike everything about it and about the ideas it tries to work with in a simplistic manner. I have no idea about the LN it's based on and therefor only measure this as it's own entity.Straight out of the bag - there are few dynamic, if you can call them that, scenes that...are far in-between, it had some cruel moments that follow usual conflicts.

Wait.. Was there animation?

Ai Yori Aoshi: Enishi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/394/Ai_Yori_Aoshi__Enishi,"[""Ever have a romance anime end right when the lovers finally confess their love after a long agonizing courting period? Ever wish to see how the lovers spend time together after their declaration of love?  That is the purpose of this uneventful anime, pure slice of life anime. It still manages to make every episode enjoyable...kinda. The ending of the last episode is incredibly open, true to the nature of the series. Truly, this anime is nothing but a slice of life - a view into the everyday lives of the characters, with no unusual problems.Although this is a sequel, expect the pacing to...be even slower than the first Ai Yori Aoshi. In fact, even less happens here than the first time, so even though you've seen the first installment of Ai Yori Aoshi I'd say this sequel probably won't add much to it. It's not bad, but definitely not as good as the original series. Not much happens other than the introduction of two new characters not seen in the original. Expect an almost complete lack of plot. This is a mellow series - even mellower than most slice-of-life - so obviously avoid if you're looking for action, intensity, and other stuff you won't find in any slice-of-life anyway.Characters are as likable as they were the first time around, so you'll like them again this time around the same way.Major points off however, since there's a lack of resolution at the end, which seemed to be something the series was hinting at the entire time at the very least. be even slower than the first Ai Yori Aoshi.

I didn\'t think it was possible! A sequel that is BETTER than the original series! Well I guess there\'s a first for everything.Story:The story picks up 2 years after the ending of Ai Yori Aoshi. Kaoru, Aoi, Tina, Taeko, Miyabi, and Chika still live together and Mayu is still the daily guest. Everybody\'s a little older but pretty much the same. There really is no time in this sequel for the story to drag as the series itself is so short, so the story moves along at a nice pace. Every character gets a ""love-episode"" with Kaoru, and each episode was very...enjoyable to watch.Art:Beautiful! Beautiful colors, beautiful animation. Just outstanding. There isn\'t as much ecchi in this season, but there still is some, but not as over-done and badly portraid as in the original. The eyecatches (the things that split the episode at where the commercial goes) run long though.Sound:The opening theme, ""Takaramono"" is just lovely. If you liked ""Towa no Hana"" then you will like this. ""Towa no Hana"" is played once during the course of the series though ;) The ending theme, ""I Do!"" isn\'t as enjoyable. The special ending theme, ""Presence"", is also decent but not my favorite.

I was really surprised that they felt they needed to make a second season with just how odd the fist one turned out. It just didn’t feel needed in my mind. It’s the same stuff that was going on in the first happening in the second. A little romance, Comedy, Drama… and Kaoru and Ai never seem to get a break.Sadly, they sometimes make Kaoru seem a bit even more like a pervert then he should. I know its normal for a guy to have those thoughts but...sometimes they make it out as though he has even more of a perverted mind at times. The sweet and innocence in the story messes up when they do that.The animation is pretty nice, pretty similar to the first one. Not much to talk about in that regard. It looks like every other romantic comedy out there. Large eyes, bright colors, nice looking girls all around one normal looking guy. Each character looks exactly like the role they are supposed to match.The dubbing is… well the same as the first again. I like that they kept it consistent but then again, they matched it way to close to the Japanese translation. Sometimes even some of the words don’t seem like they are used right.Just because it really has not changed at all, I have to give it the same rating as I did for the first.

The formula is exactly the same as the first season so I often felt bored and wanted to watch something else.The romance is very light-hearted throughout most of the show, but occasionally there are some very good moments.The harem fighting is nearly constant and you'll be able to see a different aspect of a couple of the supporting characters (Chika & Mayu).~Character 7/10~Although you do not meet new characters, the creators did deepen some of the supporting cast (Mayu and Chika) showing how...much they really do love Karou.Aoi is still the perfect wife, but it still feels like she is a stranger. Her and Karou's characters do not reach the depth needed to pull off a good romance.Overall, the character aspect was not focused on very much.~Story 5/10~This just continues the nearly random events of the first season.The focus for this show seems to be more about comedy rather than romance. Although I didn't find myself laughing much, I found myself getting bored and frustrated with the lack of direction this show takes.Besides putting a few good moments together, the rest of the show seems like useless filler.~Sound 8/10~The English dub is actually okay for this show. After watching it with both languages, the Japanese dub hits it out of the ball park. There are some great musical spots, but they are rare and far between.~Art 7/10~The art-style remained the same as the first season. However, I couldn't help but notice the higher amounts of ecchi moments.~Enjoyment 7/10~Although I do like harem fighting and arguing, I do not like dragging a simple love story over 38 episodes. With the second season I found myself getting bored and frustrated rather than actually enjoying the show. Moments became very typical as if they were following a strict formula.Overall I'll give this a 7/10.Although I didn't particularlly enjoy the show, I do appreciate the effort and challenge of making such a show.

Aoi and Kaoru. The anime revolves on this two, but this time, they were pushed in the back for the side characters. I pretty much didn\'t like this thing.When i first started to watch AYA Enishi, i was expecting an evolution of the relationship between Aoi and Kaoru. But that\'s was only a far far dream in my head (and heart). This season instead focused on the other girls of the house.In twelve episodes (plus one OAV) Aoi and Kaoru basically don\'t do anything...special or important. They are like two years ago (in the serie). The relationship doesn\'t go forward, not one step.That\'s why i had to pick a 6 this time. That\'s not a second season, that\'s more like a serie of OAV that shows the other girls\' life with Kaoru.And, obviously, the enjoyment dropped going on episode after episode. I watched the last two-three episodes bored and tired. ""Come on, next one will be better! Aoi and Kaoru will finally go over this time!"" Even if their relationship was accepted, even if Miyabi was with them... nothing important happened. Ah, disappoint.Neither a happy, funny character like Tina was able to recover this time.Story 6: not so much different from the first season, maybe even worse without all the family story.Art 6: 2003 anime, not much to say.Sound 7: i liked the soundtrack, especially the second ending song ""Presence"". Voice and other sound were good.Character 6: here too, no differences from the previous season. A little development maybe, but that\'s not enough.Enjoyment 5: went down when I begun to realize that the main story would not go where i expected (Kaoru x Aoi).Overall 6: yes, Tina and the others had the chanche to show their feelings to Kaoru.

Aoi Yori Aoshi shows that an anime doesn't  special effects or fantasies to become a masterpiece.It can say that in its genre is undoubtedly one of the best anime with a very positive message about the perseverance, the value of real friends.Positive aspects: It show the traditions...of the Japanese culture and the contrast with the modern world habits (SIMPLY I LOVE IT!!).Also it shows how hard can be the Japanese culture. I know many people love Japan and for vacations can be fantastic. However, studying, working or living there is not for everybody and I think this anime gives that message always in a positive way, of course.Despite the protagonist is an student. This is not the typical high school anime. in fact the protagonist is a university student close to graduate and with short projects in mind.Negative aspects: There were unnecessary chapters that sometimes made the story bored and there si not a conclusive ending.I know the anime was created in 2003, nevertheless at that time service that now provide Funimation, crunchyroll, VRV were not available, and as a result many great anime could conclude with a great end.

After watching it all IMO Aoi is best girl and i'm glad the MC picked her. As well as telling her he loved her along with showing Aoi how much he cared for her. The MC throughout the series was actually interesting as he didn't do what most MC's in harems do. He actually CHOSE a girl and STAYED with her. For the most part in the series the harem isn't really shoved down your throat so i'm glad for that. The animation is pretty good compared to some nowadays IMO. Seeing Aio end up with the MC...and living with him without all that needless drama you see in most anime is refreshing. Like they could have pulled some BS and made Aoi stay at her parents home for half a season as the MC tried to think of a way to get her back. But all in all this series is good. The characters have actual feelings for the most part and aren't cardboard cutouts. The MC isn't useless and the ship has sailed in a HAREM!!

It's an idol anime and the...face is like a good percentage of the selling point.With that in mind it might be a little much, but it would be nice if they put more thought in their framing so it's not all like, bam 3/4 head shots/half body shots + the little animated movement that they already cucked up on.Being super lenient and giving it a 5 for now for the potential it has in character/story and in hopes of some upgrade in the animation department. face is like a good percentage of the selling point.With that in mind it might be a little much, but it would be nice if they put more thought in their framing so it's not all like, bam 3/4 head shots/half body shots + the little animated movement that they already cucked up on.Being super lenient and giving it a 5 for now for the potential it has in character/story and in hopes of some upgrade in the animation department."", ""Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of the original game and that this anime is one of the best game adaptions I’ve seen so far.A3! is a story about friendship, overcoming hardships and chasing your dreams. Please keep in mind that if you're looking for an idol anime, A3 is not the one for you since this is about a theater group – no singing and dancing involved (unless you count the opening). The first season focuses on the characters of the Spring & Summer troupes and offers some lighthearted slice of life moments. While each of them got their...own issues and problems, they all grow over time while gaining experience; be it on the stage or in their private life. Thus, one of the biggest strengths A3 has to offer is the dynamic between the troupe members and seeing them interacting with each other.Don't expect an anime packed with action, because it's a slow-paced show with lots of conversations about the fears and wishes of the cast members, including drama and arguments. However, A3 is nothing short of comedy scenes, so you'll eventually come to love all the characters with all of their quirks and drolleries.I've been playing the game for a while now and I immediately fell in love with the story, the characters, the music and the art. While the anime is very close to the game story-wise, they added some little easter eggs and bonuses for the fans, which, obviously, you might not spot if you're not familiar with the source material. Not all game scenes are included, but they did a good job picking the ones that bring the story forward. That way, it never feels like as if they're skipping important parts or rushing through the story.Unfortunately, there is one thing I can't only say good things about. The art of the characters in the game is pretty and I’m always amazed about how much details they add to the costumes and cards. The anime, however, has some issues with the art and animations going on, even after they reworked some of it.  Movements are a bit stiff and lacking in flow at times, faces are often kind of deformed. That shouldn't ruin the enjoyment for you, especially since the characters are pretty enough once zoomed on their faces, but it can still be irritating in some scenes.All in all I can say that A3 Spring & Summer is very well-made and deserves to get a chance.

THE SHOW MUST GO ON!"", '- A fun story hidden behind less than average animation -The first thing I noticed when I started watching the first few episodes was the lackluster animation quality, and so did a lot of other people, hence the low score.But the second things I noticed were the lovable characters and the story that made this worth watching, despite the animation.I\'d played the game after watching the first few episodes before it went into its short hiatus, and sped through the Spring and Summer troupe stories and after watching the characters triumph through their struggles, I can say this:The story and characters make this anime worth...watching despite the poor animation and lackluster art.The story put in a nutshell is just as you read in the description. Our MC, Izumi, rebuilds Mankai Company while trying her best to avoid the company going under thanks to our local Yakuza dude, Sakyo.Of course, on top of that simple run-down, we have the characters\' backstories and situations to explore throughout the story as they do their best every time to put on the best show to build an audience that will support them (monetarily).Now, let\'s look at the characters.One of the best parts of the wide cast of characters is the Main Character herself. Unlike other female MCs in the genre, she\'s rich in personality. She\'s capable, mentally strong, and has actual comedic value. She serves as the perfect leading character for the other characters, who each have their own strong personalities.Some of the characters follow a lot of common tropes, but they are tropes done right and tropes that keep them interesting and their interactions definitely make it worth watching.I\'ve picked four of the characters to talk about just a little in this review that have appeared in the anime.Itaru\'s section has spoilers, so be warned.Sakuya, our main guy of the Spring troupe, is an optimistic go-getter with a strong passion for theater. He\'s very much like a typical Shounen MC, but I found him to be quite likable as I was reading the story and watching the anime. He\'s someone that makes people say, ""He\'s a good kid.""(!SPOILERS!)Itaru is a character that I, and surely many others, can relate to, to an extent. He looks like an upstanding, responsible member of society, but behind all of that is a gaming addict. His lack of motivation for anything other than games is something that hit me deep and made me feel just a little bit ashamed. Just a little, I swear.He\'s an interesting character (like most of the characters, really), and kind of punchable, in a good way.(!END OF SPOILERS!)Tenma, the lead of the Summer troupe, is a snobby rich kid with a superiority complex but (spoilers?) he Gets Better. So hold on a bit if you end up disliking him.Now Yuki may wear girly clothes (his main outfit is literally a dress), but before you start screaming ""trap,"" let me tell you this: He is not like that. That\'s why I found him so interesting as a character. I won\'t go on any more, as I don\'t want to spoil too much. I\'ll let you watch for yourself and decide what you think about his character.For the plays themselves, they are handled fantastically, and as someone who read the story in the mobage, I was really excited watching the first Spring troupe play and was pleased with how it turned out.I would definitely recommend this anime to those into theatre and plays, and for those who aren\'t, I would still recommend for the characters and story.The animation quality of the latest episode at the time of writing this review has gone up a bit compared to the previous episodes, but whether that pattern will continue is beyond me.And that concludes my review! I hope that this will convince you to give the anime a shot. There\'s a lot of other anime out there with animation just as average and just as bad, so get through it and watch it for the lovable characters. watching despite the poor animation and lackluster art.The story put in a nutshell is just as you read in the description.

So I was binged watching the anime yesterday until today at episode 11.To be honest, I do notice some animation flaws. Especially in the beginning of episode 1, the most obvious was when Izumi Tachibana's hair flow was choppy. Like if I wasn't focus on the animation, I would notice it immediately. So...I was worried if the animation studio might ruin the image I have since I am aware of how the characters are portrayed in the game. The rest are quite minor, but the noticeable errors are still there. Overall I do think it's fair since I still enjoyed it, knowing that (I won't mention his name) triangle boy still can express himself as that kind of character and his movement very well.I still like the animation, just that it could've been better and I hope it can be improved since I absolutely am a sucker for these characters from the start.

They have dramatic moments, but never to the point of melodrama. Characters--main and supporting aren't simply too good or...too evil. There is always a reason to their actions, even if one of those actions are against the main cast.

I teared up a couple of times at the writing with how well they handle the emotions of characters, and I think this is the only selling point to this series.On the other hand, the animation was boring and stiff, and there are multiple points in...the show where so little movement was happening at all that I was surprised when something moved. The show felt like a visual novel. There were sequences where characters will hold conversations off screen while we looked at a piece of background art, or characters would be talking but to skip on animating anything at all we were made to look at a still image of the character's body below the head. Comparing that to other series I have watched and it practically put me to sleep.If your show is going to have every character be attractive, the least you could do is animate them decently.This could be a good series if they animation team starts animating the characters who have so much life to them. My recommendation if you are considering watching is that this could easily be skipped, but if you feel like watching focus on the characters and their growth and try not to focus on the animation for your own sake. the show where so little movement was happening at all that I was surprised when something moved.

I think if they slowed the pace down it wouldn't be as annoying to tell them apart since you'll get to know them better.Storywise it is ok. I like the entire theatre troupe idea with a landowner watching down upon them (with sneering eyes that are hiding his passion) but it feels like the characters are just gonna get disposed of every time a new troupe comes along. There are some scenes where the characters express emotions and they all deal with them together, but then they get ruined when the characters get replaced. to get to know them well.The animation is alright although the character designs need to have some sort of quirky attributes like crazy hair or emo glasses just to spice it up.

The storyline was consistent, the art was amazing and I have to admit the op end ep was very suitable to the overall theme and feels of the anime.Though there are a few things I personally didn\'t enjoy.One would be the director\'s character was very mundane and lacked charisma. To put it bluntly, the show wouldn\'t change whether she was there or not. Her lines are mundane and it didn\'t make me feel like ""I want to follow her"". She didn\'t really leave much of an impression on...me which was a huge waste as I felt that if her character was done right, the show would have a much stronger impact.Two. It would have been nice if there was more story to the backgrounds of the characters. The backstory were all either very brief or just nonexistent. Their reasons for joining the troupe was very flimsy as well, it was as if the team had a ""whatever works"" attitude and just smacked it right into the story.Lastly, there also wasn\'t much shown on how the characters struggled to keep up with their ""double life"" and that made it lack the ""real life"" aspect which made it hard for me to sympathise with the characters. All of the struggles they faced were solely on acting and yes I get that it\'s the entirety of the show but as I mentioned, it didn\'t have that ""reality"" aspect to it and that made it hard for me to connect well with the characters.Overall, the storyline was great but there are definitely areas that could have made it better. I love the art style and the animation was amazing, not to mention the colour scheme was very pretty as well, I love how each character had their own unique style to them and it was very easy to distinguish as well. I don\'t have to comment on the sound, the op and ep even the background music made it easy for me to understand the atmosphere and got me excited when the characters acted on stage.This is a good anime to watch if you\'re in it to please your eyes but story and character-wise, I think more improvement could have been made. me which was a huge waste as I felt that if her character was done right, the show would have a much stronger impact.Two.

The pacing is alright and so is the concept but it\'s nothing too special. It reminds me of every other idol anime i\'ve watched so far (like ""Uta no Prince Sama"" and ""Love Live! School Idol Project""). The twist that the characters are trying to become actors instead of idols, is in my opinion, not that big of a changeArtIt\'s alright. the art is neither the best nor the worst i\'ve ever seen. It\'s basically nothing too special and if i\'m...being honest, very rough around the edges...CharactersThe Characters are... let\'s say meh. There are the basic type of guys, e. g. Tsundere, Deredere, a NEET, a foreigner, the mature one, a shy guy... It\'s once again nothing too special. The characters even seem rather flat, there\'s simply not a lot of development happening. Sure, the shy one becomes slightly more comfortable around the group and opens up and the ""mean/Tsundere"" type becomes more friendly but that\'s it. One\'s whole character trait is that he likes triangles and i don\'t think there\'s anything else to him…OverallIf i\'m being honest, i don\'t know what this anime is trying to be. Is it trying to be a re-harem? i don\'t know. Is it trying to suggest that all the characters are gay without showing it (like ""Free!"")? i don\'t know. I don\'t think i would recommend this anime to someone else. It feels like it\'s trying to be too many things/establish too many characters at once. Maybe it\'s a nice thing for people who\'ve played the game and know more about the different characters but since i don\'t have this experience, i can only see the characters and the story as flat.. :/ being honest, very rough around the edges...CharactersThe Characters are... let\'s say meh.

The game is fine on its own, the otome genre never interested me but the game wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I finished the anime a few months ago and I was like you know what? I'm gonna write a review on it. Now is this adaption faithful to its original source? And for the sake of this review, I'll be referring as harem anime with a female lead involved with male characters as otome.Story: 6The story is simple yet a bit cliché to...me, theater is in debt and our fellow main character decides to help, and meets a group of eccentric male actors. To me it's cliché because it just sounds like your typical otome anime plot. Another reason why it doesn't really appeal to me is that its centered with acting and theater, so maybe theater anime fans will enjoy this.Art: 5.5-6Look I get it, due to covid-19 being at its peak the anime got a huge quality drop. The animation got choppy at times, it used frames that were already used, and it's nothing that impressive. I wasn't surprised by it, it's not an action or fantasy anime, which it usually has amazing animation. The artstyle to me is nothing special, it's just your average otome artstyle.Sound: 6.5One of the things I think this anime did a good with was the opening, it got annoying at times but its pretty okay. It's nice to see that the voice actors of the game sing, and speaking of the voice actors I want to tackle one thing that bothered me while watching it, the voice acting. The characters' voices in the game are good, not outstanding, but they aren't terrible either. But characters voices like Misumi's kinda bothered me with all the voice cracks. The voice acting isn't impressing, but it's passable.Characters: 7Now let's talk about my favorite thing about this anime, the characters. They act just like how they act in the game. In the Spring Troupe we got Sakuya, the troupe leader who just wants to act, Masumi, who has an obsession with the director (who by the way he's like 16 and the director is on her twenties), Tsuzuru, who writes the plays, Citron, an immigrant, and Itaru, an office worker who secretely streams him playing videogames at midnight. The reason why I say why the characters are my favorite thing from this anime is mostly because of Citron, he's hilarious and deserves more, Itaru is also likeable. But then there's characters like Tsuzuru who I found annoying as hell from the beginning, but the rest of the boys are okay. Then there's the Summer Trouble, which has a crazier cast of characters, Tenma, a former actor, Yuki, a crossdresser who makes costumes for the plays, Muku, a shojo manga fanatic, Misumi, a man obsessed with triangles, and Kazunari, who's obsessed with social media. The summer troupe is definitely more energetic than the spring troupe.Enjoyment: 7If you aren't into harem anime then this is not your cup of tea. However, I recommend this one over other harem anime, as person who dislikes harem anime with a cast of boring male characters I found A3 to be quite enjoyable. Of course if you're the opposite of me and enjoy harem with a passion, then you'll definitely like this.Overall: 6Does this anime adaption remains loyal to its original game? Yes, I think it does. If you haven't played the game would you like this? Depends on your current anime taste. The second season is gonna be out in a few days and I hope it does better, but just by watching the trailer it feels like it's gonna be the same as the first season. All we can do is hope it's better animation wise.Thank you for reading my review!

Does it have the best animation, or the most solid plotline? No, not by far - but if you enjoy a little tomfoolery and a whole bunch of pretty boys, I'd say go give it a watch.Now to delve into it a bit deeper; A3!'s about a theater that's about to be demolished when director Tachibana stops it and promises the owner that she'll make the company profitable by the end of next year. And so starts a rotation where each 6 episodes 5 new guys prepare for a theater...play and eventually perform it. Now you might say, 5 guys per 6 episodes and 2 seasons, that's... 20 guys? Isn't that a lot? Yes. Yes it's an awful lot. This also means that a lot of them miss some depth, with the exception of the main characters. Now this may objectively be a bad thing, but personally I greatly enjoyed how little these guys are expanded upon. In one of the episodes (minor spoiler ahead) we find out that one of the characters is actually being tailed by a foreign organisation. Do we ever learn more about his past or is there any follow-up on it after this information is revealed? Absolutely not. One character just really likes triangles, that's it. That's his personality. He's my favorite. Another character has lost his memory and all the others pretend this is perfectly normal and fine, and just invite him to live and act with them. Maybe it was not meant to be comedy, but it was amazingly hilarious to me. The main characters' backstories are fleshed out a little more and are pretty decent - I wouldn't call them special but they were enjoyable to watch. I also liked the personal relationships between all of the actors, a big part of the plot is based on their forming friendships.The designs of the boys are pretty fun. Cool clothes, different (hair) colors and generally just nice characters to see. The animation isn't exactly up to 2020 standards, so if that's something that bothers you maybe stay away from this anime. I've seen worse, but it's definitely choppy compared to a lot of anime airing at that time. The voice acting is solid, which is nice since the whole series is about acting. I was honestly kind of surprised at the level of professionalism coming from what seemed like a low-budget project otherwise. Oh, and the opening is a banger.Overall, I would recommend A3! if you're looking for something relaxing and not-too-deep to watch. It has fun characters and an enjoyable but sometimes little ridiculous plot. Plus a little bit of secondhand embarassment here and there when they're street performing.

If not, stay far away.This anime shows the typical otome plot line, and every objective review for them may as well be recycled for this one. I guess I\'ve grown out of this phase since I enjoyed the titles I mentioned above back when I was younger, but I found myself having a hard time finishing this one as I go on. Maybe it\'s just not my cup of tea anymore.It does meet the expectations of what it\'s marketed...for, so I don\'t want to be too harsh on it. The ikemen are as you\'d expect them to be. The MC is a slight breath of fresh air--her fate as the character who ""changes the life of every guy in her harem which makes everyone absolutely adore her"" is unfortunately sealed as expected, but compared to most MCs from older titles, she has her cheeky moments. It\'s a nice change despite being a small one.What I really appreciate are: (1) acting as the main focus instead of being an idol, and (2) the music. I like that only a facet of being an idol (and not even putting much emphasis on fame and huge productions) is where the main plot revolves on, and I did enjoy the opening and ending themes. I won\'t be able to comment on other soundtracks since I tend to pause often and not notice them at all.The art style ranges from simple to unique, which is a plus, however the animation really does fall flat. I wish they invested more time on that instead of the small movements and declaring them ""good enough!"" as they shut down their computers and end their day.All in all, it delivers what it says it will. Pretty okay for an adaptation of an otome game. If this is your style, go for it, I\'d bet you\'ll enjoy it. It just isn\'t for me now, sadly. for, so I don\'t want to be too harsh on it.

I can\'t think of better ways to set the mood other than a pacific and emotional background music to the crew\'s letter writing, which also fit each character\'s personalities well.

B'T X Neo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1736/BT_X_Neo,"[""I'm surprised no one else has written a review for this yet.B'T X Neo, the sequel to B'T X, is by far much better than it's predecessor.The story takes the original premise and dives much deeper into a darker, more exciting plot.It follows on Teppei's quest to defeat the Machine Empire and save his Damsel-man in distress brother. If it stopped just at that, I'd have chucked my copy in the bin, BUT, instead it works on fleshing out our characters. We delve into their pasts, into their relationships. We look into the dark past of the Machine Empire, of the war, of the reasons...and the motivations our Heroes draw strength from.Sounds cliche right? But it isn't. It's dark, bloody, and damn straight depressing. But it's GOOD.Story: 10/10Travelling towards the climax of the story, the writers have managed to insert an intensely epic atmosphere into the original story. It's what classics are made of.The religious undertones provide a kind of mythical, mysterious darkness to the story. You start to question humanity, you start to question what is right and what is wrong. The great thing about this story is that it doesn't beat you over the head with either. You can choose to watch this philosophically, or you can equally switch your brain off and watch it for sheer excitement/enjoyment....I did both former and latter from time to time.It also has heaps of twists and turns that sort of leave you jaw-dropped for a second or two. For me personally there were also heaps of heart-wrenching moments that really made me want to curl into a corner and cry my eyes out. If an anime can do that, you know you've got something good.Art: 9/10Improved from the prequel. You'll find the colours are more striking and the detail better.Sound: 10/10OST still kicks ass.Enjoyment: 10/10Improved significantly. The twists and turns keep you addicted and as with the prequel --you never know who's going to win (in the long run I mean).Overall: 10/10Fan-f***ing-tastic. Epic. Classic. Exciting. Thrilling.

You'll find the colours are more striking and the detail better.Sound: 10/10OST still kicks ass.Enjoyment: 10/10Improved significantly. The twists and turns keep you addicted and as with the prequel --you never know who's going to win (in the long run I mean).Overall: 10/10Fan-f***ing-tastic. Epic. Classic. Exciting. Thrilling. Funny. Heart-warming/wrenching. EMOTIVE (which is always a good thing)."", ""the story picks off from the t.v serie´s wich goes in a far darker tone and more serious  aswel the plot directs in a very twisted and acceptable closure. seems many ppl haven´t heard the ova´s or seen it ( yes its oldskool, deal with it ). I liked the t.v series a lot, but the ova a lot more. New charachters that appears in the scene, both good and bad, each having a story to tell about their past and stuff wich in not like a no brainer  putted in just to fill it all up or rush it, no its quite...well done and tought through. same for the new apprerances of  mystical/-like-mecha creatures. i don't remember much of the ova's , but Pegasus gets and powerfull upgrade and the Original owner returns wich develop in an sort of dissapointment between the owner and the current holder of Pegasus, wich Black Pegasus comes into the story.I like the nice 'superhero' intro that fitted, very good background animation and little to non pussy chara. that annoys you in the show. and it has some funny moments ofc. well done and tought through. same for the new apprerances of  mystical/-like-mecha creatures. i don't remember much of the ova's , but Pegasus gets and powerfull upgrade and the Original owner returns wich develop in an sort of dissapointment between the owner and the current holder of Pegasus, wich Black Pegasus comes into the story.I like the nice 'superhero' intro that fitted, very good background animation and little to non pussy chara. that annoys you in the show. and it has some funny moments ofc."", ""B'T X Neo is the continuation of the first two seasons and concludes the story of the anime with a third season. As such, there are many similarities to the previous part although some sections differ highly, it still feels like the former part, and not in a good way.Story: 2Animation: 3Sound: 5Characters: 2Enjoyment: 3Total: 2In comparison, and partly because of the concluded nature, I can safely say that B'T X Neo is worse than its unfinished predecessor. The bad and boring section are drawn out more and character development comes to a halt for the main cast as it is already concluded in the...previous seasons. But the above scores can also be used for the totality of the whole anime; and here is why.Let's start with the story structure and action. As mentioned in my previous review, the story is a monster-of-the-week style gauntlet for the main cast to fight through. Most of them went for 2 episodes and in Neo partly for 3. The biggest problem this show has is that the action is stiff. Because it always boils down to when can the main character hit the enemy. At first and in every fight they are caught off-guard by some mystical power from the enemy, but after they can overcome it, he punches so enemy so hard that he retires.And for a show mostly about robots and the technical advancement of humanity, magic power are everywhere. At first they at least try to explain of how they function, but they give up half way and energy beams out of thin air are on the daily norm.In general, the show lacks explanations. The big bad of the show is essentially the blob and punching him doesn't do much. The evil behind the blob has never any text to speak and only appears as a shadow in a flashback. His motives are mostly communicated by his ministers who run most of the empire he controls.And I have to talk about the plans of the bad guys here, because it makes no freaking sense.<Spoilers onward here>A Lieutenant of the empire captures scientists around the globe to figure out how to defeat the blob they created as he seems invincible to all weapons. The few cases we get to see they demand an audience with the emperor but only get to see the ministers. This point makes no sense. Why would they even allow outsiders into their heart and not kill them right on the spot? All of them gets sent into a forced labor camp underground, but the empire also seem to have a giant amount of staff to spend. So instead they keep them alive which ultimately bites them back, because we can't have a main character be killed in the first 6 episodes. Since the camp is full of scientist slaves this scenario happened at least 100+ times. Why was the lieutenant still in her job?And this problematic of internal logic is flawed in many instances. For example: a scientist for robotics and mathematics solve chemical biology by themselves when they probably have someone for that on site.Or: At first it is said that the blob cannot be harmed by anything. Later everything seems to be capable of destroying large chunks of him.<Spoilers end here.>Consistency is generally flawed within this anime. Large distances stretch in and out for conveniences sake and how the plot requires it.What is also somewhat interesting is, that the plot structure is very similar to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. A Monster-of-the-Week show with magical abilities mostly set in a desert to fight the big bad evil at the end to save a relative while the main character mostly punches the evil guys. The original manga run also started a few years after JoJo Part 3. The main difference, however, would be the main cast size. Due to the large cast of 5 main members JoJo avoids staleness in its fights. There are only so many ways you can punch someone. B'T X Neo fails to deliver of that front completely. Fights are dull and the action is repeated by concept every single time. Also, the ability to fly is completely underutilized and only serves as means of travel.Animation-wise there were some improvements. However still-shots are still used massively and obvious errors still pop up every so often. Sometimes in company with disfigured character models.The sound is fine for most of the parts and serves its duty.In total B'T X Neo continues on the trend of its previous two seasons. Flat action combined with flat characters and an underwhelming story which is surprisingly capable of missing everything it throws before its own feet. There are oh so many sections where characters could've been developed from in massive ways, but they always ignore those situations. Ultimately this anime is about ... something... I guess to not lose hope so the Deus ex Machina can fall into his hands? Honestly, there are many themes presented in the anime, but, as mentioned earlier, none are resolved in any satisfying measure. It blindly waddles through this sea of plot holes and lack of logic towards something that resembles probably one of the worst endings I've ever seen. previous seasons.

Biohazard: Damnation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9544/Biohazard__Damnation,"['I have to say this was a very interesting Movie.The Story in Resident Evil: Damnation ""Biohazard"" I gave it a 9 out of 10Because well their were some suspense that I never have guess would ever happen.The Art of the movie I gave it a 9 out of 10Because it look way better than the previous one...Leon look very good like in the gamesThe Sound was a 8 out of 10It was an okay sound in the movie and I expected a little more...The Characters I gave it a 10 out 10I say the characters were pretty amazing I do wish we see more of them in the future.and well this movie was one of the best Resident Evil movie I have watch I do recommend every Resident Evil Fan to watch this amazing film.~This is my first Review~ The Characters I gave it a 10 out 10I say the characters were pretty amazing I do wish we see more of them in the future.and well this movie was one of the best Resident Evil movie I have watch I do recommend every Resident Evil Fan to watch this amazing film.~This is my first Review~', ""That was..... actually pretty good : OWell i expected nothing but disappointment from this movie, i scored degeneration a 4, and didn't see what was going to be much different in this one from the clips i'd seen.Following on roughly from around the events of resident evil 4, the story follows Leon (of RE2 and 4) as he continues his adventures as an American spy/super special solder of some sorts. He ends up in some obscure soviet resembling war zone, amidst freedom fighters and government soldiers, with rumblings of monsters being involved in the fighting.If you've seen any cgi game adaptation made in the last...few years, the art and sound are going to be entirely familiar, its the same stuff used in exactly the same way. In fairness, they don't slaughter the facial animations in the way degeneration and tekken did, and generally it all works. I watched the dub, which is not the norm for me, but proved to be sufficient, fairly sure Ada and Leon are voiced by their game VA's so all good on that front.Content wise, the films starts off very poorly, all of the freedom fighters made me want to self harm, as soon as they starting spewing dialogue, and the plot seemed ridiculous as expected from anything from RE these days.Do not fear, it does infact come together towards the mid sections, and builds up to a dam right impressive finale. What was particularly satisfying was after all the early games going on about the various viruses, being used to create bio weapons, only for them to continually get defeated in their beta stages by single human opponents, we do actually get to see monsters deployed in a war zone, and they actually work well. Getting to see the perfect form tyrants in action was particularly satisfying, i was almost in awe when the first one showed up.Overall, if you have any remaining love for RE give this a watch, at least as good as the 2nd Final fantasy cgi movie, if not the best cgi movie made. few years, the art and sound are going to be entirely familiar, its the same stuff used in exactly the same way.

Also, the version I watched is the original japanese one.Animation:1) the visuals look a lot better compared to the prequel but then again that\'s to be expected since they\'re 4 years apart.2) there\'s actual horror and a tense atmosphere that doesn\'t exist at all in the prequel. Although it\'s only in the 1st part of the film, it did make me feel that I was watching a Resident Evil movie.3) there\'s a few recycled scenes that are...easily noticeable and that broke the immersion for me.4) this will sound like a joke but I\'m serious about this: Leon\'s butt looks so weird in this film.Sound:1) I really liked the seiyuus performance2) I think the overal sound design fit the animation and story events3) although I watched the japanese version, I had access to the english dub lines and I can tell you that the japanese version has no sexist or cringe remarks from any character.Story and characters:1) This movie starts off with an explanation of the political situation that\'s happening where the story takes place. This is a sequence of images and narrration that aren\'t exactly exciting and when it ends, obviously you are expecting the story to begin. It does begin but it keeps getting interrupted by these obnoxious screens giving credit to producers, actors, etc. and it really pissed me off. Every movie likes to do a short credits introduction quickly after it starts but the way it was done on this film is really infuriating.2) JD was a terrible annoying character and his story is as predictable as it gets3) SPOILER: Ada Wong\'s presence on this movie felt more like an Easter Egg  rather than an actual role. I mean, her action scene with the President was phenomenal but I think it would\'ve been better if she had a more active role in the plot.4) I need to explain something here: I was ready to give this movie an 8 out of 10 but as you can see by now, that\'s clearly not what happened. So what went wrong? What went wrong was the entire ending section of the movie. SPOILERS: Buddy is struggling with the virus and is one jump away from the safety of a ladder. Between jumping to Leon\'s hand or the ladder, it was way easier to land on the ladder but I guess it\'s not a ""murican"" film unless you get some anti-hero bromance between the alpha males. A few scenes later, they\'re outside and are being chased by one Tyrant. At some point, we see Leon reloading his Machine Gun and he fires 6 shots (I counted them) against this flammable tank in order to defeat the Tyrant. As a result, the Tyrant ""evolves"" into a naked warmachine. Shortly after, the Tyrant deflects a rocket and Leon almost gets hit with it. Although Leon gets caught up by the explosion, a quick roll makes him look like it was just a bit of wind when he should\'ve been launched meters away. This is the moment where the Tyrant punches Leon in the air, grabs him mid-air and throws him at a building. The way that this scene was animated makes it impossible for Leon (or any other human) to survive that impact. The very first time after this that Leon gets a chance to fire his machine gun against the Tyrant... he\'s out of bullets. Yes, this man reloads a full machine gun magazine and after 6 shots fired, it\'s empty. Eventually Buddy and Leon manage to defeat the Tyrant with a tank and the President sends two more ""evolved"" Tyrants after them. Because Buddy is struggling with the virus and Leon has no ammo (and for an unexplained reason the tank is not in firing condition), Leon decides to carry him while these two Tyrants are literally running their grey asses off after them. There\'s a visual that makes it clear that the two Tyrants are (obviously) catching up to them very quickly. Then we get to watch a scene with the President and then we\'re back to Leon and Buddy. The two Tyrants aren\'t running anymore but rather slowly walking towards them from two complete different directions (which wasn\'t the case in the previous scene) and as the ""death of Leon"" is about to occur... an airplane just shoots and absolutely destroys both Tyrants , Leon recognizes that the airplanes are from his secret service buddies that have been following him all along. So, you\'re telling me that the secret services have been watching Leon almost die several times against the first Tyrant but they didn\'t do anything until the two Tyrants caught up to him? Also, the projectiles fired by the airplane would\'ve caused a massive explosion and so Leon should\'ve been caught in it but yet, there\'s this massive plot armor that keeps breaking immersion. Also, remember how Buddy is infected by a virus? The smart choice would be to put him out of his misery and he himself asks Leon to kill him. Leon decides do ignore him and Buddy gets his pistol out and aims at his chin. This is when Leon snaps like an idiot and gives out a speech stating that the moment you grab a gun is the moment that you forfeit any right to taking your own life, even if you find yourself in a situation where you\'re physically paralized. This phrase is stupid no matter who says it BUT THE FACT THAT LEON, THE MAN WHO IS AN EXPERT AT THESE TYPES OF VIRUSES AND SPENDS EVERY MOVIE SAYING ""SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD, THEY\'RE NOT HUMAN, BLA BLA BLA"" is the one that ends up shooting Buddy in such a way THAT CAUSES BUDDY TO LIVE IN A WHEELCHAIR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WITH THE VIRUS INSIDE HIM. I\'m so angry. I\'m sure you can tell by how much I typed.Whether you read or not the last spoiler I wrote about, the reason why I give this movie such a low score of 3/10 is because the ending just completely destroyed what it was being an awesome Resident Evil experience for me. easily noticeable and that broke the immersion for me.4) this will sound like a joke but I\'m serious about this: Leon\'s butt looks so weird in this film.Sound:1) I really liked the seiyuus performance2) I think the overal sound design fit the animation and story events3) although I watched the japanese version, I had access to the english dub lines and I can tell you that the japanese version has no sexist or cringe remarks from any character.Story and characters:1) This movie starts off with an explanation of the political situation that\'s happening where the story takes place.

Leon goes in alone and gets captured by the people he came there to stop. I guess the only thing real different is that they found something that controls the creatures to a point. We have all of the characters from Leon’s side of the storyline like the ‘bombshell’ Ada Wong to Leon Kennedy and Ingrid Hunnigan. And even in all of this, they have new characters that actually are loveable even if they don’t stay for very long.The problems I have with the show are actually rather minimal but the ending feels as though it was...extremely predictable. We have a large fight going with a ‘new’ form of strong bio-weapon, and a facility that is about to go through genetic cleansing. Then we have the ‘boss’ fight with multiple stages to him.It’s interesting that they used images of Resident Evil 6 in the ending theme but if you haven’t played the game, your left wondering what the reasoning was for it. I know I may be reviewing these shows out of order but a good movie normally has something that helps even new watchers understand what’s going on.Wow, the animation actually looks so much better then what they had in Degeneration. It’s much more fluid and the characters look much more realistic without going over the boundaries of the game style. We even get the exploding heads of the zombie people that I bet those who have played the games hate. One of my favorite points is when they go into first person view because it looks so much like the real thing (When I mean real thing, I mean both game and real life horror shows). The points I do hate is that they actually show someone getting forced into one of the zombies. Whenever I see someone forcing those… things… into someone’s mouth, I always end up gagging a bit. I also hate the slow motion times they use although it’s used quite sparingly in this one. The textures are good except the fact that all the men seem to have lip-gloss or lip stick on their lips.The English voices are pretty good and you can most of the time tell who is American and who is from the Soviet Union. Characters actually sound close to what they were in the games and I believe its because they are the same voice actors but could be wrong. The music was also rather well done and worked to the movies advantage. extremely predictable.

If you played previous RE games you will notice a lot of scenes copied from games. Story is poor written, characters are very cartoonish and uninteresting. Its like 99 percent of Leon being cool, Ada being bitch and monsters all around. Action scenes are great and sound effects are good. If you are Resident Evil fan and looking for mindless fun, this one is for you. ', 'After the most passable and silly Degeneration, comes the second CGI film titled Damnation. Assuming you already read what I said about the previous movie, I will not repeat myself and will mention only the aesthetic differences in this one.PRODUCTION VALUES-The CGI quality has improved slightly in motions and lip-sync. It also feels far darker, bloodier, and grittier.-The setting is more interesting as it takes place in a war zone located in a city. No more silly fluffy areas and annoying civilians running around.- Voice acting is laughable, especially for Leon. I mean, come on, it’s like he didn’t even care to perform.SCRIPT-The story moves...away from the style of the first three movies, which was basically a zombie epidemic in a civilized area with some secret laboratories. It moves to the later trilogy, where there are no innocents. The civilians are all hostile and in this case, armed and dangerous, plus the whole place is in the middle of a civil war.-There are technically no zombies in this film but rather possessed people. The result is pretty much the same but surely, it looks closer to tentacle monsters using human hosts.-This time it is not so much about evil multi-national organizations trying to take over the world with bioorganic weapons. It is a lot more about localized political intrigue, and messages around terrorism and wars for natural resources. I must say it made the set up to feel far more realistic and interesting.-Of course they hardly do anything smart with the whole thing. It’s still gust a slugfest to the most part with the resolution being weak and almost anti-climactic. But at least it gives you the impression that the villains got away and almost won. It made it feel catchier this way.-There are Tyrants as bosses. We can’t do without them. Only this time they are mass produced and felt like they were beaten easily by mooks. Lame!CAST-Leon grows a goatee and looks even more badass now. Other than that, he acts extremely uncaring and spouts lots of lame one-liners.-No more of that bimbo Claire, thank God. Now we get Ada Wong being badass, manipulative, and even taking part in a cat fight. Now that’s more like it!-Some rebels are in this movie and try to offer drama by mentioning how the stronger countries are manipulating them for resources and now that they resist decided to wipe them out. They could have made something interesting out of this but in just half an hour you stop caring about them, since the plot is basically Leon walking around and killing mutants. Very weak presence and importance.-There is a politician present again, only this time it’s not a weak fat cliché asshole. This one was smart, cunning, strong, and willing to do all it takes to have it her way. Yes, she is a woman to boot.-And then we have undead… sort of. Closer to mutated bio-weapons in the form of Crimson Heads and Lickers. And apparently this time they are controlled telepathetically by a human who acts as a bee queen or something.

It moves to the later trilogy, where there are no innocents. The civilians are all hostile and in this case, armed and dangerous, plus the whole place is in the middle of a civil war.-There are technically no zombies in this film but rather possessed people. The result is pretty much the same but surely, it looks closer to tentacle monsters using human hosts.-This time it is not so much about evil multi-national organizations trying to take over the world with bioorganic weapons. It is a lot more about localized political intrigue, and messages around terrorism and wars for natural resources. I must say it made the set up to feel far more realistic and interesting.-Of course they hardly do anything smart with the whole thing. It’s still gust a slugfest to the most part with the resolution being weak and almost anti-climactic. But at least it gives you the impression that the villains got away and almost won. It made it feel catchier this way.-There are Tyrants as bosses. We can’t do without them. Only this time they are mass produced and felt like they were beaten easily by mooks. Lame!CAST-Leon grows a goatee and looks even more badass now. Other than that, he acts extremely uncaring and spouts lots of lame one-liners.-No more of that bimbo Claire, thank God. Now we get Ada Wong being badass, manipulative, and even taking part in a cat fight. Now that’s more like it!-Some rebels are in this movie and try to offer drama by mentioning how the stronger countries are manipulating them for resources and now that they resist decided to wipe them out. They could have made something interesting out of this but in just half an hour you stop caring about them, since the plot is basically Leon walking around and killing mutants. Very weak presence and importance.-There is a politician present again, only this time it’s not a weak fat cliché asshole. This one was smart, cunning, strong, and willing to do all it takes to have it her way. Yes, she is a woman to boot.-And then we have undead… sort of. Closer to mutated bio-weapons in the form of Crimson Heads and Lickers. And apparently this time they are controlled telepathetically by a human who acts as a bee queen or something. It was an interesting twist to the mindless hordes of monsters up to now but still complete mooks to the plot.-Overall, the second film had a smaller and more interesting cast, though clearly in terms of coolness and not depth.LEGACY-It is surely better than the first, less of a Romero rip-off, and more of an attempt at delving into politics and conspiracies.

Some decent action scenes with solid animation, along with relevant themes and a story deeper than what you would expect from this kind of title.However, I can't guarantee those who aren't RE films that this will persuade them to play some of the most classic horror survival games in the industry. There are problems with this film, It lacks any meaningful character development (atleast for the main cast) it's art direction and sound are minor at best and the story is actually good....for an RE game, but it doesn't reinvent the wheel here. The  dialogue also feels very minimal, with our main hero Leon dishing out one liners and not saying much else....but hey, Hannigan is really cute in those glasses. I do think this was a missed opportunity somewhat to dive deeper into Leon and Ada Wong's characters in what is ultimately a set up for RE6. The story here has no relevancy within the RE timeline, so really this should have focused more on the characters personal conflicts, something they tried yet completely fucked up in Vendetta.Overall, not really much to say. RE fans shouldn't give this a miss, and those who aren't will probably think this is another mediocre 3D animation action pictures. into the mix.

One will only like it if they have come to see pretty leon and his one-liners out of nowhere. (I admit I'm one of them)1. The plot  (a little spoil just in number one)When it ended, I only had one question. Why did leon do? All he did was running around killing a bunch of b.o.ws but nothing more. He has no effect and practically no purpose through the whole story. If he was there or not, everything would've happened the same way. Ada would still steal what she wanted and the government would've been...taken down by the russia and america. He just saved that poor man and then paralyzed him at the end.At least Ada had a purpose and she nailed it.Also at the beginning leon goes on about killing the people who are injected then refuses to kill some one who is injected2. The musicNothing interesting really. It wasn't very good. Just one ost that was boring. And as the  background music was not very engaging? I mean it wasn't good and it didn't add up to the tension.3. CharactersWell, they had a backstory at least, but a very cliche one.4. AnimationIt was the best part of the movie. It looked ahead of its time. But the problem is at some points it was very dark I couldn't even see what was happening. The half of the movie was like this and I was glad for some sunlight at the final scenes.5. Being unrealisticWhenever leon is about to be killed, he's saved by some character or planes or whatever. It makes him look lucky rather than stron. And like he just wouldn't die even if a bunch of bombs hits right near his face.Conclusion:It was nice to see the chemistry between Ada and Leon and it's always entertaining watching leon kill some monsters. and the animation was good.

Only negative thing I could say is this is a hard recommendation to give to someone who hasn't played the resident evil games because some of it is fanservice and some things aren't explained only if you played the resident evil games.  It also seems as well as kind of predictable character being introduced and dying...at the start is kind of a trope with these 2 first movies like the soldier sacrificing himself at the start of RE Degeneration and JD dying near the start in this as well. at the start is kind of a trope with these 2 first movies like the soldier sacrificing himself at the start of RE Degeneration and JD dying near the start in this as well.""]"

Allotted only 10 episodes for a Manga with over 30 chapters is a crime. Sadly as a result the Anime was pushed for time, and rushed through the Manga. After hearing this I gave the Manga a shot, and enjoyed it greatly. Bundled with the new Manga chapter arrived this new OVA which is a continuation of the show. From a fan I was glad to get more of a show that didn't really have a fair shot. Here is my review.Story: 6With this OVA we now have new outing with Staz and Fuyumi. Nothing really special...in terms of a riveting story, but non the less another fun adventure. A new episode a new set of bad guys for Staz to destroy (because he is kind of broken now). Nothing more to really say except I had fun. It was brief, but for a show that already had a very short run time I really appreciated this.Art: 7The original show was never a fantastic looking one, but for me at least it had a charm. A bright, colorful animation style really worked for the original shows benefit, and that doesn't change here. If anything I would say the animation is better here. Specially the fights that occur. Seeing Staz unleash more of his awakened Vampire power from the show was a fun site indeed.Sound: 6Nothing really special in this department. Hearing the original voice cast another time was fun, and hearing the opening role again was a treat. Sadly nothing really substantial in terms of OST. It is only one episode tho so it isn't to big of a problem.Character: 7Seeing Staz again is fantastic as always, and Fuyumi was nice. The new cast members were alright. Nothing really special, but they were mindlessly entertaining. This score primarily comes from seeing Staz again. I have always found him incredibly fun and entertaining. He isn't the greatest character in the world, but I do love him.Enjoyment: 8As you can tell I'm a fan, and having more is never a bad thing.Overall: 6.8If you are a fan of the Manga or of the original series then I recommend giving this a watch. I appreciate having more Blood Lad in my life, and this was what the doctor ordered. It isn't completing the show, but merely just providing more.

Captain Future,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2561/Captain_Future,"[""It is rather surprising that there was no review yet about what is considered a monument of Japanese animation in the eighties : millions of kids in Europe and South America have watched Captain Future (AKA Capitaine Flam) with passion. The theme (specific for each country) was even on the charts and I do remember hearing it in disco as well!But let's get back to the review. The Story is based on a SF space opera work written by Edmond Hamilton in the 40s and 50s and published in SF pulp magazine. It depicts, in a distant future,  the adventure...of a young scientist and adventurer Captain Future and his companions whom always assist the earth government regarding impossible missions or strange phenomenons occurring on other planets.Based on written work and the optimistic elan of the 40s, the story is the strong asset of this anime. Each story is independent and span over 3 or 4 episodes thus giving time for development and suspense. The main character will be confronted with great and original foes and will have to solve enigmas based sometimes on scientific, pseudoscientific theories or concept : dimension travel, space travel, the infinitesimal world, immortality... Love is not forgotten as our hero will have to rescue the charming Johanne.By today's standard, art and animation are the downsides of this anime produced at the end of the seventies. Dull animation, sometimes flashy or awkward color palette. For me it is not a problem but I understand it could be difficult for younger generation. But don't let this drawback prevent you from watching this compelling anime although!If you like Jazz music with soul/funk rhythm no doubt that will appreciate the score from Yūji Ōno (Lupin III, Edgar Detective Cambrioleur). Jazz is rather rare nowadays in anime.Most characters are well conceived and they have their own originality and specific powers (I was amazed by the Professor living brain!). It is easy to identify with them and feel some empathy towards their ordeals.The French dubbing had involved professional Theater actors voices (especially Philippe Ougouz) and are consequently very enjoyable. The German Dubbing seems well made as well. I do not know about the Italian and Spanish dubbing maybe some of you can tell us.  Curiously (If I am correct) only 8 episodes were dubbed in English...Overall, if you are able to overcome the aged art, you will discover a jewel of space opera SF and compelling epic adventures. of a young scientist and adventurer Captain Future and his companions whom always assist the earth government regarding impossible missions or strange phenomenons occurring on other planets.Based on written work and the optimistic elan of the 40s, the story is the strong asset of this anime.

Chirin no Suzu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2199/Chirin_no_Suzu,"[""I had never heard of this movie before 2009, and the only way I heard about it was through Anime News Network, via an entry in Justin Sevakis' Buried Treasure column. I really liked reading the Buried Treasure columns on there, as it introduced me to anime that I adore to this day, Ringing Bell being one of them. Unfortunately it has since been abandoned. But my curiosity was piqued, I tracked it down on YouTube, and watched the English dub, as it was the only version available back then. Wow, Ringing Bell is seriously one of the darkest, most mature kids movies I've ever...seen. It's full of mature life lessons most kids movies today refuse to even touch upon, and I'm sure something like this would be reviled at today. But I actually love it for its maturity and refusal to dumb itself down for its audience.The story is very simple. A young lamb named Chirin loves playing in the farm and being with his mother, even though he doesn't always listen to her. But one day, a wolf breaks into the farm and kills some of the sheep, his mother included. Chirin doesn't understand why his mother had to die, or what they did to deserve this. Consumed by a lust for revenge, he leaves the farm and goes after the wolf. But he's too weak to take on the wolf on his own, so he takes another option: become the wolf's apprentice so he can learn how to be a wolf just like him so he can kill him in the future. Needless to say, the path to become a wolf is a merciless, cruel one.If someone had watched this without any knowledge of anime, I wouldn't blame them at all for not knowing that this movie was animated in Japan, because this movie has a very Western cartoony look about it. Chirin's face when he's a lamb almost looks humanoid, kind of like something you'd find in an old Hanna-Barbera cartoon, and none of the animals have the kinds of overly round designs you'd find in most anime nowadays. But even by seventies standards, this movie is surprisingly well animated. There are still frames here and there, but movement is smooth when needed, and the movie has very good in-between animation, especially when the wolf appears on screen. Lip flaps are fully animated, the backgrounds are seamlessly integrated with the character animation, and the only real shortcuts on display are used to allude to but not completely show graphic violence. This could have easily been one of those Hanna-Barbera esque movies that had no budget, but it's clear the animators put a lot of effort into this...and want to know the most jarring thing? The company that animated this was Sanrio. Yes, Sanrio, the people who made the cutesy-wootsy Hello Kitty and Aggretsuko, a show that's part slice of life funny animal comedy and part existential horror based on working life. My mind was blown when I first found out that Sanrio worked on movies like this back in the day. It helps that the movie has a great sense of tone and atmosphere. It manages to keep a balanced tone throughout the movie, with the cutesy parts staying in the first 15 minutes, while the rest of the movie is fairly dark and grounded, but still having some subtle comedic moments peppered throughout. The movie still manages to keep said comedic moments subdued enough to not completely feel jarring. (Take note, Demon Slayer!)The music isn't much to write home about. On one hand, I absolutely love the theme songs and insert songs, all of which are sung by the same singer, who unfortunately weren't credited (I know the English version is sung by The Brothers' Four, but there is literally no info on the internet about the person who sang the Japanese version and all the other songs). That said, the movie is heavy on the orchestrated pieces and trumpets typical of Western animation during that time period, along with a few electronic numbers mixed in. It's very easy to tell that this movie was made in the seventies, and the soundtrack is full on seventies here. Now, the English dub of this movie is more well known to people who have seen it, and while some voices are genuinely well cast, the acting can get rather hammy at times, detrimenting scenes that benefitted from being more subtle in the Japanese version. There's also added dialogue and sound effects, probably done in an effort to make sure kids don't get bored and get rid of completely silent moments. Granted, they at least don't try to shoehorn in dumb jokes like Saban does, and the soundtrack is kept the same, though the songs are dubbed and are rather...off-key. Though I do have to question why the Japanese version calls him Woe when the English dub's name for him, Wolf, sounds much better. I do wish someone would release the soundtrack for this movie, because I love all the songs on it!But let me tell you exactly what makes this movie so great: To quote another one of my favorite anime bloggers, this is a movie dedicated entirely to character development. It's a character study first and foremost, showing Chirin changing significantly over the course of the movie because of his circumstances, both those that are beyond his control to the ones born from his own choices. Every action advances not only the plot, but Chirin's own development, and sometimes, character development isn't always positive. Some may question the fact that after a few years with Wolf, Chirin refers to him as his father, but one, I always assumed it was a sort of self-induced Stockholm Syndrome considering Chirin sought him out willingly, and two, in taking Chirin under his paw, Wolf kind of does become the only sort of parental figure Chirin has, considering he not only took him in but also taught him how to hunt for food and stuff. It's a gray area, and it helps that Wolf, while depicted as genuinely menacing and threatening, isn't shown as inherently evil. He just hunts for food like any other wolf does, and after injuring a bear, he lets the bear escape. This kind of subtle characterization is paramount in making sure he isn't shown as completely evil, and I think the movie does a great job on that one.For anyone wondering, this movie doesn't end happily ever after, and I think it's all the better for it, because without spoiling anything, ending it any other way might have been a cop-out. But I think what makes this movie even better is its history. Ringing Bell is based on a children's book by one Takashi Yanase, who many may know created the Anpanman franchise. The book that the movie is based on was actually based on Yanase's experiences surviving World War II, as the only reason he became a children's book writer and illustrator is so he could cope with his PTSD. On its own, Ringing Bell is a cautionary tale about revenge and how pursuing it can leave you feeling empty and giving you nothing, but based on the history of its author and the book, it can also be interpreted as an allegory on the effects of war, such as Wolf representing war, Chirin's mother representing innocent civilians killed during it, and Chirin representing children or war orphans who lost friends and family members. With that information in mind, both the book and the movie can be seen as an anti-war work, even though the movie itself is about a sheep and a wolf, thus making it Yanase's most personal work to date. As you can no doubt tell, I absolutely love media with a rich, varied history like this, and I respect it and the people who work on it for not only daring to push the boundaries that are put on kids' movies, but for refusing to dumb themselves down for their audience and strive to tell the stories they want to tell no matter what. I only wish more of those could be made nowadays, though thankfully, the idea that animation is just for children is starting to die out bit by bit, so who knows?Should you decide you want to watch this movie in a legal fashion, you're in luck! In 2013, the wonderful people at Discotek Media announced they licensed it, and a year later, they released it on DVD, with both the English and Japanese tracks intact. But if you don't want to fill your shelves with a physical copy, it's also available to stream on Amazon Prime for a fee, and for free on the new website RetroCrush. After being out of print for decades, it's back in circulation, and deservedly so, in my humble opinion, as it's one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, just behind Dog of Flanders. Ringing Bell isn't for the faint of heart, but it's still an absolutely wonderful, haunting movie that will stay with you forever, and I highly recommend it! seen. It's full of mature life lessons most kids movies today refuse to even touch upon, and I'm sure something like this would be reviled at today. But I actually love it for its maturity and refusal to dumb itself down for its audience.The story is very simple. A young lamb named Chirin loves playing in the farm and being with his mother, even though he doesn't always listen to her. But one day, a wolf breaks into the farm and kills some of the sheep, his mother included. Chirin doesn't understand why his mother had to die, or what they did to deserve this. Consumed by a lust for revenge, he leaves the farm and goes after the wolf. But he's too weak to take on the wolf on his own, so he takes another option: become the wolf's apprentice so he can learn how to be a wolf just like him so he can kill him in the future. Needless to say, the path to become a wolf is a merciless, cruel one.If someone had watched this without any knowledge of anime, I wouldn't blame them at all for not knowing that this movie was animated in Japan, because this movie has a very Western cartoony look about it. Chirin's face when he's a lamb almost looks humanoid, kind of like something you'd find in an old Hanna-Barbera cartoon, and none of the animals have the kinds of overly round designs you'd find in most anime nowadays. But even by seventies standards, this movie is surprisingly well animated. There are still frames here and there, but movement is smooth when needed, and the movie has very good in-between animation, especially when the wolf appears on screen. Lip flaps are fully animated, the backgrounds are seamlessly integrated with the character animation, and the only real shortcuts on display are used to allude to but not completely show graphic violence. This could have easily been one of those Hanna-Barbera esque movies that had no budget, but it's clear the animators put a lot of effort into this...and want to know the most jarring thing? The company that animated this was Sanrio. Yes, Sanrio, the people who made the cutesy-wootsy Hello Kitty and Aggretsuko, a show that's part slice of life funny animal comedy and part existential horror based on working life. My mind was blown when I first found out that Sanrio worked on movies like this back in the day. It helps that the movie has a great sense of tone and atmosphere. It manages to keep a balanced tone throughout the movie, with the cutesy parts staying in the first 15 minutes, while the rest of the movie is fairly dark and grounded, but still having some subtle comedic moments peppered throughout. The movie still manages to keep said comedic moments subdued enough to not completely feel jarring. (Take note, Demon Slayer!)The music isn't much to write home about. On one hand, I absolutely love the theme songs and insert songs, all of which are sung by the same singer, who unfortunately weren't credited (I know the English version is sung by The Brothers' Four, but there is literally no info on the internet about the person who sang the Japanese version and all the other songs). That said, the movie is heavy on the orchestrated pieces and trumpets typical of Western animation during that time period, along with a few electronic numbers mixed in. It's very easy to tell that this movie was made in the seventies, and the soundtrack is full on seventies here. Now, the English dub of this movie is more well known to people who have seen it, and while some voices are genuinely well cast, the acting can get rather hammy at times, detrimenting scenes that benefitted from being more subtle in the Japanese version. There's also added dialogue and sound effects, probably done in an effort to make sure kids don't get bored and get rid of completely silent moments.

It reminds me alot of Bambi for some reason... accept Bambi doesn't go around killing people after his mom dies.Story:A young lamb's mother is killed by a wolf. The Lamb leaves determined to become stronger and ends up becoming an apprentice of the very wolf who killed his mother in the first place. You see the transformation of the innocent child become a disturbed killer. The moral of the story is actual very deep for something that should be viewed as a child's movie.Overall this anime hasn't claimed a spot in the hall of...Origenal movies~ But it was ok.A bit depressing though despite being about baby lambsXD Origenal movies~ But it was ok.A bit depressing though despite being about baby lambsXD"", 'Death is inevitable.  Even if you can control of your fate, you pay a price by doing so.  In the end, death still comes and your life will be forgotten.Let me back up for a moment.  Did I mention this is a childrens\' movie?  The plot of this short movie follows Chirin, an innocent lamb whose mother is killed by a wolf.  Vowing to never be weak again, Chirin trains to become a wolf and exact revenge on his mother\'s killer.  Ringing Bell is likely the darkest children\'s film ever made, but is well worth watching.The plot of Ringing...Bell is really where the value of this film lies.  Though the plot is very grim, it is intelligent and mature.  From the halfway point of the film to its end, the movie poses a series of difficult questions and doesn\'t really give complete answers.  The viewer is left to watch the story unfold and draw meaning for themselves.As for the other aspects of this movie, I should warn that I was only able to find the English dub.  This dub however is surprisingly good.  In particular, the narrator, Ron Gans, has a great voice and does an excellent job.  The handful of songs (also in English) in this movie are rather annoying and are reminiscent of the songs from the old animated Hobbit movie.  The character design and animation is nothing spectacular, but my perception might be skewed as a 2013 viewer assessing a film from 1978.I first heard of this film on the Anime World Order podcast, where they remarked that the message of Ringing Bell was ""If you are born a sheep, then be a sheep; don\'t try to be something you\'re not"".  This is a perfectly fine interpretation, but I believe that the message of the movie is about the consequences of how you live your life.  Living a life among the weak is easy, comfortable, and happy, but as a consequence, you are susceptible to violence and despair from the actions of the strong.  You can try to be strong, but to do this you must discard the comforts of a simple life and live a hellish existence. If you are successful, you can reap the benefits of being strong, but someone stronger will inevitably come along to knock you down.  Either way, your life will be forgotten eventually, so make a decision about the direction of your life based on what you want and accept the consequences of your choice.My biggest concern about this film is that the message it relays may not be something that its intended audience, children, are ready to receive.  Even with ""adult"" themes, it is definitely aimed at children, who may even be scarred by having such a brutal message about the world forced on them.  I suppose it does however, provide a contrast to the overwhelming amount of mindless childrens\' entertainment which is produced today.Even for adults, the movie is worth a quick, 45 minute look.  At the very least it serves as an unique entry for film/anime history.

That being said the film knows what it is and executes the story excellently.Story: 10The story of this movie is unique and bitterly tragic. The sadness of the tale hit me like a gut-punch. Its ability to move the viewer and stir emotion is what really makes this movie's story special. The surprising story developments amplify the emotion packed into this film. It is a powerful combination and will have the viewer ruminating on the story well after the credits roll. Themes of the...story include: The cruelty of nature, loss of innocence, vengeance, survival, loneliness, despair, regret and fighting against destiny/in-born nature. What hit me most of all though was the concept that sometimes getting what you think you wanted can be the most cruel and terrible outcome. Truly a powerful tale.Art: 10The art shifts with the tone of the story masterfully. Everything from scenery, character design, and colors adapts with the story. This really adds to the emotion and feelings behind the scenes. It is amazing to see art direction that accommodates the story so naturally at every scene. In addition the art style is interesting and the animation is very clean when you consider the age of this film.Sound: 10Just like the art the music fits and boosts the emotion of the story. The music comes in where it belongs, but also knows when to let up and let silence fall. The faint ringing of the bell has great meaning in context of the story and this also hits home. I watched in English dub and the lyrical pieces of the soundtrack were done very well. The voice actors delivered their lines with emotion and purpose. The narration work was also done with sincerity and was quite impactful.Character: 10The main characters of the story are complicated and 3-dimensional. The relationship between the two main characters is equally intriguing and complex as the individuals themselves. They have very interesting motivations, thoughts, and feelings. They are fallible and feel pain. Despite being animals they are very much so human. They carry the burdens of the human heart within them. You can relate to these characters and they will speak to your humanity. They are remarkably memorable and well written. The amount of character development packed into this movie is also amazing. Watching how Chirin changed was shocking, but also brutally real. If you love character development it is a real treat.Enjoyment: 10Though the film made me sad I also really enjoyed it. It sent me on an emotional roller coaster. It had me invested and moved. It gave me an experience I will not forget and really made me think. I know I will watch this again in the future to experience the powerful emotions it brought out in me. story include: The cruelty of nature, loss of innocence, vengeance, survival, loneliness, despair, regret and fighting against destiny/in-born nature.

I watched this on the recommendation of Justin Sevakis\'s \'Buried Treasures\' column, using the dub which is the only version I could find online as a torrent. The dub is a little overwrought and the music inappropriate (although some reviewers think the over-cutesiness of the sound effects & young-Chirin\'s voice actor makes the contrast all the more striking), and I suspect the Japanese version is more preferable. The animation is low-resolution...and dated since Sanrio/Madhouse could not compete with _Bambi_ in terms of animation extravagance, but still watchable due to the attention lavished on movement, especially as the colors and landscape transition to match the thematic changes.It starts off _Bambi_-style, with our bubbly lamb protagonist bouncing around the meadow encountering all his animal friends and mother, who warns him to never leave the farm lest the Wolf on the mountain devour him. As one can guess, she will be the first to die. Chirin is a good kid and never does leave the farm (the opposite of what one might guess). One dark and stormy night, the Wolf descends, and the Wolf bursts into the fold, defeating the guard dogs, and enters the barn, a wolf among sheep, who can only cower in terror, because as always, \'the strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must\'. Chirin\'s mother throws herself on the half-asleep lamb to save him from the Wolf, who kills her. Shattered by grief, he rages. What reason was there for his mother to die? None. What can he do about it? Nothing. What response can the others offer? Silence. If that is how the world is, then better to be a wolf than a lamb! He follows the Wolf, swearing revenge, but unable to affect the Wolf, who brushes him away with his tail. Chirin continues to follow the Wolf around but is hardpressed to keep up, and realizes the gap between him and the Wolf. The Wolf refuses to train Chirin to be a wolf.While ineptly hunting one day, he sees a snake attacking a mother bird guarding her nest, and lunges in to hunt (but really protect) the snake, and while succeeding in driving off the snake by biting it, the bird is dead and all her eggs shatter. This second blow also shatters Chirin. I am reminded of the Talmudic story of the Other One, the great Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah, who one day witnesses a boy steal a bird\'s eggs but also kill her without any punishment as promised by Deuteronomy, and witnesses a second boy spare the mother bird but immediately fall and break his neck without receiving the specific reward promised by Deuteronomy; and became a heretic devoted to breaking every law of God - which may sound extreme, but how much evil is required to pose the Problem of Evil? The Wolf preaches to Chirin: all living things live at the expense of other living beings; there is only strength and survival and whether one will choose them or not. There is no god, no celestial judges, no karma, no rights to survival, no law and no nature but red in tooth and claw; the race is not to the swift nor the contest to the strong but time and chance happeneth to them all; one man launches his tech startup and goes bankrupt, another launches it six months later and becomes a billionaire; one man gets a lucky set of genes with 10 extra good variants and lives a happy life while another gets 10 extra bad ones and rots in jail; no amount of exercise can guarantee one will not die of a heart attack, and many contract lung cancer who have never smoked a single cigarette; there are only atoms and the void in the desert of the real. Chirin is converted.Chirin becomes the Wolf\'s pupil, practicing tree-shattering headbutting and combat, and - montage - grows into a gruff billy goat with the eyes of a killer. This world is hell, the Wolf says, and Chirin replies that he now thinks of the Wolf as his father and will live in that hell. The final lesson: an attack on the original farm on a dark night. Chirin defeats the guard dogs easily and bursts into the barn, where the sheep cower before him, and prepares to kill - but stops helplessly as another lamb is sheltered by its mother. The transformation into a wolf is incomplete. The Wolf naturally tries to finish the job, but Chirin is forced to fight him and, the student having become the master, kills him. His revenge, such as it is, has been gained, and the Wolf dies content: the weak must yield to the strong. Chirin tries to be re-accepted among the sheep, but he is too different and they cannot imagine he was ever once like them, and he returns to the mountain, never again to be seen by the sheep. There, alone, among the rocks where they sparred, he mourns his father. Not truly a wolf, nor yet a sheep, but, he tells his father\'s memory - he still survives! And in the mountains, the Buddhist bell sounds, reminding men of the impermanence of the world (""Chirin, I hear the sound of your bell, and it reminds me of quiet crying, the sound of all the world’s sorrow"").There are not many anime from the 1970s which could be said to be as worth watching now as the day they were made, but _Chirin no Suzu_ manages to be one of them for its unflinching honesty. The plot is surprising and the ending gripping, reminding me of _The End of Evangelion_ in its similar starkness, honesty, refusal to take a cheap easy way out, and sense of despair yet determination. Like Shinji, Chirin has taken a path far from the common herd and cannot return to how things were, and his relatives are dead at his own hands; yet - he still exists. and dated since Sanrio/Madhouse could not compete with _Bambi_ in terms of animation extravagance, but still watchable due to the attention lavished on movement, especially as the colors and landscape transition to match the thematic changes.It starts off _Bambi_-style, with our bubbly lamb protagonist bouncing around the meadow encountering all his animal friends and mother, who warns him to never leave the farm lest the Wolf on the mountain devour him.

Notable for its subversion of the sugary, saccharine nature of modern children's stories, the film refuses to pander to children's base expectations or delicate sensibilities, instead encouraging them to think about the complex lessons and ideas that are illustrated within.The film's protagonist, Chirin, is a playful, curious lamb without a care in the world until his mother is taken from him by a vicious, bloodthirsty wolf named Woe. Rather than cower in fear at the prospect of being eaten, however, Chirin...chooses to strike out on his own and become that which is feared.

A small man but big guy here.As humans progressed through the ages the idea that resources such as the natural world should be preserved. While protected areas started showing up in the 1700s or early the first national parks started to appear in the late 1800s with the first of these being Yellowstone National Park (1872). Over time these efforts have expanded, moving away from national protections to more local protections. As our cities grow the need for developed land comes at the cost of these natural areas.

Chirin no Suzu (Ringing Bell) is the anime that shocked me the most. Mostly because I never expected to see everything that happened. Takashi Yanase wrote the book on which this anime is based. One of the reasons he became a children’s writer and illustrator is how he could deal with his PTSD because he survived World War II....Although it doesn\'t seem like anti-war anime to anyone at first, when you metaphorically look at anime, you realize it has to do with it. The plot revolves around a newborn lamb Chirin who lives a peaceful life on a meadow with his mother. This will soon come to an end when they are attacked by a wolf named Woe who kills Chirin\'s mother. Broken by his mother\'s death, Chirin swears that he himself will become a wolf to avenge his mother, unaware of how much this transformation will cost him. This story certainly reminds you a lot of Bambie, which reminded me at first. But the thing is, this isn\'t Bambie. This is ""Bambie gone bad""! I thought that Chirin would become a wolf with the help of some magic, and take revenge on the wolf who killed his mother. This is what I expected the most because this anime movie was done by Sanrio. For those of you who don’t know what Sanrio is, it’s a company that has created famous characters like Hello Kitty, My Melody, Kuromi, Cinnamoroll, Little Twin Stars, Pompompurin and many others. So I definitely didn’t expect such an anime from Sanrio. Let me get back to the story. Chirin will do anything to become like a wolf. Because in order to take revenge on him, he needs to become like him. I thought this was going to be an anime about his physical becoming like a wolf, but it’s actually about his mental becoming. His mind will change so much, that he will even be willing to kill someone of his kind if necessary. This anime is definitely scary because it has some disturbing scenes. In my opinion, the worst was one scene when Chirin saw one animal attack another animal which was then killed. And as Chirin came to defend the other animals from that other one, he accidentally kills them himself. It’s a very dark anime where Chirin’s psyche changes over time as he begins to wonder what the meaning of life is if you can easily be killed. He decided to change his destiny by becoming like a wolf.I gave this anime 10/10 for several reasons. This is an overpowering anime that really managed to portray the story in a dark but real way. You feel it emotionally because rarely can an anime portray and evoke emotions as well as this one. It is completely dedicated to character development. The last thing that made the anime great for me was because it was instructive. This anime clearly shows that you are what you choose to be. Because your choices affect you and how you develop. Chirin will be so focused on revenge that not only will he lose everything and everyone, but he will lose himself the most.This is a movie that lasts 46 minutes. He has managed to show so much in such a short time. It kept my attention from beginning to end and I couldn’t possibly predict the things that happened. I understand that this anime is not for everyone, but whoever dares to watch it, I hope they will like it._____________________________________________________________________Hrvatski jezik: Za početak ću reći da ću morati navesti par spojlera jer bi nekima ovaj anime mogao biti uznemirujuć. Chirin no Suzu (Ringing Bell) je anime koji me najviše šokirao. Najviše zato što nisam nikako očekivala da ću vidjeti sve ono što se dogodilo. Takashi Yanase je napisao knjigu po kojoj se temelji ovaj anime. Jedan od razloga zašto je postao dječji pisac i ilustrator je kako bi se mogao nositi sa svojim PTSP-om jer je preživio Drugi svjetski rat. Iako nikome na prvu ne izgleda kao antiratni anime, kada metaforički sagledaš anime, shvatiš da ima veze s tim. Radnja se vrti oko novorođenog janjeta Chirina koji živi mirnim životom na livadi sa svojom majkom. Tome će ubrzo doći kraj kad ih napadne vuk po imenu Woe koji ubija Chirinovu majku. Slomljen majčinom smrću, Chirin se zaklinje da će i sam postati vuk kako bi se osvetio majci, nesvjestan koliko će ga koštati ova preobrazba. Ova priča vas sigurno dosta podsjeća na Bambie, što je i mene na prvu podsjetilo. Ali stvar je u tome što ovo nije Bambie. Ovo je ""Bambie gone bad""! Mislila sam da će Chirin s pomoću neke magije postati vuk, i osvetiti se vuku koji je ubio njegovu majku. To sam najviše očekivala jer je ovaj anime film radio Sanrio. Za vas koji ne znate što je Sanrio, to je kompanija koja je stvorila poznate likove kao što su Hello Kitty, My Melody, Kuromi, Cinnamoroll, Little Twin Stars, Pompompurin i mnogi drugi. Tako da definitivno nisam očekivala takav anime od Sanria. Da se vratim na priču. Chirin će uraditi sve kako bi postao kao vuk. Jer da bi mu se osvetio, on treba postati poput njega. Mislila sam da će to biti anime o njegovom fizičkom postajanju kao vuk, ali je zapravo o psihičkom. Njegov će se um toliko izmijeniti, da će biti spreman čak i da ubije nekog od svoje vrste ako je to potrebno. Ovaj anime je definitivno zastrašujuć jer ima neke uznemirujuće scene. Po meni je najgora bila jedna scena kada je Chirin vidio da jedna životinja napada drugu životinju koja tada bude ubijena. I kako je Chirin došao da obrani ostale životinje od te druge, slučajno ih on sam ubija. Jako je mračan anime gdje se Chirinu psiha s vremenom mijenja kada se počeo pitati koji je smisao života ako te lako mogu ubiti. On je odlučio promijeniti svoju sudbinu tako što će postati kao vuk.Ovome animeu sam dala 10/10 zbog više razloga. Premoćan je anime koji je stvarno uspio prikazati priču na mračan ali stvaran način. Emocionalno ga osjetiš jer rijetko koji anime može tako dobro prikazati i izazvati emocije kao ovaj. U potpunosti je posvećen razvoju lika. Zadnje zbog čega mi je bio odličan je zato što je poučan. Ovaj anime jasno prikazuje da si ono što odabereš da budeš. Jer vaši izbori utječu na vas i kako se razvijate. Chirin će toliko biti fokusiran na osvetu da ne samo da će izgubiti sve i ostale, već će najviše izgubiti sebe.Ovo je film koji traje 46 minuta. Toliko je toga uspio prikazati u tako malo vremena. Meni je držao pažnju od početka do kraja i nisam nikako mogla predvidjeti stvari koje su se dogodile. Razumijem da ovaj anime nije za svakoga, ali tko god se usudi da ga pogleda, nadam se da će mu se svidjeti.

Most of the film felt just like buildup to our ending(a very horrifying, deep ending) but I didn\'t feel engaged in the film because of how saccharine it was for quite a bit.Woe and Chirin have a most interesting dynamic, the art is pretty nice in its Disneyfied pastoral way, and the music is also nice, I guess it might traumatize some younger kids, the plot is not very original, the characters are kind of flat until the end.I like that it didn\'t go the way of ""predator animals are evil! We defeat them and live happily after!"" but...instead it teaches that predator animals simply do their best to survive in a cruel world.I can\'t say much about the movie other than that. instead it teaches that predator animals simply do their best to survive in a cruel world.I can\'t say much about the movie other than that.', 'Stop me if you\'ve heard this children\'s tale before. Once upon a time, there was a little lamb who lived on a farm with his mother and the rest of their flock. One night, a wolf raids the farm and kills mother sheep. Devastated by the loss, the lamb... decides he needs to become a wolf in order to wreak vengeance.Well! With a synopsis like that, all I can say is: thank God the farmer didn\'t get to mother sheep first, otherwise this anime could have been even more fucked up!Needless to say, it was this strangely dark premise which attracted me to ""Ringing Bell""...a few years back. Having finally got around to watching it though, I have to say I\'m a little disappointed. Turns out that the synopsis pretty much accounts for everything that makes this show interesting. Beyond that, the story pans out more or less as expected, and the further plot twists I was half expecting never really turned up.Execution wise, ""Ringing Bell"" was okay at best. Being an old show, its production and storytelling techniques feel somewhat crude, but not to the point of being hilariously bad. The music, while not unpleasant on the ears, lacks subtlety - if a scene is meant to be happy/sad, you can be sure the music will be shouting that emotion into your ears.The art is undeniably dated, but still watchable. During the lighter portions of ""Ringing Bell"", it had no problem conveying the cuteness and playfulness befitting a children\'s anime. However these same elements do not play nicely with the anime\'s darker side, and I am left with an impression of an anime comprising two halves that don\'t gel.Still, the concept was interesting, and while realising it the movie did rustle up some powerful moments. Just don\'t expect too much - it is for children after all, and doesn\'t do much beyond that.Personal rating: +0.5 (decent) a few years back.

I was simply trying to watch any vintage anime titles before 1980, specifically anything that resembled Toei\'s ""The Boy Sarutobi Sasuke"" or ""Journey to the West."" Eventually, I stumbled onto Ringing Bell, read its description and immediately hit play. I found its story simple but very compelling and relatable. Also, I was taken back at how it depicts life, and revenge through animals. I loved how the film goes from being a cheery family friendly animate feature then mixes in radical shonen art styles and storytelling. Chirin\'s design for when he finally become an adult and...vicious fighter is simply amazing; as an Aries it vibes with me way too much.Ultimately, I do not think I have a preference as to how the film should be watched, both its subbed and dub options are great. I have shown this short to others in either formats, and it is naturally draws in viewers. I think it catches people off guard with its animation style and story which has allowed it to become a cult classic. I recommend people seeing this at least once in their lives. vicious fighter is simply amazing; as an Aries it vibes with me way too much.Ultimately, I do not think I have a preference as to how the film should be watched, both its subbed and dub options are great.

The second part is when...the big bad wolf attacks, and Chirin steels up the determination to become the wolf\'s apprentice, no matter the consequences.  And the third act...well, those consequences.Despite its present-day Hello Kitty and Friends reputation, the earlier years of Sanrio were peppered with little not-so-Disney stories.

One stormy night, the Wolf King comes to the barn where the herd stays and kills Chirin's mother. The distraught Chirin decides that he must get revenge on the Wolf King.

Teach me to be like you!"" So, first of all: Relatable.I wasn\'t expecting too much from this other than being a vehicle for a Sanrio character, so it was definitely a surprise. It\'s a grim story that doesn\'t offer a lot of definitive answers to the questions it raises. I can\'t say I agree with the message I felt was supposed to be taken away from it, though.The problem it presents is that Chirin struggled to process his mother\'s death and he resolved to do whatever it took to get revenge. Because he was born weak, there was nothing he could...do to change his situation or help others unless he adopted the methods of his cold-hearted enemy. I was with it that far. From that point on, going into the final act, it\'s clear that achieving this form of power has corrupted Chirin and made him an outcast permanently. So I feel like this was saying that seeking the power to destroy takes away your opportunity to defend others, and that\'s what I disagree with.When Chirin fought off the snake, but could not save the bird or the eggs, we saw someone who was willing to put his life on the line to violently resist oppression. But he was not strong or practiced enough. He failed and was devastated. There was no reason to assume that following in the wolf\'s footsteps would have REQUIRED him to close his heart to others. But that\'s the railroad the story goes down and Chirin scares the sheep such that he cannot join them. This is anti-violence propaganda, suitable only as a children\'s story if you want children to grow up believing the best people are those who turn away from taking the power to protect others from ""bad"" places. Y\'know, like the Star Wars prequels. It\'s a nonsense moral, especially when the supposed ""good guys"" in real life are hyper-violent imperialists bent on building the weapons of mass destruction required to achieve world domination. That is to say, not the fucking good guys. They just smile a lot and frown at riots and violent protests from the actual good guys who oppose the state-sanctioned violence.But, whatever. It doesn\'t align with me there. It definitely agrees with me artistically, though. The character designs in this are top shelf. Chirin\'s child form is perfectly malleable to whatever exaggerated movement they want to give it while maintaining its adorable qualities. And yet it still fits perfectly alongside (contrasting against, of course) the wolf\'s grizzled and shadowy profile. And the natural movements they achieved for the wolf were amazing. This is superb anime and a startlingly good realization of the story they wanted to tell. do to change his situation or help others unless he adopted the methods of his cold-hearted enemy.

And yet it still fits perfectly alongside (contrasting against, of course) the wolf\'s grizzled and shadowy profile. And the natural movements they achieved for the wolf were amazing. This is superb anime and a startlingly good realization of the story they wanted to tell.', ""Ringing Bell is a hidden gem that deserves more attention.The story is simple as one would expect for a cartoon aimed at a younger audience but it is nice and tightly tied together and has great visuals that help elevate it to something special with its fantastic character designs. Art style is very old school in a charming way. The characters have interesting motivations that one might not expect which makes it feel dynamic and less like treading through a well-worn path.All in all, it feels like a nicely fleshed out Aesop's Fable. It's well crafted in its simplicity and can be enjoyed by all...ages although some of the scenes may be a bit scary for younger viewers. ages although some of the scenes may be a bit scary for younger viewers.""]"
D.C.if: Da Capo if,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5216/DCif__Da_Capo_if,"[""Time and time again a “used to be popular” franchise releases an OVA, in order to revive itself and Da Capo: If just felt like another attempt to do so.Da Capo: If is a Harem, Romantic, Comedy, Drama(?) that follows the same old story as its previous incarnations, not sure where it fits into the timeline though. Junichi is a guy who has somehow attracted a large female following. Although this time round the magical aspect is played down and Kotori fans are offered some fanservice, since the all important “what if he ends up with Kotori?” question is answered. Like most of the people...who preferred Kotori, amongst the Da Capo girls, I was expecting great things from this short OVA. Yet it comes to no surprise that this turned out to be quite the disappointment. Yet what really surprised me was that the whole thing felt like it was too long and that became its major downfall. The story literally begins with Kotori about to get married and we’re supposed to flashback to see how it came to pass. But sadly the writers decided to pad the story with clichés, you will see coming a mile off and pointless character interactions.The characters are the same as ever however after sitting through 4 series; seeing the same old faces, with their rather annoying quirks (banana girl) can be more tiresome than paying attention to a dull Math's lecture. So whatever characters you liked in the previous Da Capo series, you will like here and whatever character didn't like... just don't expect shift in your own opinion.Sadly this is the same case with the animation and soundtrack, as they have both remained unchanged. Not to forget that this is from the style of the Da Capo series & not the Da Capo II series, so everything just looks & sounds older than it should be. At least the die-hard fans of the Da Capo series will get a sense of nostalgia after hearing the 2 insert songs used.Overall Da Capo If did give an answer to a question that I’ve had on my mind since starting the series… was it a good answer? You tell me. All I know was that it was dragged on with the most trivial issue imaginable; making the drama it was supposed to have, quite laughable. At least the romance was rather refreshing and having a story focusing on Junichi & Kotori was a great idea however one thing I would like to know… what on earth happened to Nemu? who preferred Kotori, amongst the Da Capo girls, I was expecting great things from this short OVA.

This is PURE FAN SERVICE for those that wanted Kotori and Junichi to be together.  It is a separate world from that of Da Capo, a spin off.  It has NO relation to the actual TV series.  It's just for those that like Kotori and wanted her to have the happy ending and not Nemu.That's it :) "", ""What wold have happened if Nemu never returned and Junichi went with Kotori? Shirakawa-lovers rejoice! Or should you?This is a 2 episode OVA that plays with the alternate path where Shirakawa wins, much like the KGNE OVA where Haruka wins. Sadly, this attempt falls short of where I had hoped for it to be. Yes you have your original Da Capo cast and yes the music and scenery all looks familiar, but the awesome, gripping story of Da Capo is all but missing.Animation:The animation style is the same as the original animation and the quality is fairly good. There are one or two places where...I noticed an inconsistency in the drawing but otherwise it was fairly well done. The colors/scenery fit the mood quite well and, well, Kotori is Kotori.Sound:An interesting OP and ED (in episode 1)... the OP is new but reminiscent of other Da Capo OPs and the ED is not much. BGM is traditional Da Capo love it or hate it style. VA cast is the same as the original so you get your Yui Horie.Story:The jumping off point in this show is somewhere in the middle of DC SS, so you should probably watch up through DC SS for much of this to make sense.The story starts off with the ending of the OVA before jumping back in time (I wasn't sure at first which was quite confusing) and working forwards again.It's known from the start that Kotori is getting her man, but in traditional Da Capo style they throw in a little drama. Sadly, the attempt at drama was a bit nonsensical and the characters' reactions over the top. Think of KGNE Next Season's plot twist but over a much more meaningless reason.The resolution to the conflict is likewise pitifully made up, and it seemed like they just wanted to find a way for Yui Horie to sing a song. In any case, this part was the real downer in this short OVA.Character:The characters are well defined/developed in the original show by this point so there isn't too much to be expected here. It's really difficult to separate characters/story, especially if the character's development is pretty much the story... But leaving that in the story section, the overall characters were (other than the horrible story) true to their original nature.Value:There are some cute scenes and moments worthy of the Da Capo name, but the rest of it fell short, leaving much to be desired.

Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40530/Jaku-Chara_Tomozaki-kun,"[""I want to iterate this before all else being it’s important: This is not nearly as gimmicky as the synopsis puts it. Not only is it arguably one of the most fascinating and culturally relevant anime that has aired in the last decade or so, but it’s a show that contains genuine character exploration and growth.I can’t blame you for thinking that sounds impossible based on the surface level display this show gives off. Though it’s simplistic and very much adapted from a light novel, it’s fully aware of both its audience and the landscape of anime similar to it. It demonstrably stresses the...importance of self-improvement, but primarily it's biting against irrational subconscious anti-social mindsets that cause people anguish.Fittingly to this narrative, Jaku-chara Tomozaki-kun opens with a scene that can easily be interpreted as generic and a meaningless interpretation of a gamer, but in actuality is one half of communicating the entire message of the show. Tomozaki is ranked 1 in TackFam, the universe’s depiction of a popular fighting game. Up against Nakumura, a regular classmate of his and someone far beneath his skill level, he easily destroys him. But Nakumura is arrogant, he blames the game, the characters. He resorts to blaming the matchups. Tomozaki proves it's a matter of skill, talent, and effort. He beats him even with the worst of matchups. A low level Marth player would still get destroyed by a top level Fox on FD, to put it into Smash Bros. terms, the game TackFam is based on. Tomozaki takes pride in his devotion to the game, and won’t accept baseless slander from someone who hasn’t put in the work he has. When we contrast this to the other half of the basis of the show: Tomozaki’s first interaction with Hinami, we become aware of what the major focal point actually is. When it comes to “real life”, Tomozaki is Nakumura in TackFam. He blames others for his own personal woes. (The ‘characters’) He believes there is a sort of social hierarchy he can’t break free from (The ‘game’), and that some people are just born better than others.(The ‘matchups’) It’s the exact same whiny and arrogant point of view he himself rebuked being directed towards TackFam. It’s blaming others when it's your own lack of effort that has you in the position you are. Why can’t it be any different when it comes to reality? Tomozaki is proven hypocritical.Make no mistake—this isn’t just about someone growing into a socially viable person, it's a show that’s directly criticizing the type of self-loathing and presumptuous belief that it’s others—not you— culture that anime itself tends to glorify and coddle those with a similar mindset. This was remarkable, and as a devout anime and light novel adaptation consumer, I was legitimately shocked that a show like this could exist in the climate of modern anime.Even though I was already sold after the first episode, the show continues forward with a main character who receives proper development, and a cast of side characters who are used to explore other plaguing mindsets. If it isn't already clear by now, this is more of a character driven drama rather than a rom-com with hyperbolic tropes of a gamer and normie popular kids.Tomozaki is directed down a path of social improvement by Hinami. This isn’t just basic advice, however. It's a decisive strategic motion to make friends and create interest in oneself. Easily said, the key to getting to know people is by showing interest in them or their surroundings. People won’t care about you if you don’t care about them. Yuzu likes Nakumura? Help her find ways to appeal to him. Mimimi wants to run for student council? Ask her if you can support her bid. Let people in, share secrets with them, gain their trust and become someone they can rely on. Fuuka likes a certain author? Read their books. When a time comes where you can ask her out to see a movie adaptation of the same author, you have both an excuse and are giving the other party respect by showing admiration to their interests. It’s physical improvements as well. Get a haircut. Stand up straight. Speak louder and stop looking so grim. Take care of your appearance and dress well. This show talks the talk and walks the walk.Of course, it can sound problematic to see interest in people as “goals” or for your own sake rather than by genuine curiosity and the desire to get to know someone, but the show has answers to this. Gradually throughout, Tomozaki gains his own agency. He realizes that being himself makes the other person more comfortable. Perhaps it was only through deliberate effort and a push from the back that Tomozaki was able to form relationships, but eventually he grows past the need to seek orders. He changes.The side characters are real people, not bloated tropes. Anime has a tendency to demonize “popular kids” and make them one dimensional bullies solely for the main characters to ultimately dunk on. I can assure you that with the exception of one single character in one scene, none of the characters in this show are like that at all. Yuzu, Mimimi, Takahiro, and Nakumura are vulnerable in some way. Deconstructing what commonly “popular characters” appear as in anime in a show like this seems even more important when it’s all about demonstrating the importance of having and maintaining relationships. As showing what would be the formidable unapproachable characters in other shows as real people, it’s encouraging and a reminder that we are not so different.Frequently I was struck at how overwhelmingly positive the show could get. Tomozaki would relish in and internalize his growth. He described the feelings of successful social interactions as “primal” like a necessary need. He grows if only a little bit each and every episode. It’s fun watching him gain the trust of others. It’s heartwarming seeing others take interest in him and care for him. He quickly becomes someone you can route for and support.It’s a rarity of a show. It manages to be mindfully indulgent, bold, and have meaning. And even if it's not as well-written as other more culturally influential anime, it’s accessibility and ease of entry may give someone what they really need. importance of self-improvement, but primarily it's biting against irrational subconscious anti-social mindsets that cause people anguish.Fittingly to this narrative, Jaku-chara Tomozaki-kun opens with a scene that can easily be interpreted as generic and a meaningless interpretation of a gamer, but in actuality is one half of communicating the entire message of the show.

Even with all of that this was probably one of the animes this season I really liked for some odd reasonThe animation is overall better than average with smooth and clear visuals. It can show all the otaku features that I can relate to, I can see my ugly face through the screen in essentially 4k resolution with amazing visuals.The characters are a textbook bland cast....The main two characters are Aoi Hinami and Fumiya Tomozaki.Aoi Hinami is a by the book tsundere and is very similar to Chizuru from Rent-a-Girl-Friend. She makes an effort to make our MC into a proper person and become more sociable. This doesn’t mean she is a bad character, she gives all the qualities one would want in a tsundere and makes the show a little bit more enjoyable.Our struggling reflection of ourselves is Fumiya Tomozaki, who is that classic outcast and otaku MC next to the window to the right of the classroom. He reluctantly listens to Aoi and creates an effort for a better him and slowly over time has major character developments.These characters if I’m being honest are two textbook characters that complement each other and create a very average cast of characters, much like the rest of the cast in the anime.The story as you probably interpreted is simply how long will it take Aoi to confess or something like that. In all seriousness, our story revolves around Aoi making Fumiya a better and more sociable person. I’m probably watching this because I am fervently waiting for our boy to be an absolute CHAD. Maybe it is the fact this story has been used so many times with so many takes that I have finally grown fond of it.The sounds are as you expect of an anime of this sort-average. The OP and ED are alright and have no positive or negative impact on the overall show. The soundtrack uses essentially basic sounds and there is nothing majorly notable.Ah, the enjoyment. I, for some reason, really looked forward to this show. The anime itself is executed well and created some laughs and cringe moments to enjoy. I might have a bad tendency to over-love shows that aren't special and aren't well known.

He might be boring to most people, but he sure does as hell own his mistakes and learn from it.In short, He brought the things that got him to the top of Tackfam -- which is ""If you fail, learn from it and improve."" mentality to the game called ""life"" Thinking to himself that no other game than Tackfam is worthy to play and spend your whole life improving upon.He then meets his lifelong gaming rival, that happens to be a girl, who\'s both a top gamer in Tackfam and in life.She tells him that she understands how he feels that Tackfam is the best game ever, but she also tells him that the game called ""life"" is also just as good.It\'s about a protagonist who has 0 life experience, no social skills, awkwardness, level 1 in the life game, etc. -- who tries his best to improve himself, goes out his comfort zone, does things that would make most people die of embarrassment.What I like about the protagonist is that he isn\'t a hateful loser, nor does he blame others for his shortcomings, nor does he play the victim card.

Many dropped it at first while those who remained slowly began to notice how their view changed, just like the characters did. It’s a Romcom that isn’t revolutionary but introduces concepts that makes it interesting and engaging to follow.It was certainly a show that exceeded my expectations.It’s a true character growth driven story of becoming a better person.On its surface it’s nothing mind-blowing and appears to be a standard Romcom about an unpopular guy who somehow meets the legend of the class and gets a harem that you\'ve seen countless times yet this assumption is very...misleading and Tomozaki, despite appearing as such, is not at all like that.All the girls introduced are not meant to be part of his harem and the show has wrongly been labeled as such. They are characters that get development themselves, as well as aiding the development of our MC while not coming off as too cliche or tropey. They really feel like people that you could meet in real life.While you may argue that the situation that our MC, the top player in Atafami finds himself in is very hard to relate to, you have to acknowledge the effort he puts in to change himself. I\'d say that the beginning doesn’t seem promising at all but the more we level up the greater it becomes. Everyone deserves a second chance if given the opportunity, right? Then even he should be able to fight to change himself for the better and we, as the audience should understand where he is coming from and not mock his efforts. Such a view is very misleading, and could lead to incorrect assumptions. No matter what, the fact still remains that in order to achieve something, even winning a mere game, you have to put your entire heart and soul into it - something I find admirable.It\'s a show that is neither a generic Romcom nor a harem. Its main appeal is the theme of self improvement through hard work and desire, something that would be praise worthy to many and becomes apparent in how our main hero grows as a character and as a human being.Growth doesn\'t happen overnight.It\'s a long process that requires a lot of time and soul put into it.This is the message the show tries to convey and we can see how the behaviour and self esteem of Tomozaki evolves the more he levels up and the audience that learns from his mistakes and the quests given by our main girl, Hinami Aoi.The quests that the main girl gives to MC may seem trivial but are actually helpful in the grand scheme of things. It\'s one of the main criticisms that the show has received - that it’s cringy, unrealistic and out of touch with reality which is clearly wrong. We should remember that Tomozaki is a loner that has troubles with social interaction therefore these trivial goals that she sets up for him are actually very meaningful despite being so small. The type of a goal doesn\'t matter, what truly matters is the effort you put in order to achieve said goal.The animation of this show is very minimalistic with no dynamic movement. At times it serves as a means to move from point A to point B. The majority of the content delivered is through the dialogue of characters. It\'s decent. While it\'s certainly not top tier, it\'s no doubt bearable to watch.There were few memorable OSTs that played during crucial scenes but often than not it was a sad piano to create the atmosphere or a very light hearted soundtrack to rekindle hope. Overall the music wasn\'t as memorable but not that bad. I\'d like to point out that even the lyrics of a song matter in this show so keep an eye on that.From a show that started with an interesting premise that at first became something to make fun of, Tomozaki changed for the better and so did the viewers who were watching his development unfold.It\'s a series that while not revolutionizing the genre made something unique and intriguing enough to follow by showcasing real character growth that rarely ever happens these days.If you wish to see a tale of a man who changed his life from the better, struggled but with effort and heart reached his goals, then I recommend watching ""Bottom-Tier Tomozaki"". misleading and Tomozaki, despite appearing as such, is not at all like that.All the girls introduced are not meant to be part of his harem and the show has wrongly been labeled as such. They are characters that get development themselves, as well as aiding the development of our MC while not coming off as too cliche or tropey. They really feel like people that you could meet in real life.While you may argue that the situation that our MC, the top player in Atafami finds himself in is very hard to relate to, you have to acknowledge the effort he puts in to change himself. I\'d say that the beginning doesn’t seem promising at all but the more we level up the greater it becomes. Everyone deserves a second chance if given the opportunity, right? Then even he should be able to fight to change himself for the better and we, as the audience should understand where he is coming from and not mock his efforts.

Week after week, episodes flew by in what seemed like a few minutes. The characters and premise of the show provided one of the more memorable experiences I’ve had with a slice of life in some time.For me, Tomozaki-Kun is what most people THINK Oregairu is. The concept of a socially inept loser going from a shut-in to normal high schooler is flawlessly executed here. Normally in these types of shows, the MC’s character development doesn’t feel organic or realistic. Either the MC...moves too fast, or too slow. Here we have a protagonist who takes gradual but sure steps out of his comfort zone in order to improve himself and make genuine connections with others. Week in and week out we see Tomozaki become more open to other people and learn more about how interpersonal relationships work. I love the analogous relationship of a video game character’s development to Tomozaki’s and think it offers a unique perspective on this type of show.Unfortunately, there were a great deal of people who wrote this show off after a couple weeks. Is the MC a loser who says and does cringe things at the start? Yes. That’s kind of the point of the series. What would be the point if a character already starts off as an alpha chad who has nothing else to learn or room to grow? If you can bear with the MC’s growing pains in the beginning, I think you’ll find Tomozaki-Kun to be a very enjoyable show.I’ve said all that and haven’t even touched on the girls in this show. As with most shows in this genre, Tomozaki’s development is caused and expedited by a girl at school, and there are several potential waifus who play major roles in the series. Unlike other anime in this genre, these are fully fleshed out and well written characters with their own unique quirks and personalities. The girls are not just there for fan service or shipping wars, but offer genuine value to this series and are one of the most enjoyable parts.All in all, Tomozaki-Kun was by far one of the top 2 or 3 most enjoyable shows this season. It’s one of only a few that I actually looked forward to on a weekly basis and now that the season is over, I can’t wait to get into the LNs. Tomozaki-Kun gets 10 tackfams out of 10. moves too fast, or too slow.

Tomozaki-Kun gets 10 tackfams out of 10.', 'Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is about your typical loner gamer dude who plays *not* Smash Bros at a very high level, and decides to one day meet up with the person right after him on the leaderboard, who ends up being a cute, popular girl from his class. After this meeting, this girl, Aoi, having scolded our protagonist, decides to help him out by teaching him how to become a riajuu, a “normie” you could say.I really wish I were be here right now saying good things about this show and how I used some of the advice Aoi gave to Tomozaki myself, but alas, here I...am, incredibly disappointed by what could have been a nice romcom with a school setting. The show presents an interesting idea, I haven’t actually seen anything like it before, but the execution of the premise set in place by the first few episodes is a complete miss.So, what is this premise? Tomozaki goes through several lessons with Aoi, who teaches him basic social skills, manners, posture, and so on, and gives him challenges such as “talk to three different girls” or “force a smile while wearing a mask”. Tomozaki doesn’t necessarily do well at completing these challenges, but he does try his earnest to do so, more often than not with the help of Aoi. Here is my first issue with show. If the whole premise is about the evolution of a loner into a riajuu, then why does Aoi do most of the work for him? It would be way more satisfying to watch Tomozaki do these challenges on his own, failing them or not, with all the cringy situations that these challenges may bring. I fail to understand why Aoi would be so invested into a random dude she met online. She’s not in love with him, and Tomozaki’s first impression on her was awful. Is it pity? Is it self-fulfillment? Who knows, but Aoi intervening as much as she does only reinforces all of the problems this show has.There’s an analogy Jaku-Chara brings up regarding real life and games, even though it’s slightly “cringy”. If real life is treated as a game, then the social skills and achievements can be the equivalent of the skills and achievements in a video game. Tomozaki being really good Tackfam comes with a contrast of him being really bad at real life. This brings up quite a disparity. If you’ve ever played a fighting game, you’d know how much effort it takes to be good, let alone a top level player in said game, even in a game like Smash Bros. It takes years and years of practice before you could consider yourself competent at a fighting game, practice that Tomozaki has clearly put into Tackfam out of his passion for the game. So why is it that he goes from being a complete loner to a good looking socially capable guy in the span of 4-5 episodes?! How come the show is 12 episodes long when Tomozaki achieves all but one of his goals in 5 episodes? Of course, the rest of the show feels like filler content that serves close to no purpose to the overall plotline. I will attribute this to poor pacing. I assume that the light novel goes way deeper into Tomozaki’s struggles and hardships, or at least I hope so.You might now ask me, “why am I comparing real life scenarios to fiction?” or “Why does it matter that Tomozaki achieved his goals quickly?”. The answer to that is simple, suspension of disbelief.I’ll let you google what suspension of disbelief means if you don’t know this term, but it’s a fancy way of referring to the reader or watcher believing and investing themselves into a given scenario. Here lies the main problem of Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun: I do not believe a single event that happens in the anime.When you pick a school setting for your work of fiction, you can go down two paths, a realistic depiction of high school life with down to earth, believable characters (for example, Hibike! Euphonium), or an absurd depiction of high school with extraordinary events and out-of-this-earth characters (for example, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu). These paths aren’t that well defined, and most of the time you can get away with mixing absurd characters with regular high school events (for example, Chuu2Koi), which ends up being quite a nice way of showing what a character is going through, be it a completely exaggerated depiction of an emotion or an emphasis on the importance of a particular event in the character’s life. Chuu2Koi does this with chuuni magic battles, Monogatari does this with long elaborate dialogue, although Monogatari isn’t your typical high school setting show. Point is, your story and characters have to be believable or relatable. You want the reader or viewer to care for the characters you’ve written. As for Tomozaki, his only relatable point is that he’s a loner, and so are most anime watchers. Nobody will relate to being the best at a certain game, and very few will relate to being competent to a high level at a certain game, and most certainly NOBODY will relate to Tomozaki’s character progression. Without being relatable, the main character now must appeal to the audience with his actions, most of which are dictated by a third party or happenstance. He’s effectively a puppet of the other characters in the show, sometimes adding his own ad lib to the situations he finds himself in. Even after becoming a “normie” 5 episodes in, Tomozaki just comes off as bland and uninteresting. He’s nothing like OreGairu’s Hachiman who’s a way better example of a loner working on himself in order to become a better human being. This is the main problem, Jaku-Chara is too unrealistic to be a down to earth high school romcom, and too ordinary to be an absurd high school romcom. The viewer is stuck in a situation where they cannot relate to the main character while also not being able to enjoy his personality or the results of his actions. They cannot “suspend their disbelief” in order to fully invest themselves in the show.The other characters don’t help. Aoi has no personality, she hardly even fits a trope. She’s somewhat twofaced, but not enough for her to be an appealing or interesting character. Minami isn’t a character; I refuse to acknowledge that someone wrote her as she is. She’s an amalgamation of completely different charm points and gags that the writer probably finds appealing in a waifu. She is so over-the-top energetic that it becomes hard to watch any scene that involves her. Izumi is your generic high school girl, again, without a personality. Out of the female characters, this only leaves Kikuchi, voiced by Kayano Ai, who I like a lot, and Hanabi, who’s cute and inoffensive. I could mention the male characters, but other than Nakamura, who’s sort of another rival to Tomozaki, they, yet again, serve no purpose and just act as filler content, NPCs for Tomozaki to interact with.Speaking of Kayano Ai, her and Nobuhiko make this show bearable. The rest of the voice actors are unremarkable at best, obnoxious at worst. Hasegawa Ikumi does an awful job at Minami, but then again, Minami is an abomination of a character, so that’s most likely because of poor direction.The opening is a cheerful song by DIALOGUE+, an unknown idol group, and sounds as generic as you’d expect it to. I thought it was ok at first, but it very quickly got obnoxious to listen to. The ending is unremarkable, as one would expect.Finally, the art and character design are fine. They’re bland, and I absolute hate the modern character design standards when it comes to drawing eyes and faces, but that’s just me. Again, unremarkable, but at least the animation isn’t appalling.Without a solid and interesting story, Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun fails to entice the viewer with its unremarkable characters. The viewer finds themselves watching seemingly unbelievable events unfold as the main character lackadaisically moves from happenstance to happenstance that just happen to work out in his favour. Without achievements that can be attributed to Tomozaki’s efforts, the show feels like an empty shell with no substance, an exhibition of events that collectively have no impact.There is very little to take away from Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun, I wouldn’t recommend trying Aoi’s advice in real life, let alone watching the show. If you want a good story about a loner working on himself, watch OreGairu.TL;DR:Pros:-Kayano Ai voicing a cute taciturn bookworm-The first couple of episodes and tipsCons:-Unremarkable characters-Unbelievable events-The show fails to suspend the viewer’s disbelief-Little to no substance – an exposition of random events-Minami-Awful pacingFinal Score: 2/10Thank you Kayano Ai for saving this show from being a 1/10.

God bless.', 'I don\'t understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this. From what I can see, it\'s simply a show with decent art and a possibly interesting start.The main point of this show is that an unsocial high schooler gets tips and tricks from a riaju to help him become more social. The premise is really quite stupid as in real life, unsocial people wouldn\'t be talking with others let alone one of the most popular people in the school.The characters in this show are somewhat unique, but they\'re mostly all disgusting people. Take the riaju for example. Her meeting with the main character is...through a game called ""tackfam"" or essentially a rip off of super smash where she\'s rated 2nd in the game while the mc is 1st. To me, her real reason of meeting him is to find someone that\'s better than her and I\'m assuming to date or hang out with. Unfortunately for her, she meets the mc, an unsocial guy in her class, and some of her first few words to him are just insults.What is her problem? I\'m not really sure, but she clearly believes that he\'s failed in the game of life. She\'s utterly disappointed that the only person that she found that was better than her was a quitter and basically a loser. The fact that you only respect people better than you is absolutely disgusting.She accuses the mc of quitting in the game of life and that he\'s not a ""gamer"" and the mc is forced to either accept that he\'s a loser or get better in the game of life. However, there\'s nothing wrong with quitting. If you\'re doing drugs and someone explained that you\'re a quitter for quitting drugs, is there something wrong with that? She then decides to help him win in life. Why? There\'s really no reason for you to help him out at all, but one possibility is that you\'re improving him to date him.She goes on to create a set of goals to help him improve, and one of them specifically is to get a girlfriend. Dating someone for the sake of achieving a goal is honestly really disgusting. You\'re toying with other people\'s feelings to simply feel good about achieving your goal and not to nurture the relationship. She clearly doesn\'t care about other people, yet other people view her as a goddess.Another thing she recommends the mc to do is to memorize conversation topics. Yes. Memorize conversation topics. Does anyone actually do this because if they do, they definitely have some serious problems. Additionally, she tells him to start a conversation with a female. As someone with few friends in real life, I can confidently say that it\'s nearly impossible for me to do so and it will certainly be awkward. However, the mc feels practically nothing. While it is awkward, he breezes past it like doing so is normal. He doesn\'t even have a fml moment and acts like nothing happened.The mediocre plot and the appalling characters make this show an absolute wash. While a few moments are nice and some characters are waifu material, I don\'t think they can save the show.3/10 through a game called ""tackfam"" or essentially a rip off of super smash where she\'s rated 2nd in the game while the mc is 1st.

Video game is a hobby that has become synonymous with society especially with the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Of course, that’s the real world I’m talking about. Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun takes place in a fictional world that shows how one character decided to be a bottom-tier loser. And how does he spend all his time? Playing video games. Talk about being a degenerate.Based on the light novel, I admit coming into this series intimidated me a bit at first. Watching Tomozaki’s life as a gamer contrasts greatly between his real life image. It’s almost...like he’s living a double life. In the virtual world, he is unstoppable and a pro gamer. But from the real world, he’s a friendless loser that people want to avoid. I’m sure this type of character is relatable in some way at a school or workplace you’ve been to. This is a sharp contrast to characters such as Aoi Hinami, Mizusawa, or Mimimi. Those three represent the popular kids at school, the type that everyone wants to be friends with.Speaking of Aoi Hinami, she meets Tomozaki after the two faces each other in an online game. It doesn’t take long for her to realize Tomozaki’s outer image. So what happens then? She decides to teach him to play real life. That’s right, Tomozaki has his own personal life coach. It’s the hardest game Tomozaki will ever have to play because life is not like a game. He lacks friends, social experience, and in general, has a low self-esteem. No wonder he’s at the bottom tier. This is where Aoi’s role comes in. She teaches Tomozaki how to win at life but it doesn’t come easy. From the first few episodes, we see how lonely he is with a depressive attitude. He is afraid of himself especially with what he says to others and hence, he always try to be responsive than initiating conversations. It’s not until Aoi enters his life that he begins to change. Because in her opinion, Tomozaki can be just as great in real life compared to video games.From a character perspective, it’s shown that Tomozaki is actually quite intelligent and always analyzing situations before acting. Although he lacks confidence, he isn’t afraid of being honest and himself. Being truthful to others is especially important as creating a fake image is no way at winning in life. This contrasts to Mimimi, a popular girl who hides her vulnerable façade behind her cherry personality. With Aoi’s influence, Tomozaki begins to open up more including changing his appearance to be look more appealing and even learning how to smile. His social skills also improve as he learns from Aoi through first-hand experience. This includes talking to girls, going on a vacation trip, and interacting with the popular teens at school. It’s like Tomozaki is following a walkthrough with Aoi as her guidance. He’s not just playing the game. He’s living it.By storytelling standards, you get what you expect. Every episode has Tomozaki advancing forward in some way or form in real life. He makes new friends while gaining new skills and even an appreciation in himself. Now obviously, you have to be patient to see how Tomozaki changes but let’s just say that he makes quite bit of progress. Unfortunately, this doesn’t apply to his relationship status with the main cast. Even with the time they spend together, it feels like Tomozaki and Aoi’s relationship really went nowhere. Being labeled as a romantic dramedy, you’d at least have to expect some form of development right? Well not quite. From the first episode to the last, this show does a bottom tier job at relationship development. I’m not even entirely sure why this anime has ‘romance’ tagged under its umbrella. There’s barely any romantic elements in this show besides the ship teasing. Tomozaki and Aoi is the complete opposite of each other that it’s almost like Beauty and the Beast. His relationship with Izumi and Mimimi also goes to nowhere. So if you came to this show with a curiosity about romance, this is not the right place.Finally, I would like to mention that while the show has its fair share of drama, it’s mostly light so don’t expect the anime to be a tearjerker either. In fact, I’d label this show more of a lighthearted drama with a big chunk of social dialogues. Whether the show has its right target audience can be a bit ambiguous. However, this isn’t a complex storyteller either. It’s simply about a guy following a walkthrough in a real life.While the show isn’t a grand spectacle to look at, I will give credit where credit is due. The character designs appeals to teenage youth especially for the popular characters. It seems the camera itself is self-aware that focuses on certain body parts of the female cast. Whether this is intentional or not is up to you decide but it’s obvious the anime wanted to give the female cast an appealing image, especially for the popular characters. On the other hand, Tomozaki is portrayed with a moody face and dressed like a loner. Of course, it isn’t until he meets Aoi that his image begins to shine more. Finally, this show pays its video game homage. Attack Families is obviously based on the popular Super Smash Bros. franchise. It’s actually quite clever the show decided to pay homage to Super Smash Bros. as it’s among the most popular fighting game in the world.Look into his eyes and what do you see? A changed man or someone who didn’t win the game? Tomozaki has his life coach this season but it’s up to him to follow the steps to win. According to the famous Albert Einsten, “life is just like a game and you have to first learn the rules. And then play it better than anyone else”. How do you think Tomozaki played his game? like he’s living a double life. In the virtual world, he is unstoppable and a pro gamer. But from the real world, he’s a friendless loser that people want to avoid. I’m sure this type of character is relatable in some way at a school or workplace you’ve been to. This is a sharp contrast to characters such as Aoi Hinami, Mizusawa, or Mimimi. Those three represent the popular kids at school, the type that everyone wants to be friends with.Speaking of Aoi Hinami, she meets Tomozaki after the two faces each other in an online game. It doesn’t take long for her to realize Tomozaki’s outer image. So what happens then? She decides to teach him to play real life. That’s right, Tomozaki has his own personal life coach. It’s the hardest game Tomozaki will ever have to play because life is not like a game. He lacks friends, social experience, and in general, has a low self-esteem. No wonder he’s at the bottom tier. This is where Aoi’s role comes in. She teaches Tomozaki how to win at life but it doesn’t come easy. From the first few episodes, we see how lonely he is with a depressive attitude. He is afraid of himself especially with what he says to others and hence, he always try to be responsive than initiating conversations. It’s not until Aoi enters his life that he begins to change. Because in her opinion, Tomozaki can be just as great in real life compared to video games.From a character perspective, it’s shown that Tomozaki is actually quite intelligent and always analyzing situations before acting. Although he lacks confidence, he isn’t afraid of being honest and himself. Being truthful to others is especially important as creating a fake image is no way at winning in life. This contrasts to Mimimi, a popular girl who hides her vulnerable façade behind her cherry personality. With Aoi’s influence, Tomozaki begins to open up more including changing his appearance to be look more appealing and even learning how to smile. His social skills also improve as he learns from Aoi through first-hand experience. This includes talking to girls, going on a vacation trip, and interacting with the popular teens at school.

It’s pretty basic and formulaic but it is so pretentious, like it thinks it is so smart. It’s acting like My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU which is actually smart, but it just has no fucking idea what it’s talking about. They try to do the whole social commentary thing but it land flat on it’s fucking face. It was so in your face that any nuance just went right out the fucking window. I mean it was like that in SNAFU as well but at least that one had something...interesting to say and actually had a lot of different arguments and examples. This show can only say one thing and they shove it down your throat at every chance they get. None of the characters are interesting in the slightest and the fucking premise on how they met is stupid. They literally disrespect their own demographic so hard. I mean don’t get me wrong, what they say is true and its demographic absolutely needs to be called out, but like, could they do it in a smarter way? I don’t want to keep comparing it to SNAFU but once again, it’s literally just a better version of this show. Honestly, I never even thought about why I hated this show and I never even made the connection to SNAFU until I started writing this review. I am a genius.

Uh oh, you know what that means right? He has all the qualities to be an epic gamer! Can\'t we all relate to that?Out of all the tropes in anime, this trope of how the number one player of any popular game has to be an introverted sad freak who is unsuccessful in life and unable to fit in, is the worst trope ever. It\'s a dumb and illogical trope. Think about...it, if you\'re the number one player of a very popular game, are you really unsuccessful? Does it really mean that you have no talent and no one has a use for you? Ever heard of e-sports? Let\'s just say that there\'s no e-sports in the world of this anime. Even then it makes no sense. If a game is popular, then a lot of people are wasting their time on it, so obviously people are gonna hold the number one player of that game in some respect. Heck, he could even start teaching others how to get good at the game.But no, if you\'re a number one player of a game, it means that you have no life and you can\'t fit in with other people.Enough rants about gamers and gaming, I\'m not a gamer but I just had to point out how dumb that trope is, since that trope is basically the base of this anime and Tomozaki as a character.Before I begin the actual review, let me point it out that I\'m reviewing this anime, not volume 69 of the novel. I know that there are a lot of light novel purists for this anime, that\'s why I wanted to remind them that I don\'t care about the light novel or what happens in the future story line.The entire first season is just Aoi Hinami, the female MC, trying to teach Tomozaki basic human interaction knowledge, it\'s so fun isn\'t it! Instead of getting professional help, Tomozaki completes daily tasks given by Aoi Hinami. These tasks include forcing yourself to talk to another classmate for a few minutes, ""messing"" with another classmate at least three times and getting a girlfriend. Her idea is that this so called task system resembles a game and if Tomozaki hears the word ""Game"" he must get super horny, so that\'s why she keeps giving him all these tasks daily and increases the difficulty of the task day by day.Every time Tomozaki can\'t do something, he\'ll say that he can\'t do that because he is a ""bottom tier character"". You can\'t get a girlfriend? Oh man you must be a bottom tier character. You don\'t have any friends? You must be a bottom tier character. Tomozaki\'s coping mechanism is so annoying, at one point I\'ve had it with him. He thinks life is a game and whenever Hinami says that ""Think of life as a game!"" He gets all riled up, so riled up that he can do anything! Tomozaki is not a bottom tier character, he is more of a spectator because everything in the anime just happens and he just happens to be near those happenings, it\'s not like he does anything special other than making unfunny jokes which are not really jokes but everyone in the anime laughs anyways.Here is literally a conversation taken right from the anime-Mizusawa: You really are a hard worker. Aren\'t you Tomozaki?Tomozaki: I\'d say I\'m more of a gamer.Mizusawa: You are a funny guyTomozaki: That\'s not really a complimentMisuzawa: It is!That\'s literally one of the conversation. To Tomozaki, this is his idea of messing with someone. And surprisingly, the other character sees Tomozaki as a comedy god, not only that character but literally every other  character laughs at these so called jokes that Tomozaki often makes (That I always seem to miss) and everyone starts laughing. If you want, you can ask me for those moments and I will show you a clip of it, you\'ll understand what I mean by ""terrible humour"". I can\'t stand Tomozaki, he\'s pain inducingly cringe. But hey, at least he gets better later.. right?And now, we talk about the other MC of the anime, if you think Tomozaki is bad, boy oh boy, you haven\'t seen anything. Cue Aoi Hinami, a literal deity. She is the perfect human and according to Tomozaki, she is the number one player in the game of life. Let me explain- She\'s good looking, she is popular among her close friends, classmates and the entire school, she is an amazing track runner, she is an amazing basketball player, she is the top student of her class/school, and she is also the 2nd best player of the Super Smash Bros rip-off game that Tomozaki is no. 1 in. See what I mean by a deity? What I fail to understand, even if she puts a ton of effort into all subjects, how is she good at everything? She has enough time to study and become the top student of her school, she has enough time to mingle and maintain a good relationship with her friends, she has enough time to do makeup, she has enough time to practice for basketball, she has enough time to practice track, she has enough time to climb all the way up to the 2nd place in the most popular video game. How? And when Tomozaki called her a top tier character, she probably also says that she had to put a ton of effort, so I\'m guessing she wasn\'t born a deity. Even so, how did she manage to become so good at everything? We have no answer. Even though she\'s good at everything, she claims that her being perfect is only an act. When Tomozaki and Hinami had that little fight where Tomozaki being a reasonable person for ONCE in the entire anime, and Hinami got mad at him. Basically Tomozaki refused to do one of her task which was to confess to a girl, because he thought that those weren\'t his true feelings and he was doing it because Hinami told her to do so. After hearing this Hinami got mad and gave a cringy speech, I might be wrong but from what I understood, all she said was ""What is point of doing what you want? That\'s a waste of time! Doing what others expect of you is a true productive human!"" So basically, in summary, Aoi Hinami is a slave and she was mad that Tomozaki wasn\'t a slave like her.Other characters are boring and have nothing special to them, emphasize on the \'nothing\', absolutely nothing. The side characters are so boring, they often come on screen to remind us that the main characters aren\'t as boring as them.Animation is just average, nothing special to it. All the budget went into animating the lips of female characters, which were the only good thing about this entire anime.The ending sequence, which deserves a better anime, is the only redeeming thing about the sound aspect of this anime. Because voice acting is meh at best and they tried to add sad piano soundtracks like OreGairu and miserably failed.My overall impression of this anime is just bad. I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to anyone. This anime is pseudo deep. The only reason why I thought I should give this a chance was because people claimed that this is as good as OreGairu, which was a massive lie. If you\'re having trouble sleeping, then this anime might help, otherwise if you haven\'t seen it, then don\'t.

MC: (Surprised pikachu face) <-- this is the kind of CRINGE fest that abound in this show portraying an introvert as a socially inept dude who doesn\'t understand basic human interaction. I\'m not even exaggerating, from episode 1 you\'ll see meme-level ""Wow"" reactions from the MC when he\'s being taught about HOW HUMAN SMILES WORK.The main story is about this no-life dude that gives cringe speeches about how life is crap and is obsessed with the Tackfam videogame (basically Super Smash Bros), who then meets a cute...superficial girl who suddenly decides to be his social life coach to make him a chad in no time.Basically, the story is a creep otaku fantasy where a cute girl (who ""coincidentally"" also happens to be a top gamer) will help you get a girlfriend, leading to interactions with more cute girls, and some of them may also want you to teach them how to play your favorite videogame. How cool and UNREALISTIC is that.Simply put, the whole show is very unlikable. We\'re talking about a MC who snaps and yells at people who dare to criticize his favorite videogame.

It did justify the ""comedy"" genre, but somehow I felt it lacked or rather did injustice to""romance"" genre. It was basically a gamer trying to think life as a game too and tried to raise his level but somewhere along the line he realised he wasn\'t doing what he ""really wanted"".It did have some comic moments and its a good slice of life but it wasn\'t, not even a little a romantic anime. It was more like friendly kind of thing and nothing more....But even so, if it does gets a sequel and justifies the ""romance"" part of the story then that would be something to look forward to.Overall, you can watch it if you are bored or something like that.

And some NOOB gamer who is born lucky enough to enjoy cruising through life on Easy Mode, doesn\'t get to talk about life.I should know. I\'ve dominated plenty of games in my day. The Game of Life is (absolutely) garbage, or life is but a shitty game.""- Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki-kun, the central character of the series.Now tell me that doesn\'t hit hard from a #relatable stand-point, because if you don\'t, I don\'t know what to say to you. Go and play some games, you twat. Fraggers only, noobs beware, you\'ll be pwned motherfraggers.Once again, another case of ""I don\'t understand the hate for this show, just because it doesn\'t relate to you doesn\'t mean you can bash it according to your POV."" but in a more controversial way...that is the love-hate relationship surrounding the ""Oregairu meets Gamers!"" in a Netoge-like type of genre mix. Unfortunately, while many are caught off-guard for the amounts of ""introverted, character bias"" cringe straight from Episode 1 alone, this is a show where the unwritten 3-episode rule MUST be followed, and to great lengths, because this show likes to subvert expectations that are mostly based on character drama. A LOT.But let\'s take it from the top. The main story and plot is centralized on one person: MC Fumiya Tomozaki, and you\'re free to characterize him as such: a loner, a NEET, a game champion recognized as the #1 player of the ""TackFam"" rip-off equivalent to Smash Bros., anything that resembles the gamer-y status that rhymes and categorizes well with the shrill-haired, depressing-looking MC. That is, until the #2 top player spot came around and challenged him to some matches, and no surprise, Tomozaki aces them all. What\'s the surprise you ask? The person is a girl, and to make things even more surprising, also goes to his school, is widely considered as the school idol, and Her name: Aoi Hinami. The two meet IRL, and seeing how much disheveled Tomozaki looks and sounds, it doesn\'t take long for Aoi to figure out his shitty IRL game, and the training ensues from the top-tier character to train the bottom-tier character in breaking out of his own shell and learning to socialize like a typical normie with classmates-turned-friends as the series progresses its paces.The never-ending, unnerving stigma with such gamery-like situations is that circumstances like this are bound to go the usual tropey and cliche one-way street of love and relationships (see Gamers! and even Project No.9\'s 2016 Netoge show). In Tomozaki-kun, this trope is anything BUT that. In fact, this can be closely inferred more towards Oregairu in the realm that Tomozaki is like Hachiman in every lingering way of the monologue: being so downbeat from the very start, and it\'s with more interaction from other side characters that only brings out both the best and worst in each character with the passing time. Furthermore, going from being only able to judge from a perceived view of a personal bias to learning what should be the right or wrong responses, and that\'s where the show shines at its best. If anything, I\'d like you to keep an open mind about Tomozaki, because his character development is very tightly paced to fit into the many situations in the show, and therein sets the difference between the life of a NEET and the life of a normie of his own depiction that shows his slow but gradual development from knowing that ""Making friends isn\'t so hard, you just have to reach out in any possible opportunity."" to ""Stupid replies in conversations are actually OK when you\'re friends in a clique."" I know I\'ve personally went through that rite of passage before, and from an otaku standpoint, it hits harder than it usually did. But for the many who\'ve experienced the top-tier treatment, you\'re also not wrong in the sense to create the maligning bias of such extreme levels of otaku-ness. All you need to do, is just understand where they\'re coming from, such as the case studies of socialism in general.Unsurprisingly, the character cast is the sole highlight of the show, and where all the School-esque-based drama and ""romance"" helps in defining what Tomozaki-kun is all about. For realism\' sake to keeping this show in pure authenticity, I\'ll label them by their cliques:- The ""romance"" clique of Aoi ""NO NAME"" Hinami, Minami ""Mimimi"" Nanami, and Fuka Kukichi:The feeling of knowing the school idol who is regarded as the ""perfect existence"" ever to grace humanity, is as potent, both in anime and IRL, and Aoi is just that: excelling at everything from studies to sports while maintaining the standard of a likable personality that everyone can count upon, but her policy is putting in terrifying amounts of hard work, and being an avid strong believer of concrete, dedicated effort in order to succeed at everything there is in life, while deep within the barricade of the ""ideal character"" façade, she holds true to her own beliefs, and wouldn\'t grace others trying to trample her perfect record that sounded like insults to injuries. Subsequently, the relationship between her and another girl in the same Track-and-Field team is a ferocious one. Minami, like Aoi, wishes to dethrone Aoi\'s top spot like the constant admiration from all distances, and is jealous of her popularity despite being the cheerful demeanor of a joker character she wears on her face. But deep within, like Tomozaki, she feels insecure about her ownself and the personality that clashes with the change of mood. It\'s a blast to have Minami always being the meditator when situations are hard to call it off and resolve conflicts amicably. Of the 3 girls, Fuka Kikuchi stands as the most introvertedly reserved, yet innocent character that I can relate to the most, because that\'s where most of Tomozaki\'s normie ""motives"" are relayed to. A libarian and simultaneously a bookworm, both Tomozaki and Fuka started off on the wrong foot about their interests, creating the typical nonsense misunderstanding. But as both hit it off with Aoi\'s conquest for Tomozaki to start befriending and ""capturing"" for relationship\'s sake, they eventually come onto their own, and Tomozaki pretty much accepting the kind allures of Fuka, only makes the heart grow fonder for the potentials of a real boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. Honestly IMO, the prospects of Tomozaki and Fuka are quite high for the ""perfect\' relationship acquired for a normie, but sadly that wasn\'t part of the focus from the very first place.- The ""over-dramatized"" clique of Erika Konno, Hanabi ""Tama"" Natsubayashi, and Yuzu Izumi:To anyone who\'s been in Eriko\'s shoes, please don\'t be a sullying bully, please. The world has enough trouble of bullies trying to make their mark like a domineering person that has people cower in fear, no more of that. The detractors of Yuzu Izumi and Hanabi Natsubayashi are also just that. Being the social and empathetic classmate, Yuzu cares for her friends alot, and mostly dislikes conflicts, so when Eriko tries to go on her condescending bullying stance, she\'s afraid to speak out, and it\'s a legitimate reason that places pride over humanity. Besides being the first target of Tomozaki\'s for opening friendships, she has a crush on Nakamura, so the interweaving line between the two is through Smash in order to get closer to him. Similarly, Hanabi (or Tama to refer easily), like Tomozaki, is blunt and unsociable, and due to the case of being an easy target for bullying from Eriko, she\'s unceremoniously made into a nervous wreck. But it\'s by the grace of Minami\'s happy-go-lucky spirit that she starts to open up and therefore, create the idolizing caricature of a friendship that she holds dear and close to her heart, always concerned for Minami and caring from a distance. That\'s the hallmarks of a cherished friend for long-running friendships.- The ""Three Stooges"" clique of Shuji Nakamura, Takahiro Mizusawa and Takei:When you have such competitive friends that always blames the circumstances rather than themselves, you KNOW that they\'re quite the nuisance, and this is the case with Nakamura. Another TackFam player that mostly plays to achieve victory, he\'s quite the petty gamer to the point of being obnoxious when he loses, a sign of the over-competitiveness of his character. Initally one to coin the ""garbage game"" term when facing against the ranked No. 1 IGN ""nanashi"" himself, and blaming the game rather than his lack of skills coupled with some ""bad"" luck, he\'s just as what Tomozaki refuted him to be: ""A gamer\'s biggest shame"". Overtime, as both guys counter it out, Nakamura begins to see the light and evenutally accepts Tomozaki\'s prowess, which does not look like a lot, but it is in fact A LOT. Takahiro, more than just the ladies\' man, being the smartest and wisest member of the clique, he\'s Tomozaki\'s role model of achievements. And last but not least, Takei is akin to Minami in the sense that he\'s the mood clicker of the clique, but he can\'t be relied upon since he\'s the most dense member as well, despite being a spontaneous sport for some idiotic clown-like entertainment being the center of attention.In a nutshell, each character is made to serve a purpose, and not just for simple pleasantries either in every stage of character development towards the central MC that is Fumiya Tomozaki. It feels so apt, yet so satisfying to see character development done so well at that level.In other words, I have nothing to rant about the low-budget feel of Project No. 9\'s works, almost every other show before and after it just looks the same from every crease and angle. The most notable is in the original character designs, done by Fly (of Iroduku fame) that is easy to miss with character designer Akane Yano\'s usual studio work, but is strikingly done on a high pedestal of artistic levels, well done. Same likewise with the music, it\'s just so-so with the usual idol group level of decent song repertoires, but man did DIALOGUE+ nail the OST so well with this one. Also, shoutout to music composer Hiromi Mizutani for another fantastic run of his composition (from Non Non Biyori to Tanaka-kun), it creates the whole immersive effect of the show that contributes to the enjoyment of a not-so-cringe show.Hey y\'all, Tomozaki-kun is not as bad as it looks, and IS certainly not cringey as it sounds. This show is some deep, inducing learning traits of socialism and the way how social interaction is done IRL, and all I can say is: I\'ve stuck from the beginning, and never dropped it because there\'s something special about this show (other than being the 2nd show of Project No. 9 to score a 7+ rating, but the 1st to clinch the highest among many mediocre contemporaries in years). If you\'re still skeptical, take this show with a pinch of salt, but don\'t be going all salty about it. talk...they\'re unreasonable and unbalanced.

If you\'re still skeptical, take this show with a pinch of salt, but don\'t be going all salty about it.', 'I\'d hate to see a good show with genuine, heartfelt content in it be dried up in what could be considered by some a poor adaptation, and by the more autistic fans perhaps a ""normie filter"".It\'s almost disheartening to see how poor the presentation of this show is in general. The art direction is incredibly bland, with the backgrounds showcasing the most generic depictions of modern day Japan in history and Fly\'s very pretty art being placed into animation that doesn\'t quite match up with the pristine glittery nature of his designs. The music, while good, is horribly misplaced and and throws off the...tones of certain scenes by a substantial amount. The pacing of the adaptation is horrid, with the first 3 episodes whizzing past you without you having even a clue about what\'s happenign or where the story is headed.All of the above, compounded by a bizzare ""epic gamerz"" hook that has little to nothing to do with the show\'s themes other than an extremely broad ""life is like a video game"" thing that Hinami and Fumiya like to throw around sometimes and the rather cringe-inducing way Fumiya acts in the beginning seems to have driven people away in droves.Indeed, this is the return of the ""omg he is so me"" type of protagonist that seems to eternally exist within the deep realms of our minds that everybody loves to see on screen. He\'s doesn\'t care what anybody thinks! He\'s got no friends! He\'s a super cool sigma male who\'s here to spit on your corpse and fuck your wife! They\'ve existed forever and will probably never go away because there\'s always going to be that one demographic of people who loves to eat this shit up. These type of omegaloner protags seem to always pull the salt of the guys who stare in from outside, calling them edgy or losers or incels or whatever shitty term is in favor that year.What strikes me as odd is how these characters all seem to categorically blend together in people\'s minds. As an example, Hachiman, an unsociable kid who\'s never had a real chance to make any friends, and Ayanokoji, a psychopath who doesn\'t understand the concept of friendship, are two incredibly different characters who\'s stories have little in common. And yet, despite their rather unnuanced differences, people have still just collectively grouped them up into the same type of person for what seems to just be the superficial reason of ""they\'re like, both loners or something, right?"". Maybe it\'s just because all of these guys always seem to be randomly packing heat, or maybe it\'s because the anime adaptations of these light novels are always shit, but regardless of how high Excaliber stands, the title of King can only ever belong to one.It doesn\'t mean that there\'s no reason that all of these characters always seem to attract the same type of audience, however. There is obviously some reason why these characters are all grouped together. The real categorization, instead, should probably be the ""unmotivated protagonist"". Never wanting to do anything, never wanting to change, and letting destiny coincidently fall into their hands before they even deliberate on acting. This description rings true for almost all of the lowlife good-for-nothing le ""i was bullied 40 years ago"" guys that sit on their ass and wait for Misaki\'s salvation.Fumichad is not that type of guy.Waking up at 8 am on Saturday morning, he wakes up and gets out of bed. The ground shakes before him as he marches onwards to open up his Nintendo Switch and grab a Gamecube controller from depths of his asshole, he sits on the smelly destroyed cushion on the floor of his room. His hands already ramp up to 10 billion APM, as he ghosts some combos before his button inputs could be detected by the console.Fumiya is a guy that just has his priorites elsewhere, and this show is just a show about a guy that shifts his motivations towards self improvement into the real world.That\'s pretty much it. This show is about a loser improving both himself and his surroundings through his own effort and Hinami\'s guidance. For anybody going into this show, please do not take this as another crusade against society and those who have wronged us. It isn\'t a critque of society at large, but rather the of the indiviual. For what the show is offering and for what you could consider a ""call to action"" for so many losers in the otaku community, transcendent of cultural boundries. I\'d love to exist in a dimension where the struggles of the Tomokos of society are free to suffer in their own patheticness without dirty looks from others, but while real life is much a place where nobody can care enough about anybody else to really think that way, the losers of the world are very quick to rise up and tell those other losers how much better they are then them.If I\'ve been using too many shitty analogies or whatever, what I\'m trying to say is that writing the show off as bad because it\'s ""cringe"" or whatever is pretty retarded.And to the same extent, please don\'t disregard the show if you disagree with what Hinami seems to view as a ""winning state"" in life. The series is rather careful of what it likes to showcase as the right and wrong morals a character might act upon, and isn\'t caught up in broadcasting the author\'s personal beliefs through a holy messiah.But saying that brings up another question: if this show isn\'t a drama series or a romance series, what is this show really about?Tomozaki-kun is a rather unenjoyable show. I\'ll reiterate though that this anime\'s presentation is really quite shit. The art is below average and the soundtrack is incredibly distracting due to a bizzare inconsistency between the mood of the certain scenes and what track plays in the background. The pacing of the show is absolutely horrendous, too, and will feel incredibly rushed and confusing until the later half of the show.The show itself isn\'t very entertaining. The comedy is subpar at best, the majority of Fumiya\'s dialogue with other characters aren\'t very interesting, and a lot of Fumiya\'s behaviour is at best sad and at worst incredibly cringe-inducing. It\'s all compounded by the fact that many of the people who wouldn\'t mind that last part too much are completely scared away because half the cast, and especially Hinami, can be seen as both the idealized and totemized versions of the perfect riajuu.It\'s basically driven many people in it\'s own target demographic away from the start. Of course, being lonely and antisocial isn\'t wrong nor is wanting to experience relationships in a natural, more genuine matter, but many seem to already have taken whatever Hinami said and just ran away with it like the author has injected his own blood and tears into her words.Keep in mind that Tomozaki-kun isn\'t a romance series or a proper drama series until the later volumes/season 2, either. So what we\'ve really been left with seems to be an adaptation not too disimilar to the ""quality difference"" between the Monogatari\'s series\' first and second seasons.But for anybody who\'s interested in seeing the show, please keep your balls empty and your mind open to whatever is to come, and I promise you that you will have a much better time then you would otherwise. tones of certain scenes by a substantial amount.

It\'s all compounded by the fact that many of the people who wouldn\'t mind that last part too much are completely scared away because half the cast, and especially Hinami, can be seen as both the idealized and totemized versions of the perfect riajuu.It\'s basically driven many people in it\'s own target demographic away from the start. Of course, being lonely and antisocial isn\'t wrong nor is wanting to experience relationships in a natural, more genuine matter, but many seem to already have taken whatever Hinami said and just ran away with it like the author has injected his own blood and tears into her words.Keep in mind that Tomozaki-kun isn\'t a romance series or a proper drama series until the later volumes/season 2, either. So what we\'ve really been left with seems to be an adaptation not too disimilar to the ""quality difference"" between the Monogatari\'s series\' first and second seasons.But for anybody who\'s interested in seeing the show, please keep your balls empty and your mind open to whatever is to come, and I promise you that you will have a much better time then you would otherwise.', 'An anime necessary for today, Perception of the value of society and balance between being and appearing to be. (forgiveness for the amount of quotes)Introduction:It has always been a social stigma that ""nerds"" and ""weebs"" or even more noncasual entertainment enthusiasts are considered strange and/or complicated to deal, however the most important, Socially Disabled. This idea that these people could not interact naturally in society or that they were a different ""species"" from the ""common"" cause a rejection from the majority of the ""non-nerdy"" people of these niche works, but not because of their content, but of your media,...games, anime and others. Many works like these are simply disregarded for being good or relevant, just by the type of media, and why is that? Due to the social stigma that people know about who consume these types of works. However, it need not be so.Anime Proposal:It is with this in mind that Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun has his premise, many watching the first episode might think that it would be a generic story of the ""introvert boy who delights the popular girl, showing her a new world"" but no, it is the opposite. Aoi, knowing how competent she was in various aspects of life, was disgusted and disappointed to discover that the person who was superior to her in Atafam, was just another complainer who never gave herself the right to try something new in his life. And this is the biggest problem in the nerdy world, hiding from the rest of the world instead of raising your head and saying ""Yes, those are my tastes, but I am not inferior to you in any aspect of life"" or ""Yes, I can see super niche anime but have common conversations in a group of friends, I can play super old and unknown games and be a good speaker, I can have a healthy loving relationship, I can go to parties, I can dress well, I can be beautiful, admired, etc.""All these prejudices have become so deeply ingrained in society that the nerds themselves have come to believe this lie, that they are a ""separate society"" that cannot be mixed. It was understanding the creative metaphors used by Aoi with games and with Tomozaki wanting to try to improve and leave his bubble, which captivated me right away.Of course, fiction is different from real life and each person deals with different problems and to different degrees, I don’t deny this, I will even talk more about it when I comment soon on the final plot of the season. However, regardless of these variables, the anime teaches (through Aoi) several small important daily actions that with the necessary effort and dedication, they succeed, gradually removing people from their private hull and beginning to realize that not all people are bad, or they want your harm, just a change of perspective can replace the colors of how you see life, learn new things, like hobbies that  you never imagined you would like, have new ideals or even change your life completely, just allowing yourself to discover the new.THIS PART CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSConclusion of Anime:Passing the episodes of the anime, even with the natural difficulty in the beginning, Tomozaki progresses very well, finishing practically all the challenges of Aoi, except in declaring himself to Fuuka, and it is at that moment that the anime added a new tier that I consider very interesting, which is the question of the balance between being presentable and being sincere.As I said before, I am aware that each human being has their individualities and differences and that not everything that works for one will work for another, and despite having accepted Aoi\'s challenge, Tomozaki began to question how far it really is beneficial to  yourself to maintain that social mask, sacrificing important parts of your being. Questioning originated from Fuuka, when he said that Tomozaki without a ""mask"" was easier to talk to, and when noticing that Aoi for working so hard to polish his mask, does not realize that she fails to enjoy the game of life in many moments to maintain your posture.It was then that Tomozaki when confronting his ""teacher"", has a perfect conclusion in my opinion, which was to seek a Hybrid ideal, someone who continues to try to behave well in society, absorbing everything it offers but without leaving aside your individualities and desires, things that Tomozaki noticed that Aoi had completely forgotten and was the reason she never managed to beat  him in Atafam, even though she was perfect in everything else.He then ends with another great gamer metaphor that doesn\'t matter how high your level is in the game, everything becomes very empty if it doesn\'t give you pleasure, however, pleasures that you will only be able to know completely, if you are willing to know all the mechanics of the game and strive to learn them before saying that it is a ""junk game"", thus achieving the balance between entertainment and success. games, anime and others.

There probably isn't one to begin with, so expecting to get it from...an anime is a bit much. But just rising the question is already good enough to make this anime worth it.

It was difficult to even watch some of the MC\'s outbursts. There are no spoilers in this review because it literally says on the show description ""Aoi decides to assist him in succeeding in what she calls the greatest game of them all."" Taken straight from MAL itself I only elaborate on the ""Game of Life"" and MC being a ""Tackfam"" friendless gamer. Tackfam is basically the anime equivalent of Smash Bros. I only elaborated on Aoi helping Tomozaki in the game...of life/friends/social stuff. It\'s already there in the MAL show description and there are no specific details or spoilers.I don\'t like the plot or characters at all. The idea of ""changing yourself"" to fit into some social norm is the very opposite of modern day society. People have been working hard to promote ""self acceptance"" and being yourself. But this show undermines all of that. It demonstrates a beta male trying to ""fix himself"" because a woman told him to. Said woman who blindly insults him heavily without even trying to get to know him. Main female character is extremely disrespectful and only cares about the status quo. MC is talked into being more ""normal"" and I severely disagree with the idea of changing yourself to someone else\'s ideals.So yeah, story and characters are dreadful in my opinion. The entire base for this story is terrible. I genuinely hope the MC gets a mind of his own and starts thinking for himself. And maybe one day he can leave the girl in the dust or tell her off because she deserves it. After their first meeting you can see exactly what type of person the girl is. I don\'t care if she has ""pride"", that\'s no excuse for her to be disrespectful to other people.The only saving graces are the smooth artwork and the potential for the MC to develop into a thoughtful person that can have his own opinion and be himself.

The MC is an absolute loser who\'s only interest in life is to be the best at Smash Bros (or TackFam how the show calls it).He meets up with the second best player, who turns out to be the perfect girl from his class who\'s just the best at everything. She is disappointed because her nemesis is such a loser and proceeds to teach him how to succeed in life.Since they are both nerds, they use Videogame Speak and treat real life just like a game. Aoi (the girl btw) starts giving Tomozaki...quests what to do in real life and he does so because he doesn\'t have anything better to do anyways.People would call this cringe - and guess what, it is. That is the point, you\'ve reached the conclusion - treating real life as just another game with quests and XP is cringe. Do you honestly think a healthy person would act that way?Turns out, Aoi has problems on her own, although they are not that visible. She tries harder than anyone else at everything and thus becomes the best almost every time. Like a Robot.In school she has this mask on and noone except Tomozaki ever glimpsed behind it.If you realize this, the show is really great in my opinion. This is not ""Loser MC gets rescued by Pixi maniac dream girl"" - this is a loner dude who gets in contact with a highly functioning sociopath. At least in my opinion.so overall this is a 9/10 for meAnd if you are not sold, at least listen to the Opening - don\'t you want to try better in liife after listening to the ""Ganbatte, Ganbatte..."" ? quests what to do in real life and he does so because he doesn\'t have anything better to do anyways.People would call this cringe - and guess what, it is.

One of the genres is attributed as 'drama' but there's not a lot of it and it's certainly not a focus. It's a bit closer to a comedy. If you like shows where there's positive progression without forced drama and out-of-nowhere spanners being thrown into the machinery, then this is for you.Our loner protagonist Tomozaki Fumiya doesn't...stand out in school, in fact he's ignored and similarly ignores people around him, being somewhat unsatisfied with life. Instead he's poured his time and effort into a 'Smash' like title and achieved the number one rank in all of Japan.One player by the name of NO_NAME consistently challenges him in game and upon their latest loss requests to meet with Tomozaki in real life, only for both of them to find out that they know each other. From class.Revealed to be the most popular girl in school, Hinami Aoi is disappointing in finding out that the one person she can't beat is the class loner, a loser who's given up on the ultimate game: Life. She delivers a harsh verbal beat down of the kind of person Tomozaki is and to her surprise he doesn't lash out or gets insecure, he concedes that she's right.The story continues as Hinami sets goals or achievements for Tomozaki to reach in his social life, with the perspective of it being like a game. Social interaction? Clothes coordination? Going out with people? Why not treat it all as something to work at and win?---Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki is an interesting show for the sake of how people look at social life in their day to day and how they approach goals.The writing is clever albeit a bit contrived when Tomozaki consistently gets shocked at the new goals set, which in reality aren't really that high of a bar, even for an introvert lacking in social skills.The characters seem quite believable to me and are flawed enough to be interesting and give the show enough depth to entertain without it being an all out drama.If I were to critisize something, it'd be that his world class skill in one of the most popular and beloved games of all time (being an equivalent to Smash) plays almost no role. It may be a focus in season 2, but for now it's a story hook. You'd think he'd be playing competitively in tournaments or the like or would be a streamer at the very least. It feels like a missed opportunity.On the flip side if you enjoy drama-thriller or soap opera moments, then this will seem comparatively tame and may even come off as a bit boring. This is definitely more of a casual relax and enjoy kind of show. stand out in school, in fact he's ignored and similarly ignores people around him, being somewhat unsatisfied with life.

So interested in reading the manga."", 'I don\'t typically write reviews for the anime I watch. This is, in fact, my first one. Often, I feel that I\'m not quite qualified to judge anime as a medium, or as an art. And so, when I scroll down and read a few reviews on the anime I watch, some of which I may disagree with, they\'re typically well thought-out and give context for the reason the author feels the way they do.For some unfortunate reason, this anime has had little luck in garnering such reviews. Opinion pieces galore, apparently. So I will do my best to help fill this void.STORY: 7The story...isn\'t groundbreaking, by any means. So far it\'s very otaku-plus-normie, and the common circumstances that follow. However, I feel the author has taken time to spice things up a bit—it\'s somewhat reminiscent of `Welcome to the NHK!, insofar as the normie (Hinami) attempts to show the otaku (Tomozaki) what life is really about. The joys of it, all that. But, even in this comparison, the dynamic between Tomozaki and Hinami is a little unique.One review calls it too coincidental that they\'re both top players at Attack Families, but I don\'t necessarily see this as an issue. Coincidence is alright, so long as it isn\'t a slap in the face, a la some unearned and last-minute Deus Ex Machina. This tie between the two main characters also lends itself to increasing the depth in Tomozaki and Hinami\'s friendship. Hinami initially looks up to Tomozaki, idealizing his online persona as a hard-working and impressive individual. Learning that your idol is a loser whose given up at life is some tough shit, and the story itself is (so far) Hianmi\'s love letter to her own way of living. This is all to say, the coincidence exists, but everything that comes of it flows naturally and is well-earned.ART: 7I feel woefully incapable of judging this. The art isn\'t going to blow your socks off like Promare or Mob Psycho or Your Name, but it\'s fair for a middling anime whose budget probably isn\'t topping any charts. That\'s to say, nothing is popping out as a big ""hey look at this bad animation""; it\'s pretty pleasant to look at.SOUND: 7I am once again out of my depth judging this. To give context, the only anime where I\'ve been truly impressed with the sound design is Re:Zero, mostly seasons 2 & 2, Part 2. So I suppose in comparison to that, the sound design is meh. But taking it from the POV of the generally good anime that come out every season, the sound is a-ok.CHARACTERS: 8While we\'re only on episode 4, I have a strong feeling the character development is going to continue along a good path. A reviewer mentioned that handling a large cast can be quite difficult, and I much agree with this. The ~12-13 characters that Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun seems to focus on makes giving each one a coherent personality quite the challenge. So far, however, the anime has done an excellent job. Each character has their \'identity\', I suppose, but they too have quirks and traits that make them unique in spite of that.All-in-all, for characters, I think the show really shines when it gets several of them talking together. Tomozaki and Hinami\'s time together is (so far) mostly a deconstruction of those moments, which is perhaps why I feel they\'re so strong for the anime—if the two main characters are going to be focusing on a moment, it\'s sensible to have that moment be a bright spot for the show.ENJOYMENT: 8I really feel that Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is shaping up to be a solid watch this season. It won\'t be shattering any records here on MAL or anything like that, but I doubt very much that I\'ll drop this or regret having picked it up. The show\'s got passing marks for the more artful aspects, and it seems to have a head on its shoulders for story and character development. So, overall...OVERALL: 8I\'m giving it an 8 for now, mostly from a place of optimism. I\'m comfortable rating it an 8 so far, because I think `8` is a good spot for anime that aren\'t doing anything wrong, and they\'re getting a lot of things right. It\'s just a cut above an \'average\' anime worth watching, which I consider 7 to convey.Hopefully this wasn\'t too painful a read. It is, admittedly, difficult to justify one\'s opinions or feeling in a comprehensive way. But I think it\'s still the most important part of a review—we have to see the process and journey someone took to get to their conclusions, otherwise the conclusions themselves hold no weight. I pray I\'ve managed to do this in my review. isn\'t groundbreaking, by any means. So far it\'s very otaku-plus-normie, and the common circumstances that follow. However, I feel the author has taken time to spice things up a bit—it\'s somewhat reminiscent of `Welcome to the NHK!, insofar as the normie (Hinami) attempts to show the otaku (Tomozaki) what life is really about. The joys of it, all that. But, even in this comparison, the dynamic between Tomozaki and Hinami is a little unique.One review calls it too coincidental that they\'re both top players at Attack Families, but I don\'t necessarily see this as an issue. Coincidence is alright, so long as it isn\'t a slap in the face, a la some unearned and last-minute Deus Ex Machina. This tie between the two main characters also lends itself to increasing the depth in Tomozaki and Hinami\'s friendship. Hinami initially looks up to Tomozaki, idealizing his online persona as a hard-working and impressive individual. Learning that your idol is a loser whose given up at life is some tough shit, and the story itself is (so far) Hianmi\'s love letter to her own way of living. This is all to say, the coincidence exists, but everything that comes of it flows naturally and is well-earned.ART: 7I feel woefully incapable of judging this.

Instead, a loser introvert is introduced to a high-profile girl, and she helps our main protagonist become more social and reach the ultimate goal of getting a girlfriend.Although the second episode seemed like a direct insult to me, I may not be that outgoing and would rather play video games and watch shows in my free time to escape reality. I know this sort of lifestyle is sort of lame, so I didn't take any...offence. However, the main girl in the show is such a manipulative woman that she tries to correct our lifestyle by stating that we shouldn't live our lives as they should and should wear a mask to hide our inner selves in order to be more social when communicating with others. I get it if people want that to be your lifestyle and way of life, but do not go out of your way and try to judge other people's ways of life, hoping to make an impact to change it. And I just can't stand that, to be honest.Even though I dislike this character, the personalities and stories of the other characters seem to make up for it, so that's why I have given this anime a 6 rating, considering it a decent anime. offence.

In a way, I feel it\'s more complex than just putting it down to ""change"", the cast is certainly impressive. The original novel got quite good reviews, with highlights about it helping put self-improvement into context and touching on certain facets that\'s not often discussed. I think the original work...is quite intriguingly simple and entertaining. That\'s something not to be underestimated. Sure, conflicts are not too serious, and never quite reach the melodrama such as OreGairu, but it is still endlessly heart wrenching and self-reflective.This is of course, a review of the animation. This is where I have an issue. Let\'s begin with direction. I don\'t have much negative to say about the animation direction, in fact I have little to say about it as a whole. It just unremarkable how pretty and detailed the background and the characters are, and how forgettable the animation was. This is why it\'s an art and not merely procedure work. It\'s not the first time I have had this problem with so-called ""slice-of-life"" animation works. I recently rewatch Girlish Number and boy was the animation work mediocre. That show focused on ""moe"" character\'s facial expression and movement which almost comically missing the point of the show. That might have been a ""meta"" thing, there\'s no excuse for this one. I think OreGairu season 1 deserved this criticism as well, but the animation style was just full of fun, exaggerating character\'s expression so much that the more dramatic season 2 and 3 with bigger budget felt a little too ""serious"". However, I think it can be given a pass as both seasons smartly focused on the right thing, the voice acting, line delivery and shifts between comedy/tension/drama. This, this is the safe, sensitised way to do it.Of course, following animation direction is art. I think the art looks great. Despite the characters not looking as good as the gorgeous LN illustration by Fly, I would actually say some characters came to life in the adaptation, to varying degrees. That\'s not to mention the aforementioned gorgeous background. It\'s quality production.Music doesn\'t quite hit me, but future rewatch might change my opinion. I was too caught up in figuring out why I wasn\'t impressed with the direction.Overall, it\'s a good show and definitely worth the time. Doubly so if you ever have thoughts about self-improvement. Its core message is solid and it is doing more with the concept than going over it, eventually.Extended discussion:I think more can be said about the plot and characters. Some comparison to OreGairu is worth the time in my opinion. To begin, let’s address the controversy about the female lead\'s questionable actions. I feel that certain criticism her way was warranted, but letting it affect the examination of the work is rather misguided. Her actions are not meant to be “gospel”, I think her opinion regarding relationships, human interaction and such are one of the perspectives regarding “self-improvement” or “winning in life” and such. Her character of course is reminiscent of Yukino, albeit in this case, almost complete opposite methodology. I think she plays the role wonderfully, and much better than Yukino in OreGairu in representing a point of view regarding human’s interaction. This is due to her action and opinions are the driving force of the plot, unlike in OreGairu in which the circumstances brought out the faces of the characters. This is most representative in the way that their flaws are explained. Yukino’s facade of flawlessness came from her insecurities due to her family\'s internal competitions and tensions, in which she had to hold up her act. Meanwhile, Hinami’s flaw is something more fundamental to her personality rather than circumstantial. She was so competitive as a person that she put the burden to be perfect on herself and required everything to be competing, like her, to the point of cruelty. These are just 2 different philosophies to construct a story, and both play their roles in their stories.Meanwhile, the contrast between Hachiman and Tomozaki’s goals is also indicative of what kind of self-reflection/story is being told. Hachiman came out as almost a superhuman sometime, willingly endured humiliation and ostracism to “achieve” his goal. Central to his struggle, what the story became about is how to be “normal”. He likes to see himself as being “the hero”, despite much of his monologues about him not being the ideal hero like Hayama. He thinks he can solve everything through his “soft touch”, but when it turns out not to be the case, as with the mess he had with the awkward “love triangle”, it made their relationship approach the point of collapse. This is of course, absurd, very far from anything remotely realistic. He’s the idealised version of what a middle/high schooler dreams of themselves in their own social clique. That being said, it’s the idea of such a person that’s relatable. The way they think and reason.Contrast this to Tomozaki, who’s mostly ordinary in capability, except his godlike ability in video games. His struggle is to be “not normal”, in this case. To be more than what he is or was. This is about self-improvement. He might have been obsessed with making progress, but he was also eventually very keenly aware of the “authenticity” question of self-improvement. If you “improve” yourself, staying out of your comfort zone, are you still truly being yourself? Or are you merely wearing a mask of being a better person? Should you be a better person despite knowing it makes your “true self” miserable? Tomozaki alluded to this with the “love confession”, as he knows engaging in dishonest relationships hurt his conscience, something Hinami dismissed as “weakness”.It’s clear that Hachiman is about how Superman is still human in the end, while Tomozaki is an ordinary human becoming a superhero and the identity and perhaps even ethical questions around it.The self-improvement question posed by Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is quite interesting. As I have elaborated, the clashing opinion regarding the methodology in self-improvement and motivation was somewhat answered in season 1. Your decision and commitment to self-improvement is part of your personality and journey. Not everyone would or could embark on such a journey, and it defines you as much as you define it. I have an anecdotal journey of not self-improvement but more of coming to terms with it. My friend who embarked on such a journey also distanced themselves from the world of anime and Japanese culture as they see it as an obstacle on their journey. I was distraught by it, thinking it would amount to nothing more than the rejection of oneself. However, eventually, I came from the same conclusion as the comic, that their shifting priority and mindset is just part of who they are from the start. This is no different from shifting taste as I aged in which works that I once worshipped seem paled next to those I used to despise or deemed boring. That’s just how changes are. It’s not necessarily destiny, it’s just curves on a track. That’s why I think Tomazaki belongs in the “meaningful” category.Lastly, the contrast between the supporting cast to OreGairu is almost painful. I think OreGairu constructed the supporting cast too much around Hikigaya. Most major, recurring characters are mere love interests for him, so love comedy can happen. They almost didn’t change throughout the story. I would go as far as to say none deserve a spinoff, and all are beaten by Tomozaki’s excellent Nanami. Sure, she got a lot of spotlight early which might have helped her, but she is such a remarkable, defined character that if the main character, Hinami was to be removed, this would still be a compelling work about her. Yui would not have a compelling story about her, nor would Iroha, despite them both being very popular and admittedly loveable characters.That brings me to the conclusion that OreGairu was definitely a more “melodrama”, entertainment focused work. Tomozaki is written tighter, with the self-improvement issue being front and centre and strong characters representing various connections to the issue. Sure, Hachiman is much more interesting and engaging than Tomozaki which seems more like a vessel or self-insertion, but I still find Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun to be pretty good and self-reflective. Between the two I would definitely prefer to rewatch OreGairu, but would recommend Tomozaki to a young audience. is quite intriguingly simple and entertaining.

The areas where this excels are:A real and somewhat realistic premise:a loner who is the #1 player of ""tack fam"" (Super smash bros) in Japan meets the 2nd best player, who turns out to be his popular female classmate. Bc she takes an interest in him and his abilities at the game, questioning why he does not take this competitive spirit into his daily lifeExploration into human behavior:...Real anecdotal examples of human interaction, exploration of group dynamics, social hierarchies, and what constitutes the reasoning behind these hierarchies, i.e. indicators of status, and not having social status.We get to see first hand a novice of social interaction learn bit by bit how to socialize, and his assimilation into a ""popular group"" at schoolWhile of course this is fiction and at times can be silly, I actually found most of the examples this anime depicts of social interactions to be spot on, capturing the subtleties and nuance of communication, and what\'s going on behind the surface.Things like this are rarely talked about, especially in mainstream shows and media, for various reasons. Although I have seen a few anime which do discuss these subjects, this show does it in a light way, yet I keep getting surprised by how accurate the authors portrayal is.Which is why this show easily deserves an (8) out of 10 and earns a ""Very Good"" score.Horimiya, in contrast to this, provides no real premise, other than that a girl and guy at school act differently at school than when they are at home. There are really no dynamic characters, interactions, or engaging storylines happening throughout the show. It\'s pretty much guy goes to girl\'s house, hangs out with her brother, then they go to school, people slowly ask if there\'s something going on between them and then they start dating... The dialog is extremely bland, as is the story. There\'s nothing gripping or engaging about it whatsoever.

The supporting characters, the two main characters, everything feels so coherent somehow. Tomozaki is one of the best main characters of all time for me, as I have never been able to empathise with a fictional character so much. I could understand his struggle and why he acted the way he did in those situations. I see myself in some ways like this character. I too have gone through similar things, which is why this anime plays such a big role for me!Give the anime a chance, hopefully it won't disappoint you! I'm eagerly awaiting the second season. "", 'Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun or bottom-tier Tomozaki, maybe one of the best rom-com genre of this 1st quarter of 2021, but, IMAO, this cannot be consider as a rom-com, since the guy\'s involvement with a girl was more like that of life couch to client relationship, ok, so how do I rate this?????Story-Very Good 8: I may have said that this cannot be consider as a ""Rom-Com"" since there isn\'t any romance that goes between the guy and the girl and  somebody from the forum has already spoiled it. But nevertheless this was one series, where it involves loser guy getting to be introduce into the...life of being a normie , all thanks to one girl who somehow sees him as a game where the challenge was to get him outta his comfort zone of being in the world of ""TrackFam."" Though the rational seem to be too complicated as to why the girl would even wanna help such a guy who was basically juts a loser that thinks all normies should die. But that\'s just it, Original creator , Yuuki Yaku, simply hides every simplest logic in a very complicated rational, but it can also mean that he simply makes use of  such complicated rational  to make up for his lack of story telling given that he only his works only centers around the characters  from his original work....IMAO, his creation would only be his first and maybe his last given that not a lot of mangaka make it.Art: fair 6: Well, despite of the usual eye candies, there really isn\'t any risque fanservices around here , in fact the swimsuit service were just lousy .Sound: fair 6: At one point I kinda like the opening theme ""Jinsei Easy"" by Dialogue, but I kinda hated the seiyuu that did Tomozaki\'s voice.Character: Good 7.So lets go over some of them:Fumiya Tomozaki- Ok, so at frist he was this typical loser guy, who was just into games and games only , where his world only revolves around ""Tackfam"" , what\'s good about him was that he willingly accepted Aoi\'s challege to simply put his game skill where his mouth is by treating the game of life as if he is playing ""Tack Fam"" at first not knowing what to do , he subjects himself to a series of couching that Aoi gives in a form of task that normies would do, even though it was things that Aoi does. At first he likes it when he sees that changes in himself, but for a while there one would have been disgusted when he almost reverted back to his original outcast self, only to realize that he only need to be himself when he establishes a relationship with Kikuchi Fuka, in fact he doesn\'t have to be like Aoi, he only needs to be an extroverted version of himself.Aoi Hinami- She basically has it all, brains, athleticism, influence ,social standing and coming from a higher middle class family, what\'s good about her was that she never abandons Tomaozaki when she realize that the guy she was playing on-line games with would be the out cast loser , Fumiya Tomozaki, rather than just chaste him for destroying her expectation , she help him become a part of that social structure , but in reality she simply tries to make Tomozaki be a version of herself rather than just making Tomaozaki be an extroverted version of himself.Nanami Minami-She basically adds to the drama as somewhat as Aoi\'s competition of being on top of the school\'s hierarchy, but what she is was anther one of Tomozaki\'s classmate that has some for of envy and insecurities.....Shuji Nakamura- Ok, he was one guy whom just like Aoi has everything...almost, except beating a loser like Tomazaki in a game called ""TrackFam"" , now what\'s disgusting about him, was how he waste his time with aloser like Tomaozaki when that\'s what he\'s good at and that he\'s one person would never amount to anything except Shuji himself......Kikuchi Fuka- She may not be anything , but she does provide a ray of sunshine to Tomozaki\'s loser life.....and TBH , the score is for her.Enjoyment: Very Good 8. Unlike rom-com that involves loser guy to top girl this basically takes the cake in it\'s own way, cu\'z it\'s a rom-com that isn\'t a rom-com given the kind of relationship that the guy has for the girl. But, the enjoyable part was seeing the guy adapting to the world or normies by getting out of his comfort zone with a little help from a girl with high social standing.Overall: Fair 6: One part of this anime is good when we see guy gets some help of getting out of his comfort zone, but all that complicated rational in the dialogue makes this anime just too complicated as to what them characters were implying. life of being a normie , all thanks to one girl who somehow sees him as a game where the challenge was to get him outta his comfort zone of being in the world of ""TrackFam."" Though the rational seem to be too complicated as to why the girl would even wanna help such a guy who was basically juts a loser that thinks all normies should die. But that\'s just it, Original creator , Yuuki Yaku, simply hides every simplest logic in a very complicated rational, but it can also mean that he simply makes use of  such complicated rational  to make up for his lack of story telling given that he only his works only centers around the characters  from his original work....IMAO, his creation would only be his first and maybe his last given that not a lot of mangaka make it.Art: fair 6: Well, despite of the usual eye candies, there really isn\'t any risque fanservices around here , in fact the swimsuit service were just lousy .Sound: fair 6: At one point I kinda like the opening theme ""Jinsei Easy"" by Dialogue, but I kinda hated the seiyuu that did Tomozaki\'s voice.Character: Good 7.So lets go over some of them:Fumiya Tomozaki- Ok, so at frist he was this typical loser guy, who was just into games and games only , where his world only revolves around ""Tackfam"" , what\'s good about him was that he willingly accepted Aoi\'s challege to simply put his game skill where his mouth is by treating the game of life as if he is playing ""Tack Fam"" at first not knowing what to do , he subjects himself to a series of couching that Aoi gives in a form of task that normies would do, even though it was things that Aoi does. At first he likes it when he sees that changes in himself, but for a while there one would have been disgusted when he almost reverted back to his original outcast self, only to realize that he only need to be himself when he establishes a relationship with Kikuchi Fuka, in fact he doesn\'t have to be like Aoi, he only needs to be an extroverted version of himself.Aoi Hinami- She basically has it all, brains, athleticism, influence ,social standing and coming from a higher middle class family, what\'s good about her was that she never abandons Tomaozaki when she realize that the guy she was playing on-line games with would be the out cast loser , Fumiya Tomozaki, rather than just chaste him for destroying her expectation , she help him become a part of that social structure , but in reality she simply tries to make Tomozaki be a version of herself rather than just making Tomaozaki be an extroverted version of himself.Nanami Minami-She basically adds to the drama as somewhat as Aoi\'s competition of being on top of the school\'s hierarchy, but what she is was anther one of Tomozaki\'s classmate that has some for of envy and insecurities.....Shuji Nakamura- Ok, he was one guy whom just like Aoi has everything...almost, except beating a loser like Tomazaki in a game called ""TrackFam"" , now what\'s disgusting about him, was how he waste his time with aloser like Tomaozaki when that\'s what he\'s good at and that he\'s one person would never amount to anything except Shuji himself......Kikuchi Fuka- She may not be anything , but she does provide a ray of sunshine to Tomozaki\'s loser life.....and TBH , the score is for her.Enjoyment: Very Good 8. Unlike rom-com that involves loser guy to top girl this basically takes the cake in it\'s own way, cu\'z it\'s a rom-com that isn\'t a rom-com given the kind of relationship that the guy has for the girl.

Its central narrative is focused on Tomozaki, an incredibly cringeworthy, introverted teenager who has more or less given up on life in general in favor of escapism. This only changes when he one day has an offline meeting with Hinami, an incredibly popular classmate who unbeknownst to him is the second best player in said game and harbors and inferiority complex over the fact she can't seem to beat him. Her immaturity and childishness in losing...to someone as socially inept and as much of a loser as Tomozaki lead to her taking him under her wing in order to reform him to ordinary life, with her using video game lingo in a way to attract his attention.The anime - much like its light novel counterpart - is structured into several semi-episodic arcs, through which Tomozaki helps one of his classmates' issues. This is a fine structure that increases the number of people surrounding Tomozaki, and helps emphasize his good nature in helping people around him as well as how he does so depending on the person he's assisting, bringing out some pretty neat characterization. Yuzu, for example, being more or less a stereotypical maiden in a one-sided love, is reluctant to interact with Tomozaki and only does because of his skill at the game she wants to play to get better at and socialize with to get closer to Nakamura. Her development is about her defrosting around Tomozaki, as well as growing to love the game for what it is - contrasting with Tomozaki, who finds having someone to unironically guide and socialize over the game to assist him greatly in him opening up about him talking about the game with others.Minami - affectionally called Mimimi both in-setting and by the general fanbase - appears to be an absolute disaster of a genki girl, but this betrays someone with an inferiority complex to Hinami, who wants desperately both to be acknowledged by her superior rival as well as improve her self-esteem, as she feels unacknowledged for coming at second place all the time. Her arc wherein she bonds with Tomozaki over similarly wanting to beat down Hinami is where - for many people, both involving the LNs and the anime - the series grows the beard, with Mimimi's infectious charisma and humor surrounding her often stealing the spotlight from every other character.  Her arc is also where it becomes obvious to the audience - as if that wasn't from episode 1 already apparent - of Hinami's major character flaw involving her keeping everyone from a distance and never trusting anyone with her emotions, putting on the air of a perfectionist while putting on airs around everyone else.This leads to the central conflict surrounding the series, involving whether or not it's better to pretend to be someone you're not - as does Hinami for the entire series - or take the jump and wear your heart on your sleeve involving who you are and what you love, as does Tomozaki. The answer the series arrives at is a mixed one; Tomozaki having his own agency, independently of Hinami's advice, is something that the narrative portrays as a good thing and helps him connect better with people who like him exactly for who he is. Fuuka is the best example involving this, pointing out at a point in the show that her interactions with him were more genuine and more down to Earth - even with awkward silences - when he wasn't following a script. At the same time, this is no reason to discard Hinami's advice and her assistance that allowed him to reach where he has in the first place, with the clear indicator that he wants to influence her to be a better and more truthful person in the same way she helped him.The series is carried hard by its excellent cast of characters, who interact with each other - with all the disconnect and drama that ensues - as normal teenagers would. There's a huge emphasis on body psychology and neat camera shots emphasizing characters' emotional states in spite of the series's rather limited budget, with Project No. 9's work being a reminder that despite an average budget at best, they've succeeded greatly in making an adaptation that at once feels spirited despite its limitations. The series looks decent from start to finish, with no serious decline in quality and rather detailed backgrounds, helped by some pretty neat direction.The sound direction is of particular note here; while I wasn't a fan of the OP song, its visuals look pretty neat, and the same can apply to the ED (though that was closer to my kind of tune, helped by the singer changing occasionally depending on the episode). The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, courtesy of Hiromi Mizutani, whose work here easily rivals among his best, even if I do think his work on Non Non Biyori still has the edge overall. Where credit needs to go hardest is towards the voice-acting, with performances by Ai Kayano as Fuuka, Gen Satou as Tomozaki and Hisako Kanemoto as Hinami being all fantastic, especially during more emotive/dramatic scenes in the series. The best performance in my opinion needs to go to relative newcomer Ikumi Hasegawa, for whom her role as Mimimi is a breakout, with her completely selling Mimimi's more hyper and comedic side on one hand as well as her more introspective, self-loathing side on the other. Considering that she had done an even finer job with another anime out this year, I hope to see more of her voice in the immediate future.Bottom-Tier Tomozaki is a pretty excellent series, with a likable as hell main cast, fun premise, interesting (even if overdone) themes and an excellent adaptation of the first three volumes of the source material. While the series will not appeal to everyone, anyone who enjoys stories similar to it would be well-served, and I do hope for a S2 down the line - even if that seems a bit difficult to predict considering the anime's less than stellar sales. If nothing else, the LNs are a fun time and are in a comparatively more secure position considering the LN series's popularity in Japan.Thanks to anyone and everyone for reading my review, any and all feedback would be appreciated. to someone as socially inept and as much of a loser as Tomozaki lead to her taking him under her wing in order to reform him to ordinary life, with her using video game lingo in a way to attract his attention.The anime - much like its light novel counterpart - is structured into several semi-episodic arcs, through which Tomozaki helps one of his classmates' issues.

Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is a boring, uninspired mess. The protagonist is introduced as an antisocial loner who is the number one ranked player at “tackfam” ,or Smash Bros as we know it, and meets his rival who happens to be the perfect girl at his school. She is smart, athletic, popular and the ideal role model for everyone around her but to me she was unbearable. The school has this unwritten rule that popular girls wear neck ties and the unpopular ones wear bow ties which leads me to my main criticism of relatability.Relatability is a key part of...anime and this one did not handle it well which ruined the show for me. The characters introduced, other than the MC, are so “socially perfect” that it eliminated any potential relationship to form between the viewer and the cast. The MC is a total wreck and treats social skills like it’s a Skyrim speech tree, Aoi (the rival) is the one providing these “lessons” and cannot be liked by the viewers as she is too far away from reality; Ironic really as that’s what the premise of the show is. I highly doubt the world created here is anything like the experiences any of us have had which is why it’s so boring.My next gripe is more about a recurring phrase, “this game of life”. I don’t know why but every time This was muttered my skin would crawl, it’s just frustrating to hear as I find the premise of treating the real world like a game cringe-worthy. The show tries to delve into complex themes, similar to Oregairu, but fails due to the nature of them. They treat the real world like you need xp to talk to popular people and if you don’t meet the level requirements you’ll become a laughing stock. This couldn’t be farther from reality as people naturally drift to those with similar interests and hobbies regardless of popularity.I’m going to wrap this up as I’ll be here all day discussing every issue otherwise. The only saving grace is the middle of the show where they focus more on the trips out and less on the game aspect, it feels like they’ve built an average romance story with the typical growth of a boring MC and tried to force the growing popularity of the gaming genre into it. It fails this task and the ending leaves the characters in the same spot as the beginning, “training” the MC into becoming socially acceptable. anime and this one did not handle it well which ruined the show for me.

While it also shows how in society pretty much everyone has a mask on and they pretend to be something perfect. That part helps to relate with the character.And it highlights how someone can change themself and others' perspective about them with small changes.Few scenes where Cringe and the last episode had a lot of dialogue which was important for the plot but was kinda boring to watchI think you should give it a try.

Hopeful you can help me Improve :)."", ""A romance anime that I almost overlook in this season. Quite a surprise since I wasn't expecting to have a good time watching this.The story is simple. Basically, a gamer learns how to raise his stats and get promote to normie level. Nothing unique about it, and it's just your typical guy befriended a popular girl then slowly build his harem (though in this case... is it still harem? maybe). But it is still fun.The characters are... decent, at the very least. They aren't one-dimensional (though some of them are), but they still follow a set archetype. Though there are some exceptions in the show...like Minami.The MC is not a character. He is a self-insert whose only personality is being passionate about games. Like, he has two sides. The virgin side and the gamer side. He is a bit cringe, but look past that and he is pretty decent.The animation and music ost are both decent. The animation is quite stiff, but the art is pretty decent, quite good sometimes. The ost flows decently but there aren't any outstanding tracks in the series.The opening and ending are both great though. Not the greatest this season, but still quite catchy and good.Overall, it's a decent series that you should watch just to pass time.(4.8/10) like Minami.The MC is not a character.

The series dips its toes into deeper ideas about the roles in society and whether they are really beneficial for oneself, but then sidetracks itself to fanservice and bad humor eg. Minami's arc.  While in one scene Tomozaki may be showing the results of his progress by speaking confidently with his head held high, in the next he is shocked and stuttering after being asked a simple question. The theme of self-improvement...is reduced to a vehicle to advance the 'plot', and only used when convinient eg. introducing the romance sub-plot, and dropped when not eg. when the show needs a cheap laugh.Overall despite having an interesting premise with a large target audience, Jaku-Chara manages to become a fairly standard school slice of life with a character that occasionally fits into the associated theme. is reduced to a vehicle to advance the 'plot', and only used when convinient eg. introducing the romance sub-plot, and dropped when not eg. when the show needs a cheap laugh.Overall despite having an interesting premise with a large target audience, Jaku-Chara manages to become a fairly standard school slice of life with a character that occasionally fits into the associated theme."", 'Alrighty then, This would be my first ever review of anything, be it a Game or an Anime.I\'m gonna start off sweet and simple, This anime is good.The amount of redditors and discord moderators who are getting offended left right and center by this anime is far too funny.I for one am a massive weeb and a shut-in, Sunlight for me is something i only see in my dreams or when i go to college.

Its focus on the theme of ""change"" and ""effort"" makes the series and its characters shine so much, choosing to make the most out of its context without relying on much tropes in developing the characters or story. Its humor can sometimes be a hit-or-miss, though, and the seemingly conformist-ish approach of the story may not sit well with some people. Nevertheless, I find great potential in the series going forward.Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki\'s setup of changing one\'s self might remind you of something like ReLIFE. However, the...first few episodes were honestly kind of cringe-y to me, so much so they gave me a lot of secondhand embarrassment and whiplash. Although what made me stay is the cute girls (half-kidding), I like how it doesn\'t drag in its conformist-ish approach to have the main character, Tomozaki, become intent on changing; it goes straight to the point with clear goals, reasons, and situational setups.And, though the lessons Tomozaki learns on socializing may already come off as natural or obvious to some of us, I think I can appreciate the depth and substance of the discussed details. The series really scrutinizes the going\'s of social cues and behavior, and it all manages to make sense even if some degree of cringe in its execution is an inevitable circumstance.Characters are all very likeable too. Even if some may find them ""normie"", they fit the context of the series without being too trope-laden. In fact, speaking of tropes, I love how the main character isn\'t a complete copy-paste of other various unsociable shounen MCs. Tomozaki makes me cringe sometimes, but I love his initiative to be better and it\'s exactly his efforts that make him endearing (and that make me laugh).Further, his personality, as shown in his monologue and dialogue, shows sincerity and meaningfulness, which translates well in his actions regardless of how poor or good the execution is. His actions never go over the top as per usual normal anime/manga/LN antics; I\'d say they\'re pretty grounded in reality! Even then, he has his not-so-boring, defining personality traits, such as in his budding rivalry with his kinda-friend, kinda-mentor in Aoi.For another example: my favorite character, Minami, was actually someone I did not like at all in concept: her background, design (I hate ponytails), and struggles didn\'t resonate with me upon initial reading in Wikipedia.Her confidently popular but kinda struggling with insecurities inside schtick is not anything unique either because it\'s a concept already done, but what made me end up loving her would be dialogue and dynamics. Her conversations with others flesh her out as a friendly (albeit teasing), outgoing, and kinda clingy person just as much as she is perceptive and insightful about her place in the school\'s social hierarchy and overall standing or self-worth, giving her a lot of good depth while making her lovable and incredibly relatable all the same.Despite the ability of the series\' premise to be easily set up as a harem, it doesn\'t choose that direction. Instead, it presents several relationship dynamics, all with interesting chemistry—and they\'re realistic enough that it reminds me of even my own relationships in reality.So, despite my love for the harem genre, I\'m glad the series is just a nice, lighthearted entry to the romcom genre without being too overly complicated or dramatic. Even its simple theme revolving on ""change"" and ""effort"" is aptly put throughout the episodes.Sure, maybe the premise isn\'t as deep as Oregairu (not that I\'d know because I haven\'t watched S3) or as relatable and cunning as Hachiman, but hey, I\'m loving the series for what it is.I give it a 8/10 because of my intense personal enjoyment, though most of my gripes are mostly just personal: I dislike the cringe-y game references and sometimes weird delivery of humor. I don\'t usually factor in music since my ears don\'t really pick them up while watching, but I do feel like this department was pretty bland.It\'s not particularly thought-provoking, and some many not even like the conformist-ish approach of the story. Even then, despite its restricted run of 12 episodes, Tomozaki has been shown to be more than just a mindless drone following the whims and ropes given to him by Aoi: his monologues (despite apparently lacking of the nuance seen in the light novel) and actions show he is still his own person with agency. It is exactly this that helps the story not become a stale series of lectures, but one driven by interesting, round characters and with actual, dynamic substance that leaves you wanting for more.Regardless, I\'d still say to give it a watch/read only if you\'re open to such simplicity (and open-minded enough to bear through some moments that would really give you secondhand embarrassment).All in all, I would go so far as to say I see great potential for the series going forward, especially Tomozaki\'s never-ending potential as a character, be it in a second season or the actual light novels.---Context: I\'d written this review around the end of Episode 6 and the start of Episode 7. It was around that point that I saw the fruits of the premise and that I was feeling the same way as the protagonist; it\'s when I knew that I\'m already legitimately liking it.Although I am posting this as of March 8 (so 9 episodes thus far), I\'m positive my feelings would not change.(P.S.: I really mean it when I say I cringed. There was even a moment that made me go, ""It\'s cringe, but it makes sense."") first few episodes were honestly kind of cringe-y to me, so much so they gave me a lot of secondhand embarrassment and whiplash.

Even then, despite its restricted run of 12 episodes, Tomozaki has been shown to be more than just a mindless drone following the whims and ropes given to him by Aoi: his monologues (despite apparently lacking of the nuance seen in the light novel) and actions show he is still his own person with agency. It is exactly this that helps the story not become a stale series of lectures, but one driven by interesting, round characters and with actual, dynamic substance that leaves you wanting for more.Regardless, I\'d still say to give it a watch/read only if you\'re open to such simplicity (and open-minded enough to bear through some moments that would really give you secondhand embarrassment).All in all, I would go so far as to say I see great potential for the series going forward, especially Tomozaki\'s never-ending potential as a character, be it in a second season or the actual light novels.---Context: I\'d written this review around the end of Episode 6 and the start of Episode 7. It was around that point that I saw the fruits of the premise and that I was feeling the same way as the protagonist; it\'s when I knew that I\'m already legitimately liking it.Although I am posting this as of March 8 (so 9 episodes thus far), I\'m positive my feelings would not change.(P.S.: I really mean it when I say I cringed. There was even a moment that made me go, ""It\'s cringe, but it makes sense."")', ""actually i dropped this anime when i watch the first episode, but i watched again because a random guy appeared on my tiktok and says the mc will having a glow up. the story is interesting for me, no life guy that says the real life sucks and then he's having a development through the episodes. also it encourages me for fixing my appearance & bad postures haha. the art is pretty generic, nothing special. the op and ed is fine, these songs are the type that you must heard it for many times to like it. i really enjoyed this anime, posibbly the best...anime of this season for me. anime of this season for me."", 'I never had the intentions of watching this anime but after i heard it was about gaming, i knew i just had to see what creativity lies in here. Fun or not, gaming is what you will hear the most in episodes, should you watch it that is....too annoying even but i will explain that more detailed as we go through.So we meet Fumiya Tomozaki, a lowlife who spends his days playing Smash...so much that he\'s the number 1 player in Japan. After one match with the number 2, the two of them decide to meet and...its one of the girls in his class. Normally,...she gets embarassed and pretty dissapointed that he was the number 1..so she decides to help him get better in life after COMPLETELY saying she was terrified of him...where does this make sense? No matter; now our ""hero"" with the helpful tips from Hinami Aoi(his classmate), is trying to be a somebody and try to ""beat"" this game called life. Essencially, this is an educating anime for those who probably feel like this..but honestly this is an insult. They make this situation look too easy like as ""you do this and that\'s it, you\'re the best""...its not always like that you know? Lots of people struggle with this shut-in problem, some feel terrified about opinions on what other people might have on them and others perhaps had some experiences in life that, unfortunately, led them be like that...but this anime throws that fact out of the window by using its ""facts and logic""(""you do this and that\'s it, you\'re the best""). The problem with this anime is that it gets decent...on the last episodes.I get it, this anime most likely will have more seasons as we go but that glimpse of what\'s to come only shows very rarely; clearly Tomozaki is growing to be a better person but those scenes show up very rarely in the anime and gives more focus to other character\'s problems..hasn\'t our MC suffered enough in his life?  I don\'t think he would be capable of understanding other people\'s issues when he can\'t even fix his(if he ever had issues either way). If the trend from episode 11 continues, perhaps this turns out to be a good show afterall.Characters are too uninspired. There\'s tons of girls and yet not a single one where i can be satisfied with; either they don\'t have screentime or they just talk nonsense that doesn\'t interest anyone. Regarding Tomozaki more, often you will see him say ""I suck at this game of life.""; ""I want to become a better player at this."" ; ""Her level is too high..."", can\'t they tone down with the gaming talk...its making this anime more cringy every time i watch it(biased opinion, you can discount that from this review.)Art is pretty dissapointing, sure it looks alright but they cut perhaps the best scenes that the manga had and replaced them with generic boring normal things...this is where all the ""gaming"" content could have been presented like in the manga. Animation is quite decent, nothing out of the regular. Music is nothing special too, the opening and the ending sound quite upbeat but other than that, its as generic as it could be.So should you watch this anime? Frankly, depends how the second season goes or how the story in the manga is because i can\'t recommend this at all. The best compliment that i can give to this anime is that the voice acting is quite good but other than that, better stick to the manga; its not a huge step up but its a better experience than what you see from this animation.

Dissapointing.', ""(English is not my native language, i'm sorry if i make grammar mistakes)So as many of the reviews are saying this anime is kinda cringe in his first episode. Because of that i wasn't expecting anything good from this anime. But, Oh boy, let me tell you that i really enjoyed watching it.First at all, the story as most of animes doesn't get finished, so if you want to continue it probably you are gonna have to read the novel of the mangas, idk if they are planning to make a season 2.With that out the way, i must say that this anime has a...great character development, not only main character,  we can see minor changes and ways of thinking in the other relevant characters to the story.The plot is very appealing, at least in my case. I found a number of situations that were very close to me, cause i saw myself in way similar ones too. To wacth how the main character realized that pretty much he isn't a victim and that socials relationship depends mostly on him was a situation that i lived too so that's why this anime hit me so hard.I really would recommend this anime, just only take in mind that it isn't as focused in romance as you would think, it mainly focus on social relationships. great character development, not only main character,  we can see minor changes and ways of thinking in the other relevant characters to the story.The plot is very appealing, at least in my case.

He\'s an arrogant high-school student who disdains the rules of society without intentionally breaking them. He dresses poorly, doesn\'t style his hair, slouches over, and can barely hold a conversation with classmates. That makes him the ideal protagonist for an anime that understands the rules of high-school romantic comedies—and it knows how to break them. An arrogant, but earnest, speech introduces Tomozaki.""Life is a god-tier game… But from where I stand, that\'s bullshit. You get discriminated against or...treated poorly for your face, your build, your age. All these absurd rules go unchallenged. Unreasonable and unbalanced. That\'s what life is. \'That\'s only because you\'re not trying!\' Biased thinking from someone born as a top-tier character. Some noob gamer born lucky enough to enjoy blazing through life on easy mode doesn\'t get to talk about life.""""The game of life is garbage.""When I read this, I cringed out of my skin, and I assumed Tomozaki would be another annoying self-centered anime protagonist who\'d get everything he wanted with no effort. Things didn\'t quite go the way I expected. Everyone goes through a phase in life where you feel like the world has wronged you. And that\'s because it has. People born into a family with high income will have a much easier life than someone born into poverty—the world is unfair, and that\'s a fact. Tomozaki mistakenly believes he was born in an unfortunate situation. He selfishly assumed he was the only kid in his high school who has been created by society. But as his newfound rival Hinami says, ""You lost, and you\'re blaming the game."" She takes it upon herself to train him to become better at the game of life, which involves fixing his shitty personality.There\'s a precise goal of Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki-kun: Turn a self-centered loser into an average joe, and I loved to watch it unfold. Tomozaki doesn\'t fit in with other high school students. No one understands him. He has trouble making friends in the real world, so he ends up spending most of his time playing games. It\'s not all bad though, he enjoys honing his skills and fighting his in-game rival. But there\'s more to life.At first glance, it may seem like the story reaffirms Tomozaki\'s weird way of judging people—like your typical harem fantasy isekai—but his quick judgments get proven wrong. Though he acts like he\'s just telling it like it is, he\'s an outcast because of his quick judgment. He believes he can see through everyone\'s actions, and they\'re the problem—like a sociologist. The truth is, he\'s the problem. Hinami believes the key to his success is by teaching him strategies to fool people into liking him. Same as Tomozaki, she thinks she is the most intelligent person in the room. One of Hinami\'s challenges that will raise Tomozaki\'s statistics is to publicly embarrass the \'cool guys\' in his class. AKA, being an asshole and saying things like:""Your dick is tiny!""*cue laughter*It would’ve been funny if I hadn’t heard these jokes in middle school. The comedy is hit or miss, but there’s more success in terms of the characters. Through Hinami’s games, the author explores mistakes kids make when attempting to fit in. Every time Hinami gives Tomozaki instructions on the next \'level\' of the game, he seems uncomfortable. He remarks how dating a girl to increase his social status doesn\'t feel sincere. I liked seeing Tomozaki slowly realize his mistakes. Hinami\'s complicated personality unravels as Tomozaki becomes more self-aware. She\'s the closest thing the anime has to a villain. Seeing him try, fail, and eventually succeed entertains her in an almost sadistic way. She orders him to have better posture, practice smiling, and even get a girlfriend of her choosing. These are supposed to make him a better member of society—and objectively some of her advice is helpful, but other times it is outright manipulative. Though you may interpret her lessons as the author\'s message, he does not condone Hinami\'s antagonistic behavior. Their cat-and-mouse relationship is more frustrating than exciting because the pay-off comes far too late. The author has the workings of a great story in his hands, but he lacks the tools to craft it.Hinami idolized Tomozaki because he\'s a talented player in her favorite game, but she also looks down on him for failing at the game of life. He can\'t dress himself properly; his hair looks like a mess, his posture is terrible. Everything she says about him is absolutely valid—though she says it is a cruel and demeaning way. Rather than trying to inspire him, she more often seems like she wants to put him down. She\'s frustrated that he can\'t do simple tasks to fit in and instead blames society because she knows it\'s hard, yet she put in the effort to fit in. She experiences a kind of schadenfreude when witnessing Tomozaki\'s failures. When Tomozaki breaks the rules of her game and confronts her with the truth that she\'s unhappy with her fake personality, it makes raw and believable moments. I wish these scenes weren\'t limited to the final act.This is Tomozaki-kun at its best—when it isn\'t afraid to be down-to-earth. The script alternates between genuinely witty touches and standard rom-com dialogue with drama woven in. Weighing down the script the most is the \'gamer lingo.\' If you see the word ""Noob"" or ""Normie"" and feel compelled to claw your eyes out, I don\'t blame you, but you won’t like this show. The dialogue sometimes feels like it was written by someone\'s out-of-touch dad trying to talk to his kids. Without the great voice performances on the part of the two leads, it would\'ve lost me. The show\'s production enhances the script\'s delivery overall. The character designs are good. The artists nail certain facial expressions and subtle changes, but overall there isn\'t much animation. Most of the show takes place in similar locations: A classroom, a cafe, a sidewalk, and stores. There\'s no need for spectacular animation because it\'s all talking and monologuing. I\'m sure that will be an instant turn-off for some people. The sound design is much more appreciable. Songs aren\'t faded into each other—they stop and start at pivotal moments. The songs are decent; both the OP and ED are good.Bottom-tier Character often straddles the line between condoning or condemning Tomozaki\'s bizarre behavior. But more often than not, it falls on the \'condemning\' side. He monologues in a logical manner, psychoanalyzing his classmates\' behavior. One of his creepiest lines was commenting on a mutual friend who arrives a little late to a meetup; he says, ""This ditzy act absolves you of a myriad of sins."" Dude, she was like 5 seconds late. No one wants to hang out with someone who psychoanalyzes everything they do. That\'s why Tomozaki is at his happiest when he deviates from Hinami\'s rules—and the rules of the rom-com genre.Hinami compares their female classmates to heroines in a dating simulator—you go out on dates with a love interest. It\'s dehumanizing but expected of her personality. Then after enough successful interactions, they become your girlfriend. Tomozaki adopts this dating sim method because Hinami told him to—it shouldn\'t work because real people are nothing like shallow characters in a game. Luckily, the author realized this and subverted the script. Rather than getting the girl with his gamer strategies, he throws them out the windows and just acts like himself. It works. Genuine people don\'t like fakers, and that\'s what Tomozaki is about. Between the wit and fanservice, the characters scarcely have room to breathe. Luckily, they were sure to spare at least half an episode to delve into each of the troubled side characters: Feelings of inadequacy, troublesome romance, or struggles to fit in. Tomozaki takes the time to get to know everyone while attempting to raise his stats. He comes to realize everyone has a tough life, even more than him, and that he isn\'t unique.Unfortunately, the excessive fan service makes the subversive character writing feel somewhat phony. Thigh shots, unnecessary nudity, leering panning shots, and the girls grope each other for the audience\'s entertainment. One could argue there are\' story reasons\' for why there is so much sexualization, but let\'s be honest, folks. This is a product, and it needs to make money, regardless if it undermines the show\'s themes.Mimimi is an excellent example of a side character with a compelling story, undermined by fetishization. She is one of Tomozaki\'s potential love interests and a friend of Hinami, the object of her inferiority complex. However, she has a knack for sexually harassing her friend Tama. The show plainly tells us her story, ""Her feelings for Hinami—a mix of gratitude, respect, and envy—have mellowed out a bit thanks to Tama. Though Mimimi\'s sexual harassment seems to have increased threefold."" The first part is solid character writing; however, the second part isn\'t. Mimimi acknowledges what she does is harmful to an extent, yet she continues to do it. Even after her character arc completes, the happy ending feels undeserved. Unlike Tomozaki, she never realizes that she\'s creepy and works to improve it. This probably won\'t be a problem for everyone, but it was for me.Eventually, Tomozaki surpasses Hinami in the proverbial game of life once he realizes there is no game. Life is what it is, and attempting to climb an invisible social ladder won\'t make you a happier person. I recognize Tomozaki-kun is made for people five years younger than me, but I still enjoyed it. For that reason, recommend it to anyone around 16 years old. It\'s not a challenging show to watch if you\'re familiar with subversive romantic comedies; It is comfortable. Though it is far from perfect, it tells a universally relevant message: Be yourself. treated poorly for your face, your build, your age. All these absurd rules go unchallenged.

So sit back, copy my review & paste it onto Google Translate because I would feel less guilty if you don\'t spend too much effort into reading my review that way...Do note that I am going to be VERY very thorough with the explanations.[Story] : (7/10)Like the synopsis says, Fumiya Tomozaki is the best player of the online game ""Tackfam"" and one day, the 2nd best player decides to meet him in...real life.He\'s your typical shut-in and with all of his problems, Aoi Hinami, the 2nd best player, feeling appalled chooses to help him with his social life.He & her agrees on the approach to life like a god-tier game. As in, the context of difficulty and perks.At first, I immediately knew that this was going to be a hard story to write.Human interactions? Social skills? Timing? Interpersonal? --Actually, just humans in general. To keep the audiences attention or to make it painfully obvious enough is a really difficult task.People can blindly dislike something for whatever reason and we can\'t do anything about that. So the presentation has to be solid enough to garner enough attention span.Anyway, the prologue sounds mundane to many, but the director or the author did a good job honestly.The plot is actually interesting. Guiding someone and helping them to achieve things-- it\'s not your typical ""MC helps characters out."" It does come with character development and the process is thoroughly executed.The thing that makes this series interesting is that it does spark some loopholes in the character\'s decisions. It\'s not plot holes, but I guess you can call it hidden motives or layered intentions. One does not simply act without an objective in mind and that is not made apparent.I don\'t know about other viewers. But for me, Aoi Hinami, the main character, makes me actively observe her like a real person with consequential intent. But then again, this is an anime character we\'re talking about. So I\'m just basically analyzing and studying the author\'s writing...What the author really pulled off is to inflict opposition onto the viewers.""She\'s doing something that I don\'t agree with."" ""Okay, something is off.""Raising flags at a steady pace while progressing the story.This series really does make you want to look into more about the characters. But it might not be something that you would like, and I\'ll get to that in a bit.[Art] : (9/10)I really like the art. I don\'t have much to complain other than small details that should\'ve been handled well. But Art shouldn\'t really matter much as to the story unless it affects it.Though you\'ll see how well they drew the protagonist as the story progresses.Additionally, I really like the eyecatchers of this series. They blend in anime art with real life photography!You can check this forum out that I made to see how well it looks : https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1902993[Sound] : (8/10)The music is nice. I like the OP and the ED.I guess you could say that the soundtracks aren\'t as memorable. But really, I payed more attention to the story than the music despite being a music nerd myself (I\'m an actual musician btw).It\'s most likely because I watched the series in one go, and then I stopped after a few episodes, then I continue it again in a total of 3 times. Which should mean that I watched 4 episodes on average.. but it\'s more like this : 2 episodes this day, 4 episodes after a month, 3 episodes after another month, and so on.The music is not bad, don\'t get me wrong.

So this must be interesting given that I gave this series a 7/10.This series is enjoyable and it made me realize that I should look into other psychological studies.I usually based it off of cognitive functions, or MBTI in general (you can look it up if you want). But if that doesn\'t add-up, I would look at other things. Yet, it still made me question myself of what and how much I know about ""humans"" or ""psychology.""I\'m no psychologist, but stating that my personality being a matured INFJ could mean something.That is, if you know what I\'m talking about... Essentially, INFJs are known for their emotional intelligence.Manipulation, puppet-master, social engineering...... but with good intentions.In case you\'re wondering who my favorite character from the series is, it\'s Minami.She has the most character depth out of all with a dedicated arc for her. And, I feel her.. I really know how she feels.Other than that, I have no idea how Takei has more favorites on MyAnimeList than both Minami & Fuuka-- they\'re supporting characters, but they\'re also the girls that the protagonist gets to choose from![Overall] : (8/10)To summarize it, this is a series is interesting if you\'re into how humans interact, socialize, interpersonal, or just psychology in general.If you\'re here for the plot more than the characters, then this might not be for you because the author makes it obvious that this is about them.Lastly, I somehow managed to write a review without spoiling anything. Props to me, yay...Thank you for reading my review! real life.He\'s your typical shut-in and with all of his problems, Aoi Hinami, the 2nd best player, feeling appalled chooses to help him with his social life.He & her agrees on the approach to life like a god-tier game. As in, the context of difficulty and perks.At first, I immediately knew that this was going to be a hard story to write.Human interactions? Social skills? Timing? Interpersonal? --Actually, just humans in general. To keep the audiences attention or to make it painfully obvious enough is a really difficult task.People can blindly dislike something for whatever reason and we can\'t do anything about that. So the presentation has to be solid enough to garner enough attention span.Anyway, the prologue sounds mundane to many, but the director or the author did a good job honestly.The plot is actually interesting. Guiding someone and helping them to achieve things-- it\'s not your typical ""MC helps characters out."" It does come with character development and the process is thoroughly executed.The thing that makes this series interesting is that it does spark some loopholes in the character\'s decisions. It\'s not plot holes, but I guess you can call it hidden motives or layered intentions. One does not simply act without an objective in mind and that is not made apparent.I don\'t know about other viewers. But for me, Aoi Hinami, the main character, makes me actively observe her like a real person with consequential intent. But then again, this is an anime character we\'re talking about. So I\'m just basically analyzing and studying the author\'s writing...What the author really pulled off is to inflict opposition onto the viewers.""She\'s doing something that I don\'t agree with."" ""Okay, something is off.""Raising flags at a steady pace while progressing the story.This series really does make you want to look into more about the characters. But it might not be something that you would like, and I\'ll get to that in a bit.[Art] : (9/10)I really like the art. I don\'t have much to complain other than small details that should\'ve been handled well. But Art shouldn\'t really matter much as to the story unless it affects it.Though you\'ll see how well they drew the protagonist as the story progresses.Additionally, I really like the eyecatchers of this series. They blend in anime art with real life photography!You can check this forum out that I made to see how well it looks : https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1902993[Sound] : (8/10)The music is nice. I like the OP and the ED.I guess you could say that the soundtracks aren\'t as memorable. But really, I payed more attention to the story than the music despite being a music nerd myself (I\'m an actual musician btw).It\'s most likely because I watched the series in one go, and then I stopped after a few episodes, then I continue it again in a total of 3 times. Which should mean that I watched 4 episodes on average.. but it\'s more like this : 2 episodes this day, 4 episodes after a month, 3 episodes after another month, and so on.The music is not bad, don\'t get me wrong.

Props to me, yay...Thank you for reading my review!', ""Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun (2021)Well, what can we say about this one. It sort of feels like we achieved so much and nothing at all but at the same time I am glad to have seen this.The story in many places is really strong but in others, it just sort of stops making sense as you can tell it has been skipping about. For example, Tomozaki and Kikuchi have a much deeper relationship than you see for the most part.On the subject of Fuuka Kikuchi, she is the best girl and her maid outfit was to die for. I must say if only real girls...could pull off white hair but we all sadly know that is a tall order.The art of the show is very good most of the time. Parts of it sort of don't meet the same standard. Eyes are done gorgeously as well as all of the girls overall too. You can see where effort was put into the background too.The OP and ED are great. The OP is really good fun to listen to and gets you singing along. Generally, other sounds are pretty standard for a slice of life style show.Characters do develop very well but also as said sort of have sudden bonds you didn't really notice before as it skips about. I would say mostly it is very fluid and nice to see.I would say in the end it is a very good show that is a definite watch. It is compared to SNAFU a bit which I can see but it is nowhere as developed like that. Perhaps this serves as a good entry-level show for deep-set dramas that is more comedic.8/10. OVA to come and maybe a second season who knows. could pull off white hair but we all sadly know that is a tall order.The art of the show is very good most of the time.

OVA to come and maybe a second season who knows."", 'Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun had, in my opinion, a terrible first episode. The first episode was full of cringey dialogue and questionable ideals. It also had a fairly mediocre, cringey final episode. But everything in between was actually pretty competent and enjoyable.I want to start this review by stating that I had issues with the ""lesson"" the anime seemed to be trying to teach. I was on board with Tomozaki every time he complained that something seemed dishonest or scummy, because those things were fairly dishonest and scummy. At first it seems that Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is trying to tell the audience that the only reason you are...struggling in life is because you don\'t try hard enough and that no one has any inherent leg up on anyone else, but it ended up being an anime about being true to yourself and following your own desires. I didn\'t completely agree with the points it was trying to make at all times but I appreciated what it was trying to do in the end.My biggest issue with this anime was Hinami. She is constantly labeled as caring and perfect but she\'s sort of a sociopath. She has no connection to anything around her because she constantly has a mask up and everything she does is so she can ""win"" at life. It\'s rather pathetic, yet Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun never implies it to be as such. The final episode is dedicated somewhat to Tomozaki trying to convince Hinami that people do have things they desire and that life isn\'t just a big contest to see who can win. Life is about having fun and doing what you want. Hinami, of course, brushes this off stating there is no proof that personal desires exist... which is just ridiculous. Hinami through the entire anime teaches Tomozaki how to be more presentable and how to be less socially awkward but she also comes across as incredibly two-faced and unlikable. She wants Tomozaki to confess to Fuuka even though he doesn\'t even know if he likes her. Hinami says it doesn\'t matter since Fuuka likes him so it would be selfish to ignore her feelings. What?Mizusawa has a similar personality to Hinami (always having a mask up) but he comes across as much more genuine and he comes out and clearly stats that he is sick of being that way and wants to change. He knows it is wrong to try to be with someone you don\'t even like. He personally confronts Hinami about her ""mask"" and she just wears another mask to pretend to agree with him. He of course sees through this but she sees nothing wrong with her own actions. It\'s not as if we get any deep story about Hinami explaining why she is like this, she\'s just a weirdo who thinks life is a big game that she needs to win and doesn\'t really care about personal feelings... even though it does seem she genuinely likes her friends you can never be sure if this is true or not.Hinami wasn\'t the worst character ever I just had my issues with her. Her personality is never fully explained or given a reason so it\'s hard to feel for her. Everyone else was either pretty good to great. Of note Fuuka was very cute, Mimimi was interesting, and Tomozaki himself was very likeable.I don\'t have any other major complaints but I had my fair share of issues with this anime. Overall it was a pleasant watch and much better than the horrible, cringey first episode.7/10 struggling in life is because you don\'t try hard enough and that no one has any inherent leg up on anyone else, but it ended up being an anime about being true to yourself and following your own desires.

I know that the context can be boring or even cringe in a first contact, although this thoght never come to me, since i was being in the side of the protagonist in the whole time, i never feel so represented in a media before. Like, i loved when him use the term ""normie"" and talks about the social life as some impossible to get, because for many years and even now a little bit, i have some social problems that i really wanted some person like the Hinami for help...me. The animation shows a side of relathionship that was never talking about, and the great development of the caracthers its rare to see. Like we can see others animes with anti social protagonists of sure, but i don\'t remember any of they that decide to change for a life better and that was improving his skills. I\'m kinda feel in loving for the protagonist because of that, i can\'t express how much we are alike. Even the way that he act can be cringe for some people but for me is so much me that i can\'t judge. Well, we can see here a harem but so much unusual. It\'s so small fanservices in the animation that i was surprised, it can atract others peoples that don\'t like much ecchi or some like this. And the relantioships are more realistic, like the protagonist is not popular with girls, he can make friends with her easily but is no girls fighting each other. Has some girls that are liking more his friend than anything, and thats other thing that enriches the work. I\'ts have some guys handsomes too, and better, the protagonist is friend of they. Better, has moments importants of the history about they, and they are well buit. The characters are so real, with his own defects that was being showed in the story. I confess that are some episodes that are more so so, and without context, like for example the Mimimi episodes, i really dont care about her, because we have here a great protagonist, that put other person in front of him is a abuse. Overall, i love the scenes of comedy, that are well balanced, and some reflections. The two last episodes for me was a masterpiece, especially the end. All the discussion take so much explosions in my mind, that no other anime will never discuss the relationships like that way. me.

It's all presented pretty realistically in my opinion from...experience in that it takes time, and tomozaki getting there is fun to watch with a funny and diverse supporting cast, there's no handholding for him all the characters are blunt about their true feelings and not everything works in the moment which is refreshing from a lot of harem type stories.The beginning is pretty brutal however and there are some extreme moments of cringe that make you want to look away and turn off the show from embarrassment but given the plot its expected and is handled as such, he isn't glorified for being cringe its part of something he needs to overcome which I think is good. experience in that it takes time, and tomozaki getting there is fun to watch with a funny and diverse supporting cast, there's no handholding for him all the characters are blunt about their true feelings and not everything works in the moment which is refreshing from a lot of harem type stories.The beginning is pretty brutal however and there are some extreme moments of cringe that make you want to look away and turn off the show from embarrassment but given the plot its expected and is handled as such, he isn't glorified for being cringe its part of something he needs to overcome which I think is good."", 'I cant stand people saying that this anime is bad. Especially for the reasons why. I would go as far to say that this anime is one of the BEST game anime we have seen in a long time, and now that the anime is over, and the previous reviews giving it the respect it deserves are now preliminary, only 1 in 10 reviewers seems to be giving it the credit it deserves.The story is by far the weakest part of the show, which is what people are taking at face value, and giving the anime a bad review. The story isnt the point of...the show. The anime is about all the other aspects. The characters (Which they do as good as/better than Horimiya imo), the scenery, the music. They are all meant to encapsulate living an enjoyful life. Which is why  when you stop looking at the anime at face value, you start to see the real thought and genius that goes into the show. The fact that the top 2 players in takfam are coincidently in the same school are rendered completely irrelevant within the first 2 episodes, because the show isnt about leveling up at a game, its about leveling up at life. It was the fact that a fellow takfam player was trying to help Tomozaki, and not a normie, that he actually decided to give it a shot.A lot of people claim that the show is ""cringe"" or that the main character looks like a ""hentai protag"". These people are missing the goddamn point. A game anime doesnt have to just be about playing games. It can also be about being a gameR. This is meant to depict the lifestyle of high schoolers who plays smash bros and from the beginning, ITS BANG ON. From the snide remarks to how smash players actually converse with eachother. How the game is seen in the protags eyes, how gamers look at video games. The way he cares about takfam like a lot of smash players are passionate about smash. Its all done to a tee. A lot of smash players are cringy, and some actually are popular (Ive seen it with my own eyes) so its not unrealistic at all.The art and music arent that great when you look at the anime at face value, which most of the people reviewing the anime are. But when you look at the anime from a bigger picture, the art and music accompanies the way Tomozaki approaches life throughout the show. This is shown especially in episode 11 where  he asks himself the really important questions and his character fully develops.Yes, the guy looks like a ""hentai protag"", but really thats only at the beginning of the show.  I know a few people who play smash and their hair and clothes looks pretty much the same as the MC. Its unbelievable how accurate his clothes were compared to people ive met irl. The whole anime is a message to gamers, specifically smash players. The more he becomes a member of society, the more subtle changes in himself he notices. This anime has the best character development in any game anime ive ever seen.Its not like he goes from shut in neet to freaking kirito in 4 eps. Its also not like hes just doing whatever Aoi tells him to do, in fact, multiple times me has gone against her judgement and came out a better man. The way the MC defended his classmate as he was getting mentally attacked by a female student was so on point to how someone who loves smash would react. He himself acknowledged that he doesnt need Aoi\'s help as much as he used to, and came to the conclusion that her way of thinking was flawed. He decided to try and take on the challenge called life and now that hes trying, he doesnt think its trash anymore. the show. The anime is about all the other aspects.

What I mean by that is that it’s okay to cringe at Tomozaki, the main character of this show. It’s okay to cringe because that’s the point of the show: our boy goes from a cringe sad boy to a cringe chad boy and boy is it glorious. It’s okay to cringe at his “gamer” dialogue with Hinami as well. These are high schoolers we’re talking about. And they’re not just any highschoolers, they’re highschoolers who are really into their intellectual property’s legally distinct version of Super Smash Bros....As a “video games playing guy” myself who spent his senior year in high school playing Smash Ultimate with the boys every lunch period without fail, let me tell you, people like us act and say things in a “cringe” way sometimes. And that’s okay. If we come across a story that sets out to depict “cringe gamers” and how they perceive the world, can we honestly say that cringing at the result is a failure on its part? Not at all. If anything that’s a failure on the viewer’s part to meet the story halfway, to realize what it’s aiming for and to judge it based on that. Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is at its heart a dramedy, which is a stuffed up way to say it’s a comedy with some character drama. The main conflict between the leads Tomozaki and Hinami introduced in the first few episodes comes to a head in the show’s conclusion predictably but still satisfactorily. From here I intend to spell out this conflict, what I found to be the most interesting parts of the show, so if you’re just looking for a recommendation suffice it to say that the main charm of this story is as the synopsis says: the self-betterment of an endearingly awkward gamer boy. The fish out of water comedy that results from this betterment is what drives the laughs and occasional reflective “hmms” this show will get out of you. If I had to compare it to another popular anime, it’s what you get when you take Oregairu, subtract most of the angsty monologues and multiply the parts where the protagonist actually tries to improve himself all while adding in some “cringe” gamer jokes (that are supposed to be cringe; that’s the point guys). Enjoy!Who is Aoi Hinami? Why, she’s a high-tier character is the game of life of course. Someone who’s learned all the high-level tech to befriend the world. Someone who knows all the frame data to counter any awkward conversation and set it back on track. Someone who has mastered various classes like “class president”, “school athlete”, and “top of the class student”. Someone who we later find out goes to such lengths only because she sees them as productive behaviours that most people aspire to. And it’s because these are common aspirations, (being athletic, academic, and a social butterfly), that she wants to be the best at them, believing that she has no personal desires of what she “really wants to do” motivating her. Wait, what? But putting that worrying cognitive dissonance aside for now, when it comes to “Smash Bros” of all things there’s one opponent she can’t beat: her classmate Fumiya Tomozaki. But while Hinami is proficient in many things, Tomozaki is proficient in just this one thing. He’s also quite the social pariah at school who has given up on all hope for social life. Feeling a kinship with Tomozaki’s drive to improve himself at this one thing, Hinami takes him under her wing and teaches him the “best” strats for grinding experience points to level up in the real world… Okay, I think you get it, so I’ll stop poorly imitating the “gamer” dialogue of the show now. But my use of airquotes around “best” did have a point, and it’s that Hinami’s idea of self-betterment is problematic. Of course, she doesn’t have it all wrong. For example, teaching Tomozaki correct posture. It’s uncomfortable at first, but it’s nothing but beneficial for his mental, physical and social health in the long run. It’s the same with instructing him to start more conversations with others. With telling him to be more assertive in conversations so that he doesn’t end up the butt of the joke all the time. With ordering him to lie to this quiet girl in his class about sharing her interests so he can ask her out and fulfill some arbitrary goal of getting a girlfriend before he graduates. Wait, what? And there lies the problem. Hinami is realistic about gaming success in life and in socializing to an almost cynical degree.Through the lessons she gives Tomozaki, Hinami is actually attempting to quantify social interactions and relationships in a utilitarian-esc model of capital: what am I gaining from this? And what she seems to be getting at through this way of life is perfection in a boring, inoffensively stereotypical way. Tomozaki even describes her as a typical “yamato nadeshiko” in episode one. In context he means this as a compliment, but since the term comes from the pre-modern Japanese ideal of a woman who is demure, faithful and virtuous, all of which are terms set up by men (observers of women, akin to players of a game), Hinami’s pursuit of happi- I mean pursuit of “perfection” is thrown into relief as fake and forced. She acknowledges this fakeness, however, and proudly touts it as the point of life: overcoming one’s self to become better. But what does “better” mean to her? I wrote earlier that she’s trying to be perfect in a “stereotypically inoffensive way”, but that doesn’t quite fit, as she’s more striving to just be better than the rest. This reflects back to her and Tomozaki’s relationship. Both of them hate to lose, and so they treat life as just a competitive game until Tomozaki grows a brain (or rather a heart). The main thematic conflict of this show arises when Tomozaki starts to disagree with Hinami’s advice, particularly involving his relationship with Kikuchi, and starts to act of his own accord in his relationships. After following her orders for quite a while and improving himself in her terms of what “better” is, Tomozaki confronts Hinami about her over-calculating approach to life. He thinks, like I hope most of us do, that choosing what you “really want” is more important in life than coldly calculating what the arbitrarily “best” option is. She disagrees without giving a good reason (more on this later). The show ends on an inconclusive note. The final episode takes the setup in episode one where Hinami challenges Tomozaki to the game of life and reverses it so that he challenges her to see whether his new-found resolve to pursue what he really wants in life, however irrational, can beat out her cold and uncompromising rationality. While these competing schools of thought aren’t explored as much as I would have liked by the end, the ending manages to be a heartwarming showcase of just how much our awkward gamer boy has grown. In the end he uses the skills his mentor taught him against her: he is assertive and stands up for himself. Considering that this is an adaptation of a light novel, I didn’t expect for there to be any real conclusion after twelves episodes, but what we got works well as a culmination of the major themes: self-improvement, what motivates self-improvement, and what is a healthy way to go about this self-improvement. My hope is that the light novels continue to explore why Hinami betters herself seemingly only for the sake of it. What does becoming the stereotype of the perfect person, the yamato nadeshiko, do to a person? The answer to that shouldn’t be hard to guess, but seeing as the story has set up all these questions in advance, I’m confident it will deliver on them well with a good mix of light character drama and goofy gamer talk (which is funny because it’s cringe, not in spite of it; guys I’m telling you, please listen to me here. The cringy gamer stuff is the best part. Yes this is the hill I’m dying on).The production of this show is nothing remarkable. The sound effects blended in well and the music set the tone of scenes well. The voice acting, especially for the two leads, was enjoyable. It would have been easy for Tomozaki’s VA to start stuttering less and speaking more confidently right away, and so his more gradual transition from sad mode to chad mode was much appreciated. But seriously, every time Tomozaki said “ゲーマー” (Gamer) or ”ゲーマーとして” (As a Gamer) I lost it. He’s a clumsy guy who sees things in terms of games, what can you do? It’s the point of his character, so I say just try to laugh along and wish him good luck. His story of self-improvement while staying true to himself is a simple one, but it’s told well and is a net positive to anime as a whole. Tomozaki is an aspirational character, and I wouldn’t mind tuning in to an OVA or a second season to see where his aspirations take him next.

The anime is about a boy who is just playing this one game all the time. Then he find out, that girl from his school also play this game. But they have opposite personalities so she start to teach him ""how to live life"". And thats it. Nothing speacial and the graphic is nothing spectacular or something.Story have some progress for like 5 episodes. There is literally zero...sound and the characters are boring af. sound and the characters are boring af.', 'Overall, I was expecting some generic incel/gamer justification as to why life is unfair. I was pleasantly surprised that this show did not have any of that. Towards the beginning, the protagonist is a bit pathetic and lives a delusional lifestyle. They believe their life is unable to be improved upon just because of the cards they were dealt when they were born. They do try to justify this mindset at the start, but it\'s necessary to do so and it doesn\'t go to an annoying extent. Pretty quickly, they begin thinking much more optimistically and attempting to improve upon themselves with help and encouragement...from others.If you find yourself at a tough spot in your life, you may relate to the main character and their attempts to live a better, more fulfilling life. I would recommend it because of the tone of self-improvement that this show creates. It\'s one of the few rom-coms I was able to sit through as someone who has seen them all. The show has its flaws, but it\'s an honest attempt at bettering one\'s self.Side note: the show makes a lot of comparisons between life and video games, some of them hit while a lot of them miss. Be prepared for a whole lot of references to ""Attack Family,"" which is the main video game the show revolves around. Think of it as the show\'s equivalent of Super Smash Bros. from others.If you find yourself at a tough spot in your life, you may relate to the main character and their attempts to live a better, more fulfilling life.

My working hypothesis is that the gaming focus narrowed the potential audience quite a bit, and so many other great shows came out in the season that it got lost in the shuffle. It also relies a lot on “cringe” moments as part of the humor, but to me that is just part of the show’s charm. It also makes sense given the context of how the protagonist is presented in the beginning of the show. Personally, this was my 2nd favorite show for the season behind only Attack on Titan and is the only new...show from the last few years that I re-watched just for enjoyment. I even decided to read ahead in the light novels, which I haven’t done for any other LN adaptation.Before I go into more details on the show itself allow me a brief divergence into the genre of romantic comedies.While romcoms have existed dating back to Shakespeare with Much Ado About Nothing and A Midsummer Night's Dream, for modern anime purposes they truly took off after the success of Rumiko Takahashi’s seminal work, Urusei Yatsura. Once that series made it big, and Lum became the first ever major waifu figure, many of the subsequent series in the genre have emulated certain aspects of Urusei Yatsura.Loser/loner main character? CheckHarem/multiple love interests? CheckBeautiful waifu(s)? CheckI could go on and on with this list, but you get my point. I bring this up because romantic comedies have largely converged into 3 main categories since then and they stem from Urusei Yatsura’s influence.First, the “destined pair”, in which there are no serious competitors for the love of the “destined pair”. Second the “love polygon”, usually with a love triangle involving 2 (sometimes more) females competing for 1 male (obviously, Shojo will invert this to 2 or more males to 1 female). Finally, the “harem”, in which the creator says, “Fuck it, why not just give our Chad protagonist all the bitches?”. These 3 categories are all distinct in their style, but all 3 categories borrow from some aspects of Urusei Yatsura. Virtually every single romantic comedy in anime will fall into 1 of these 3 categories. I bring all of this up because Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki doesn’t neatly fall into any of these categories (it is correctly listed under drama, but the author refers to it as a romantic comedy). If I had to pick 1 it would have to be “love polygon”, but it is fitting a square peg into a round hole. This is a good thing, because the series is doing something outside of the usual formula for romantic comedies that inserts a random loser/loner protagonist with random character quirk X to magically end up dating the most beautiful/popular girl(s) in school like most series. This isn’t your usual self-insert escapist BS. Instead, we get a real character drama that examines the nature of relationships between people in society and the way we present ourselves to different people depending on the person and situation. With all of that out of the way, let’s dive into the series itself.Story/Plot 10The premise of the story is unique in that the main character’s “quirk” is that he is a great gamer and the best online player of the most popular fighting game in Japan, Attack Families (Super Smash Brothers), so the series treats his growth as “leveling up” and creates gaming metaphors to match the scenarios he finds himself in throughout the story. I don’t think you need to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy this aspect of the series, but if for some reason you hate video games, or get constantly annoyed with the gaming metaphors, this isn’t the series for you. For most non-gamer viewers, they may find the occasional video game jargon used off-putting, but for the most part the series does a good job of explaining the jargon, so the viewer understands what the characters are referring to. As a gamer myself, I enjoyed this aspect of the show and only a casual understanding of video games is likely needed to improve the viewer’s experience.The story follows the protagonist, Fumiya Tomozaki, as he starts his journey towards self-improvement in the “game of life”. In the beginning, he laments how “unbalanced” (unfair) the game of life is compared to his favorite game, Attack Families (nicknamed Tackfam), that he considers a god-tier game. He thinks the game of life is a trash tier game and doesn’t believe it is worth it to focus his energy on it in the same way he does for Tackfam, which he believes is the perfect game, a game that anyone can enjoy ranging from a casual setting all the way up to professional level play. The show does an excellent job of contrasting how he makes excuses for not making any effort in life with how Nakamura makes excuses for losing at Tackfam to him in the very beginning of the show. Nakamura blames his loss on using a bad character, in a bad matchup, in a bad game (with unfair rules). Tomozaki admonishes him for blaming the game for his loss, telling him that blaming the game when you lose after making no effort is shameful. He offers to switch characters with him to prove his point, then quickly wins again. After meeting the school idol, Aoi Hinami, secretly the 2nd best player in online Tackfam, NO NAME, at an offline meetup, he realizes the cognitive dissonance between his excuses compared to Nakamura, and with some cajoling from the gamer he most respects in Japan besides himself, decides that it is worth making a real effort at life as he does with Tackfam, to see if it is truly the god-tier game she claims it is. After that decision, the rest of the show features Tomozaki being walked through the game of life by Hinami through the use of tasks that mimic what people use in real life to achieve their goals, as she teaches him all the rules of life that make it a god-tier game, based on her own efforts she used to improve herself into the “top tier character” she is currently.It was refreshing to find an anime that doesn’t coddle the usual antisocial behavior you find in loner/loser protagonists in anime, especially Isekai. Those types of shows offer their viewers an escape from the frustrations of adolescence by blaming everything else but themselves for their situation. Telling them that were it not for excuses A, B, and C, that they too would be popular, good looking, smart, dating the most beautiful girl at school, etc. just like the self-inserted protagonist they project themselves to be. While every person has their own obstacles towards reaching self-fulfillment, with some people having larger obstacles than others, everybody can make changes to their circumstances to get closer to leading a fuller life. That is the overarching message of this story, and it is a great one to pass along to its audience.Art/Animation 6The character designs themselves are gorgeous and stand out in the series. Unfortunately, the production quality drops off in the last 3rd of the show, with some scenes quite literally looking unfinished. It is as if the producers had run out of time/budget towards the end and told the animators to just push out whatever they could manage in the end. This is a sad commentary on the broader anime industry, but that’s a whole other can of worms. The overall production quality is mostly fine, but since the show is a character driven drama the focus is mostly on making the characters look good and their dialogue. The show does a good job of expressing the emotions of the characters through their facial reactions and tone, which is important given how much focus is on the dialogue of the characters.Sound 7The opening is a catchy upbeat pop song “Jinsei Easy?” from DIALOGUE+, a female Japanese idol group, that reinforces the larger message through its lyrics by encouraging the listener to do their best with some gaming metaphors mixed in. The sound within the episodes themselves is mostly average. There are a few scenes where the sound elevates itself for the moment, but you are largely getting stock tracks for certain types of scenes. The ending is Ayafuwa Asterisk, also by DIALOGUE+, that is understandably more mellow than the opening, but still an upbeat sounding track overall. The lyrics focus on the oftentimes aimless and confusing feelings of adolescence. Certain episodes have the ED sung by the voice actresses for the female character that was/is the focus of that arc instead of DIALOGUE+. That was a very nice touch to add some variety to the ED and also highlight the VAs too. If you enjoy a particular Japanese VA this gives you a reason to tune in to the ED that they recorded! I thought both the English and Japanese VAs did a good job with each character, with Ai Kayano being of note for her performance as Fuuka. I usually only watch anime with subtitles, but the English translation for the dub was well done, and the English VAs made listening to the dub as enjoyable as the Japanese VAs did for the subs.Characters 10The level of character development and depth the series manages in only 12 episodes is remarkable for a school drama/romcom. The supporting characters are real people, not just the tropes you usually get. You learn about some of their hopes and fears as Tomozaki slowly becomes more involved in their lives from both his own initiative as well as Aoi’s tasks. As Tomozaki progresses through his development during the show he gains more agency with the direction of his growth. He understands how inauthentic it is to take an interest in someone from an assigned task as opposed to his own desire to genuinely learn about them. He refuses to let misunderstandings form the basis of a relationship, realizes that being his authentic self is the best way to connect with someone, and increasingly pushes back when Hinami’s tasks conflict with his own morals.There are also 2 potential negative issues for viewers with the main characters that I want to mention. First is how incredibly awkward Tomozaki’s character starts off as. His level of ineptness in social interactions borders on unbelievable, to the point of potentially turning off a viewer. This didn’t bother me, because he starts off just short of a total shut in and he improves over time, but it requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief. The other 1 is the character of Hinami herself. Between how she views relationships, as if they are simply tasks to be completed, to her incredible level of excellence in everything she does, her character can also be viewed as unrealistic too. Almost too perfect at everything to be real. While her views on relationships gets addressed as part of the growth of the protagonist, this can still serve as a turnoff to the viewer. I will say that from my own experience that I have known someone that was similar to Tomozaki in college and to Hinami in middle school. In fact, in a lot of ways they were even more extreme than the characters themselves. The guy I knew in college almost flunked out because he didn’t go to class while playing World of Warcraft all the time. The girl I knew in middle school was so exceptional, I was not even remotely surprised to learn she not only attended Harvard, but was the commencement speaker for her graduating class. While these are extreme examples, they demonstrate the possibility of the characters in the story existing in real life.Enjoyment 10As I mentioned previously, I have already re-watched this series once and read ahead in the light novels based off of my enjoyment of the anime. The premise is unique and well-executed. The story breaks the mold of typical school dramas/romcoms. The characters are interesting and receive proper development. While it has some flaws in production quality, particularly in the last 3rd of the show, it didn’t hinder my overall enjoyment of the anime. If you enjoy serious character dramas, light hearted romantic comedies, or are intrigued by the premise, I encourage you to give this show a try.Thank you for reading. show from the last few years that I re-watched just for enjoyment.

He thinks the game of life is a trash tier game and doesn’t believe it is worth it to focus his energy on it in the same way he does for Tackfam, which he believes is the perfect game, a game that anyone can enjoy ranging from a casual setting all the way up to professional level play. The show does an excellent job of contrasting how he makes excuses for not making any effort in life with how Nakamura makes excuses for losing at Tackfam to him in the very beginning of the show. Nakamura blames his loss on using a bad character, in a bad matchup, in a bad game (with unfair rules). Tomozaki admonishes him for blaming the game for his loss, telling him that blaming the game when you lose after making no effort is shameful. He offers to switch characters with him to prove his point, then quickly wins again. After meeting the school idol, Aoi Hinami, secretly the 2nd best player in online Tackfam, NO NAME, at an offline meetup, he realizes the cognitive dissonance between his excuses compared to Nakamura, and with some cajoling from the gamer he most respects in Japan besides himself, decides that it is worth making a real effort at life as he does with Tackfam, to see if it is truly the god-tier game she claims it is. After that decision, the rest of the show features Tomozaki being walked through the game of life by Hinami through the use of tasks that mimic what people use in real life to achieve their goals, as she teaches him all the rules of life that make it a god-tier game, based on her own efforts she used to improve herself into the “top tier character” she is currently.It was refreshing to find an anime that doesn’t coddle the usual antisocial behavior you find in loner/loser protagonists in anime, especially Isekai. Those types of shows offer their viewers an escape from the frustrations of adolescence by blaming everything else but themselves for their situation. Telling them that were it not for excuses A, B, and C, that they too would be popular, good looking, smart, dating the most beautiful girl at school, etc. just like the self-inserted protagonist they project themselves to be. While every person has their own obstacles towards reaching self-fulfillment, with some people having larger obstacles than others, everybody can make changes to their circumstances to get closer to leading a fuller life. That is the overarching message of this story, and it is a great one to pass along to its audience.Art/Animation 6The character designs themselves are gorgeous and stand out in the series. Unfortunately, the production quality drops off in the last 3rd of the show, with some scenes quite literally looking unfinished. It is as if the producers had run out of time/budget towards the end and told the animators to just push out whatever they could manage in the end. This is a sad commentary on the broader anime industry, but that’s a whole other can of worms. The overall production quality is mostly fine, but since the show is a character driven drama the focus is mostly on making the characters look good and their dialogue. The show does a good job of expressing the emotions of the characters through their facial reactions and tone, which is important given how much focus is on the dialogue of the characters.Sound 7The opening is a catchy upbeat pop song “Jinsei Easy?” from DIALOGUE+, a female Japanese idol group, that reinforces the larger message through its lyrics by encouraging the listener to do their best with some gaming metaphors mixed in. The sound within the episodes themselves is mostly average. There are a few scenes where the sound elevates itself for the moment, but you are largely getting stock tracks for certain types of scenes. The ending is Ayafuwa Asterisk, also by DIALOGUE+, that is understandably more mellow than the opening, but still an upbeat sounding track overall. The lyrics focus on the oftentimes aimless and confusing feelings of adolescence. Certain episodes have the ED sung by the voice actresses for the female character that was/is the focus of that arc instead of DIALOGUE+. That was a very nice touch to add some variety to the ED and also highlight the VAs too. If you enjoy a particular Japanese VA this gives you a reason to tune in to the ED that they recorded! I thought both the English and Japanese VAs did a good job with each character, with Ai Kayano being of note for her performance as Fuuka. I usually only watch anime with subtitles, but the English translation for the dub was well done, and the English VAs made listening to the dub as enjoyable as the Japanese VAs did for the subs.Characters 10The level of character development and depth the series manages in only 12 episodes is remarkable for a school drama/romcom. The supporting characters are real people, not just the tropes you usually get. You learn about some of their hopes and fears as Tomozaki slowly becomes more involved in their lives from both his own initiative as well as Aoi’s tasks. As Tomozaki progresses through his development during the show he gains more agency with the direction of his growth. He understands how inauthentic it is to take an interest in someone from an assigned task as opposed to his own desire to genuinely learn about them. He refuses to let misunderstandings form the basis of a relationship, realizes that being his authentic self is the best way to connect with someone, and increasingly pushes back when Hinami’s tasks conflict with his own morals.There are also 2 potential negative issues for viewers with the main characters that I want to mention. First is how incredibly awkward Tomozaki’s character starts off as. His level of ineptness in social interactions borders on unbelievable, to the point of potentially turning off a viewer. This didn’t bother me, because he starts off just short of a total shut in and he improves over time, but it requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief. The other 1 is the character of Hinami herself. Between how she views relationships, as if they are simply tasks to be completed, to her incredible level of excellence in everything she does, her character can also be viewed as unrealistic too. Almost too perfect at everything to be real. While her views on relationships gets addressed as part of the growth of the protagonist, this can still serve as a turnoff to the viewer. I will say that from my own experience that I have known someone that was similar to Tomozaki in college and to Hinami in middle school. In fact, in a lot of ways they were even more extreme than the characters themselves. The guy I knew in college almost flunked out because he didn’t go to class while playing World of Warcraft all the time. The girl I knew in middle school was so exceptional, I was not even remotely surprised to learn she not only attended Harvard, but was the commencement speaker for her graduating class. While these are extreme examples, they demonstrate the possibility of the characters in the story existing in real life.Enjoyment 10As I mentioned previously, I have already re-watched this series once and read ahead in the light novels based off of my enjoyment of the anime. The premise is unique and well-executed. The story breaks the mold of typical school dramas/romcoms. The characters are interesting and receive proper development. While it has some flaws in production quality, particularly in the last 3rd of the show, it didn’t hinder my overall enjoyment of the anime. If you enjoy serious character dramas, light hearted romantic comedies, or are intrigued by the premise, I encourage you to give this show a try.Thank you for reading."", ""There is a fine line between wholesome and cringe, and this anime is the latter..I watched this show because I really enjoyed The Angel Nextdoor Spoils Me Rotten, which was a very wholesome show, and among that shows' recommendations someone suggested this show, unfortunately as it turns out, these 2 shows are absolutely nothing alike.This show is basically just one big long unlicensed ad for super smash bros brawl, along with a really dumb guide on how to fix social anxieties, as written by a true oblivious boomer.Granted, I am currently only 4 episodes in, and am yet to start the 5th (against my better...judgement), so it's possible I might change my mind and thus this review later in time, however I have a sneaky suspicion that I will not.If this show was AI generated, I would believe it.Edit: I've finished the show, including the OVA's, nothing changed judgement), so it's possible I might change my mind and thus this review later in time, however I have a sneaky suspicion that I will not.If this show was AI generated, I would believe it.Edit: I've finished the show, including the OVA's, nothing changed"", ""TL;DR: A power fantasy for a smash frog.Imagine you're in high school.Imagine you love super smash bros.Now imagine the coolest guy in school challenges you to smash bros. and all of the hot girls are watching as you 4 stock him repeatedly.Now imagine the cool guys ex-girlfriend calls you guys cringe for being obsessed with a Nintendo game and then you have a literal trigger warning spasm go off in your brain and you start (not exaggerating) screaming and screeching at her about how she's wrong and that this is the best game of all time then all of the hot girls decide to be...your friend.Don't worry, you don't have to imagine it anymore, because this show does exactly that.If that's still somehow not your dream self-insert as a smash player don't worry, there's more.

I didn\'t want to corrupt my high-quality anime palate with unworthy shows, however, admittingly I am a sucker for romance. Before being able to play the video my fingers trembled in expectation of the ""cringe-worthy"" experience I was promised having read some of the earlier reviews on this show. But to my surprise, this show was greatly underrated, now don\'t get me wrong I am not saying this show is life-changing or trend-setting, what I am saying is if we...were to get more shows of this quality then this world would be a much better place. On to the actual review.While this show was without a doubt ""cringe."" Something that even I wouldn\'t dare try to deny. From the attitude of the main protagonist to the ""life is a game"" driven plot, there is without a sliver of a doubt that this show is cringey. What makes it an underrated show is the way they decided to write out the story. I am a firm believer of the way you write a story is the most important part of a piece of cinema, to further explain this, I believe that having a well thought out plot is extremely important, but having a good basis to write isn\'t everything, you could have a plot full of cliches and washed out ideas and still make it a cinematic masterpiece if you write it correctly, take the isekai genre for example, it\'s a genre that I think most of us can agree is WAY overused, tons and tons of worthless animes are being produced every season and it\'s just full of the same repetitive cliches, human from Japan (or from wherever) gets hit by almighty truck-kun and is immediately transported to a world of big titty waifus who are all boring and whos personalities are all stored within their tits, they are shallow characters and whose entire life is now dependant on this random nobody from Japan who was reincarnated to be overpowered as fuck!!!!!! and to make it all worst the main character is just as 2 dimensional!!!!, however, we\'ve all seen it haven\'t we? Once in a blue moon there comes an isekai story that comes all the way out from left field and leaves us stunned such as: The first season of RE:Zero, or a more recent anime Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu both of which if you haven\'t seen I highly recommend. Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun did just that while it wasn\'t mind-blowingly good, the way they write the story was done so grandeously well, while it\'s cringe seeing the main character yell things along the lines of ""life is a game and don\'t diss my favorite pass time!"" if you can get passed the butt-clenching cringeness, then yeah, he\'s making some damn good sense and getting a realistic reaction out of what he\'s saying. The plot was full of cliches but it was very well-executed. The heroines were not at all shallow, there is genuine character development of the main casts, it doesn\'t just run the whole main character is everything, or main heroine is everything plotline. It shows true conflict and real resolution. It doesn\'t just present an obstacle that is seemingly difficult and then make its resolution to be surprisingly easy, there is real conflict that makes sense, there are tiny details of each and every character to show that they are real people with real struggles. I cannot stress it enough that it is not just running a mysterious main character who rules everything scenario, it\'s truly a main character that is full of bad and must toil and dig up all of the few good qualities that he may or may not have and battle against overwhelming odds and coming up with realistic solutions and genuinely growing.WE NEED more animes of this quality, in a world of shitty cliches and shallow waifus, I cannot let this underrated show sit in a pile of bad reviews simply because the concept of the story is ""cringey."" I normally agree with the ratings MAL gives to anime shows, but I cannot believe the fan base is against this show right now. The wise people of My Anime List, how are we letting this happen??? We of the high-quality palate in animes, should know that this show does not deserve its currect 7.23 rating, now while I disagree in saying it deserves a rating of 8 stars+, I truly and desperately believe it deserves at least a 7.7.

It also has the added bonus of making me more self-aware of when I actively push away other people and opportunities just because I want to be left alone, which in its own right is enough to make this anime more than special for me. It had really been an enjoyable show that I looked forward to every week, and it made me care about the characters in a way I wasn\'t really expecting from this sort of show. That being said, I am quite disappointed at how...they ended the show and it has really ruined all the good things I thought about it. On the last episode, barring from the restaurant scene with Kikuchi, all the other conversations were unnatural and the themes were blatant. It was almost like they were afraid the viewers were too stupid to get the underlying message so they shoved it down their throats. I would\'ve given this show an 8 or 9 but that ending was just horribly executed. It felt like the characters became a representation of their themes and became nothing more than vessels of what the writer was trying to preach. It took away the realness that these characters had in their subtle interactions and just really left a bad taste in my mouth that frankly ruined the whole show for me. I will still give the show a 7 nonetheless, I can\'t just forget about the good parts that this show had even if they were hardly present in the last episode.Overall, good show, life-changing lessons, ruined by a horribly executed ending. they ended the show and it has really ruined all the good things I thought about it.

Even if in reality it’s just a “so bad, it’s good”, there’s more thought put into Tomozaki’s characterization and development than most other mediocre comedies, kudos.Everything else, between story, art and sound is mediocre. They’re all serviceable aspects for an average comedy anime. The biggest compliment I can give Jaku-Chara is if...anime were scored on how many laughs they’ve received, it’d be the highest anime of all time from just me.In reality, It’s a 4/10 show, which delivers 10/10 enjoyment, so Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is a solid 7/10 on average! anime were scored on how many laughs they’ve received, it’d be the highest anime of all time from just me.In reality, It’s a 4/10 show, which delivers 10/10 enjoyment, so Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun is a solid 7/10 on average!', ""I'll be honest, I nearly dropped this show about half way through but it really picks up by the time you get to the end and I did enjoy it so I thought I'd give it a review. Will I ever get better at starting reviews? Probably not.Story: 6/10.For most of the show, I really didn't feel like there was any story at all. For the first half, it just felt like disjointed episodes that had no connection to one another. It was kind of like a tv cartoon where each episode is basically standalone. However, it kind of picked up a little during the...second half and it led to a somewhat satisfying ending. However, I don't feel like I can rate it above a six though because of the lack of story during the first half.Art: 9/10.The art style for this show is really pretty!

It's really catchy and it's been stuck in my head for... basically the whole time I was watching the show. The use of music overall in this show is pretty good. It compliments the vibe of the show.Character: 9/10.Considering romance shows are mostly character driven (from what I've seen, I don't really watch much romance anime) I was expecting the characters to be good and I wasn't disappointed. Each of the characters is unique and interesting and, best of all, they all seem as if they could be real people that can be found in any high school. That being said, most of the characters didn't have any development. Off the top of my head, the only two characters who received any kind of development were the protagonist and one of the supporting girls (who I won't name for spoiler reasons). Overall, the characters are pretty good.Enjoyment: 5/10.If I'm being honest, I struggled to get through this show. As I said before, I almost dropped it at around the half way mark but I didn't. It often felt like I was five minutes away from the episode when, in reality, I'd only been watching it for around three minutes. This wasn't because I'd seen enough to satisfy me for an episode, it just dragged. They say that time flies when you're having fun and this was the opposite of that. Up until, like, episode eight, watching this show felt like an absolute chore.

I didn\'t say deserve, there were quite a few anime that were better than Tomozaki-kun, but by the end of this anime, what I saw was a potential to be quite the talk when it comes to the romcom anime sphere, if not the general anime sphere.This season has been one that sets up our main characters and the general idea of the anime. Tomozaki, god-like player in both Not-Smash Bros and competitive racism is an outcast who\'s been living in a society. Comes in his biggest...fan girl, noname, who\'s name is Hinami Aoi who\'s mad someone can be more racist than her (or maybe something to do with Not-Smash Bros idk) while being such a friendless piece of a sad existence.So far so good, or not that much so for the first 10 episodes which have been following a rather similar formula. Aoi gives Tomozaki his dailies which are usually accomplished, cringe follows, the day is done, rince and repeat.And then episode 11 hits and the anime takes itself a step above expectations, doing criticism of current relationships through the eyes of someone who just joined it. Playing with the limits of the ""life is a game"" mentality that it seemingly endorsed at the beginning of the anime and flipped the relationship between Tomozaki and Hinami on its head to be more similar to what you see during the Not-Smash Bros. game.But, this only happens at episode 11, which means this anime is a step above and beyond the rest of your romcoms for a grand total of 2 episodes. Which is why I hope for a second season sooner rather than later. Until then I don\'t have it in me to give this anime more than a 7.As for the characters, I did mention our main gamer and his rival and mentor, but an anime would be rather boring with only 2 characters in its main cast. We have a fair cast, a good 7 characters (can\'t be bothered to actually count) all with their own strengths and insecurities that make them actual full characters rather than walking tropes, and get slowly explored throughout the duration of the anime. Their designs are kinda cute while also feeling rather different from the standard anime style and they behave like actual high schoolers instead of middle schoolers you can legally have sex with.All in all, Tomozaki-kun isn\'t much about the ride but more about a satisfying conclusion that has made the pain of the first 10 episodes worth it and that has kept me wanting more. Please get a season 2 soon, it would be nice. fan girl, noname, who\'s name is Hinami Aoi who\'s mad someone can be more racist than her (or maybe something to do with Not-Smash Bros idk) while being such a friendless piece of a sad existence.So far so good, or not that much so for the first 10 episodes which have been following a rather similar formula.

Please get a season 2 soon, it would be nice.', 'I started the show weeks ago with episode 1, laughing at how the dialogue made me physically cringe with my other friends watching the show in the same time, and a rant on how high school setting shows are all basically the same nowadays save for a few. I finished the show an hour ago putting this in the ""save for a few"" bin.I don\'t like essays so I\'m trying to keep this short and sweet, and spoiler free! Let\'s get the bad things out of the way first.The animation is the definition of ""bare minimum"". There are no moments where I got distracted from...the show by jarring animation, and in the same time there are no moments where I thought that the show looked above average as well. The pure mediocrity of the animation almost stinks, but it is passable.The BGM cuts in at odd moments, and themselves are either painfully generic or just takes away from the scene because it sounded awful.The dialogues still make me cringe at times. Like I get it, you\'re a gamer. At one point in his character evolution I expected him to tone down on the gamer-lingo a little but I guess he remains a ""REAL GAMER"" to the end.Story-wise however, it had one of the most fluid and natural progression I\'ve seen in a while. At no point did I feel that the show was progressing way too quickly, but perhaps an arc did take a bit too long to resolve, better slow than fast though.The characters evolve in a very realistic fashion and never really acted out of character, all of them acted for reasons that fit with their character and any changes in their character reflects in the changes in their actions. The conflicts seen in this show are not one-sided ""bad guy thinks bad"" and ""good guy thinks good"", you can see that both parties in conflicts have their reason to believe that they are right, it isn\'t a black-and-white affair seen in many other shows where the author is basically begging you to hate the antagonist.If you are someone that just made it past the first episode and thought: ""FUCK, this is some cringe shit. I can\'t stand this show if it goes on like this."" Then I must say that the cringe is the part of the ride, the cringe is a part of the character that Tomozaki is, and the cringe in him is what drives the show forward. It is a show about a cringe-gamer trying to better himself and open himself up to connections, he has to start somewhere low! the show by jarring animation, and in the same time there are no moments where I thought that the show looked above average as well. The pure mediocrity of the animation almost stinks, but it is passable.The BGM cuts in at odd moments, and themselves are either painfully generic or just takes away from the scene because it sounded awful.The dialogues still make me cringe at times. Like I get it, you\'re a gamer. At one point in his character evolution I expected him to tone down on the gamer-lingo a little but I guess he remains a ""REAL GAMER"" to the end.Story-wise however, it had one of the most fluid and natural progression I\'ve seen in a while. At no point did I feel that the show was progressing way too quickly, but perhaps an arc did take a bit too long to resolve, better slow than fast though.The characters evolve in a very realistic fashion and never really acted out of character, all of them acted for reasons that fit with their character and any changes in their character reflects in the changes in their actions. The conflicts seen in this show are not one-sided ""bad guy thinks bad"" and ""good guy thinks good"", you can see that both parties in conflicts have their reason to believe that they are right, it isn\'t a black-and-white affair seen in many other shows where the author is basically begging you to hate the antagonist.If you are someone that just made it past the first episode and thought: ""FUCK, this is some cringe shit. I can\'t stand this show if it goes on like this."" Then I must say that the cringe is the part of the ride, the cringe is a part of the character that Tomozaki is, and the cringe in him is what drives the show forward. It is a show about a cringe-gamer trying to better himself and open himself up to connections, he has to start somewhere low!', 'This show was an absolute conundrum. The start was almost atrocious, and knew many people who dropped after a couple episodes, but in a fashion similar to Tomozaki\'s development, the adaptation of Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun does a complete 180 in terms of quality, story, character development, enjoyment, and even animation to an extent.In terms of animation, this show suffers from a pretty lackluster studio (Project No. 9). There are many appearances of awkward anatomy, weird eye placement, confusing perspectives, and shoddy animation. However considering how low the budget for this series must\'ve been, it was surprising to see some scenes being animated to a decent standard...(Especially the fanservice).The soundtrack is generic at worst, enjoyable at best. However the opening is an absolute banger, and practically delivered itself in a silver platter to my Spotify playlist.The story is where it gets weird. In the start, the show portrays itself as a ""epic gamer guy is a total loser IRL and literal \'perfect\' chick shows up and helps him"". A very bad look, nevertheless. Cringe moments everywhere that only some extreme weeb could somewhat enjoy. Tomozaki is shown to be a boring character attempting to rip off somebody like Hachiman. The morality of the plot is brought into question as the ""perfect"" chick forces Tomozaki to do things he doesn\'t even understand, or might not want to. However, it is impressive how throughout the story, the problems of the quality of the story start to be resolved, and to an extent you can discover as to why such decisions in the story making were taken in earlier episodes. The series ends discussing the morality of the plotline, multiple character developments with side-characters receiving a decent amount of attention, and Tomozaki himself developing into one of the most unique characters I\'ve seen in quite a while. The comedy is decent, and attempts to be original (Was never expecting a dick size joke in something like this), and the romance is great (Never too much of a focus, but enough to see character relationships progress)If you do not like to stick around through bad episodes to get to the good stuff, this show might not be good for you, but I believe it\'s one of the better seasonal anime\'s we had in a while (Much better than something like the previous season) so if you enjoy the genre, you will most likely end up satisfied with watching the story. The LN seems like the superior way to experience this, to nobody\'s surprise. (Especially the fanservice).The soundtrack is generic at worst, enjoyable at best.

All because I’m a bottom-tier character.”Seeing as this show flew under most people’s radar, I thought I’d write a review with hopes of giving it a little more attention than it received.Let’s get this straight off the bat— it’s not amazing. But it’s not as bad as some others make it out to be, and I think going in with the right expectation is really important if you want to enjoy this show.First of all, there are some major plot points you need to wrap your head around. The main character...is Japan’s #1 Tackfam player (this anime’s equivalent to Smash) and he finds out the #2 player who he’s been competing against the whole time is a pretty and popular girl who goes to his school. That introduction alone should raise a ton of red flags for anyone, myself included. At this point, between the “Drama, Romance” tag and Project No.9’s track record with light novel rom-com adaptations as a whole, most people would expect some kind of annoying, competitive romance between two people who’d never exist in real life abundant with drama-inducing harem side characters as teased by the cover art. But when you take a step back and look at it, it’s not really a romance at all but rather a study on social groups and situations.Of course, there’s no way you’d know that going in.Anyway, let’s say you weren’t bothered by that and gave the first few episodes a chance. There are still some hurdles regarding the premise you need to jump over: Why do they make so many weird analogies between games and life? Why does this guy feel so compelled to fit in with the popular kids? Why are there absolutely no like-minded, introverted gamers in his school he could make friends with? And why is she so obsessed with making him “good enough at the game of life” for him to score a girlfriend? These types of talking points make this show really easy to attack and could quite possibly sabotage your entire opinion of it.But let’s just say, hypothetically, that Tomozaki is *actually* the only otaku in the entire world, and that he truly wants to break out of his shell and get along with these “popular kids” who should want nothing to do with him. If you can live with that, then I think this is where the show starts becoming enjoyable.Initially, this show caught me off guard was when Tomozaki tried talking to a girl who sat next to him in class for the first time:“Um… sorry, Izumi— got a second?”“Hmm? What is it?”“Er… do you have a tissue? I’ve got a cold, but I forgot to bring any.”“Oh, sure. Hang on.”From this excerpt of text alone, it’s hard to tell what’s stands out about this scene. Then, I realized that the thing that made it special was precisely the fact that it was so ordinary, so routine. No dirty looks. No kimochi warui’s. Just two classmates talking to each other. Through this kind of subtlety is where the anime truly shows what it’s made of.It betrayed my expectation of the stereotypes it built up so highly and hit me with the “damn, this is what happens when you actually talk to people in high school”. As a biased, introverted gamer myself, you could call me out for being so unwarrantedly taken aback by two humans conversing and that there are way better anime I’ve never seen which do the same thing. And to you, I concede that point. But if you could relate to me or Tomozaki at all, you might realize that the dark cloud that loomed over your high school days and prevented you from talking to other people never existed at all, and that most people are actually quite nice when you talk to them. You could accept that though it’s not a completely original idea, the anime and author are providing their own personal yet entertaining perspectives on it, and that’s honestly all you could ask for from most shows these days.The characters are not outstandingly cringe and are quite well-written for how much screen time they have. Just because you can see only one side of them doesn’t necessarily mean they are that shallow a person. It’s a common theme which the story surfs the line of pretty well. The animation is nice and colorful but not too detailed, and it helps set the tone of the show as enjoyable and light-hearted, though it does feel a little bit off when they try to be serious. The voice acting is exceptional and, when combined with the script, make the characters more comparable to real people than most other shows. (Except for maybe Tomozaki himself, who feels a bit awkward during the delivery of certain lines, but take that with a grain of salt because that’s technically the goal of his character in the first place.) The sounds are pretty standard and a bit repetitive which doesn’t matter all that much, although I will give DIALOGUE+ a shoutout for making another breakthrough with their hit OP/ED.In conclusion, if you can acknowledge its flaws while appreciating its strengths, I think this show is definitely good enough to give a chance. Like myself, you probably won’t regret it.Thanks for reading to the end. is Japan’s #1 Tackfam player (this anime’s equivalent to Smash) and he finds out the #2 player who he’s been competing against the whole time is a pretty and popular girl who goes to his school.

To be honest it  portrays the devlopment of a ""socially awkward"" student  in a most logical way. I will skip any type of spoilers and write down my experience. I really recommend it to every one who is aroud 17 y/o.The Anime started with a total ""socially awkward"" mc which many people didn\'t like.  But through out the story he starts to grow and what I like the most is that it was natural and the methods are true. It seems a bit rushed though....Animation and sound quality is decent and appropriate for the plot. The characters are the main thing of it and they are likeable. There is also some romance, have to wait to see where it goes . Over all I enjoyed it alot while it was airing.After that I decided to check the LN and as always it was more detailed and impactful. But after reading it ( still reading it ) I can say it can definately shed some lite on someone who is  falling behind. If you like slow stories it can be a fun book to read.Like every other anime not every one will like it.

Then I\'ve watched the first episode and kinda let my hopes down. Yeah, you\'ve read it right ""kinda let my hopes DOWN"".First impression? Well it\'s plain. TOOOOO PLAAAAAIN. But remember, the title of the anime is ""Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki-kun"". ""Bottom-Tier"". This is the main point. It really makes sense why the plot and the starting story of episode 1 is plain and kinda gloomy and this type...of atmosphere goes on in the next episodes too (but not all).Why is it a good anime?You\'ll probably know if you watch it but let me give you ONE reason WHY you should watch this anime.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. This is its strongest appeal to viewers (well this goes for me). It is not fast paced anime unlike any others where MC\'s change after meeting a girl. It takes steps. Slow steps per episode or per scene and for me it is the one key point that makes this anime good. You can feel the THRILL (because it takes steps little by little for the MC to achieve his goal) , ENJOYMENT (in every episode) and the feeling that you want the MC to strive more and go for a change an see what happens next.As the series progress, I am really enjoying it and not noticing that I am smiling while watching the next episodes of this anime. i really can\'t wait for the character development of the MC this anime will show us. It is really the selling point of this anime.EDIT: To be honest, for me the show is going well until episode 11 but right now after watching the final episode of Bottom Tier Tomozaki-kun, I was kind of disappointed. I REPEAT this is only my opinion! Well the final episode doesn\'t give me the conclusion that I want for the show for this season. It lacks the romance stuff for the MC i just don\'t like it. I\'m a little bit disappointed because the final episode only revolves about a certain idea until the ending.But it is  still a good show.

Comparing to Hachiman Hikigaya (protagonist, OreGairu), who can also be considered anti-social and a loner, this protagonists failed to grab my interest at all.Storyline: Rating 6/10The Story could've been much better (talking up to Ep 4), I personally started watching this anime because I thought it might be...related to gaming in someway, I thought it must be about a gaming tournament, where this loner must form a team (something like Kono Oto Tomare), but NO!

It starts up with a guy that most highschool loners can probably relate to. And starts his development by introducing us to a character that we wish we would also knew in our lives.I honestly expected this show to be a ultra standard highschool harem anime again but no. The show is intriguing, it is able to sympathize the audience with the characters and feel emotions with the characters. In the first few episodes and lesser throughout...the series there are a lot of cringy and awkward scenes. This is to say that the main character has no development at all and will sooner start trying to do so.It also had the potential to be the anime featured on a waifu wars for winter 2021, although due to the female characters having pretty dull personalities and base designs compared to other shows (particularly mushoku tensei) it didn't. Not saying they are extremely dull but compared to shows right now, it just failed. It may have been built for realism, but building an anime based on realism is really hard and does have big drawbacks.Now to the question, Is the show good or nah?Honestly the show gets its execution pretty spot on. It takes the audience into consideration and thus is built to do so. I was more intrigued for the show more than I enjoyed it. I would definitely say that Tomozaki-kun himself would be bottom-tier but the show itself would be put high mid-tier on my list.I would recommend this to viewers who wants to find something intriguing but not particularly scientific. something that would touch realism.

I found the characters to be quite cringy and boring. The titular Tomozaki-kun is written to be cynical and wary of others\' actions, which I think is a fine trait to have, albeit a bit dry and overdone. However, his (and many others\') usage of ""gamer terminology"" throughout the anime made me cringe all the way back to middle school, where people acted like using these terms would make them cooler. Many of the lines feel forced and beat the dead horse of ""life is the...shittiest game out there"".

Mainly because I enjoy character focused rather than plot focused series, and this is quite literally “character development- the anime”. However, there were a few pretty big issues in this series.The good:Let me start off by stating: The whole “glow up” nature of this show is fun as hell. It’s like the anime equivalent of those makeover shows you see on TV, combined with the typical slice of life Highschool setting. I also enjoyed most of the female characters, especially mimimi and Izumi. The animation was decent enough for this type of show and the excellent voice acting...definitely carried the show on its back. I also believe in the main message the series tries to convey namely that “life isn’t a game about winning or losing, it’s about having fun and doing your best”....although the way they get to that is admittedly clumsy.I also liked the few moments when the show felt relatively grounded. For example, the girls and guys being friends and hanging out without it turning romantic. You don’t see that enough in anime IMO.The bad:Now. The main problem of the show: the goddamn MC.He is so. Boring.I’m sure that if you ask anyone who liked Tomozaki, they’ll say that the goal was to create an awkward, anxious and relatable protagonist. However, the truth is that he is just a classic case of the “let’s make an mc so bland that anyone can project themselves onto him” and I am so sick and tired of that trope. He just can’t carry a scene by himself at all, relying completely on the female side characters (I’ll get to those in a second) to make the series interesting. His one and only personality trait is being a gamer for fuck’s sake. The constant use of cringy language like “noob” “normies” and “bottom-tier” is also unbearable. It’s just hard to care about him when he is so unlikeable.The fan service also made me deeply uncomfortable. It’s not as obvious as in many other similar series, but it’s definitely there, even in scenes with his obviously underage sister (which, gross)I stated that I liked the female characters, however, it becomes increasingly obvious that they’re all written to appeal to certain “waifu types”. I could feel that this anime was made by sad, horny men, for sad, horny men (attributes of which only one applies to me - you gotta guess)Male side characters...exist. There’s not much to say, considering the show does not care about them at all, except to maybe pose them as a threat or romantic rival to the mc. I am also convinced that no one working on that series has ever had a guy on guy friendship, because apparently men only develop personalities in front of women.All in all, the shows premise was fun enough to pull me in and the voice acting and a few characters kept me invested, buuuuut it’s clearly pandering to a very specific demographic, namely self proclaimed unpopular guys whose greatest dream it is to get into some girls’ pants - this is reinforced by the comments posted under the episodes I watched - if I have to read one more person describing mc as a Chad I WILL simply combust.TLDR;An average show with a fun premise and a few really sweet characters. Its worst enemy is the boring, uninteresting MC who’s supposed to be a blank slate for equally horny and sad dudes to project themselves onto. Nonexistent male characters.

I was invested in the characters by the end and I enjoyed the story. It’s a shame it’s got so much unnecessary fan service. Fan service can be great and even comedic but having it wedged randomly between moments or growth and emotional storytelling is so gimmicky and off putting. For a show that tries to show you that people are more than just roles, they really do a 180 and force the female characters into typical fan service and sexualisation…. makes the emotional beats feel cheap.

She\'s a walking know-it-all, level-headed trope, then how is this woman capable of delivering that line is probably bad writing. Why she can\'t beat Tomozaki? Because she has a social life, she does other stuff other than learning the game all day. Talent only gets her so far, but in the end, ""gamer"" Tomozaki always takes the W because the sheer amount of shower he skipped. Cringe moments overload, that\'s probably expected from a shut-in.

He learns conversational skills, to correct his posture, and even how to get a girlfriend.The best part is that you can see the changes he learns, for example, he learns to use the vowels to express certain feelings in a conversation such as Uhh, Ah, and Ehhh, when the story continues you can see the character using those changes in his normal life.In the end, the Story takes a sudden turn where the character questions everything he learned until now and thinks if he should keep doing it because it changed him a lot, that was another interesting part I loved about the story, it seems like the creators thought the creation of characters out and created an incredible show with a lovely romance story and a way to even let the viewer question his life, skills, and appearance. see that shine here.Our Protagonist gets lectured by a certain person that doesn't want him to be like a cliche gamer: only at home, with no social interactions, and with bad grades.

Getting to know someone means communicating to them your values and way of thinking. Either by making jokes, simply discussing, or even with your aesthetic choices like the clothes you wear. There is of...course a limit to that approach, but Tomozaki-kun knows this. You cannot create worthwhile relationships just with that game. Tomozaki-kun (the anime, but also the character as well this time) lives on this thin line. The absolutely excellent penultimate episode is a fantastic representation of this conflict and showcases the complete control of its thematic component. It really caught me off guard.More than anything, it is nice to see people treated as people and taken seriously.If you are going to watch it, I would suggest not worrying about ticking checkboxes like ""does it have enough romance"" or whatever and just try to engage with the material.

The characters are great, the story is great and the enjoyment is without a doubt amazing. The negative reviews that I\'ve seen so far are hardly valid or correct and appear to be from the viewpoint of someone who hasn\'t watched past a single episode.As for the review, the development of Tomozaki\'s character from a social outcast to having multiple popular friends is impressive in itself, but what\'s even more impressive is how the anime portrays the troubles of the ""normie"" side as well. Most anime depict them as...having active social lives, hanging out with friends, partying and overall just enjoying life without a care. However, Jaku chara Tomozaki kun, not only depicts this fun part, but also their troubles in life, how they always try their best to adjust to the mood, how some can\'t even show their own true personalities and are hesitant to disagree with something despite not being okay with it.The MC, Tomozaki is a true underdog in social skills. He is a great representation of the otakus and socially anxious people. At certain points, his character is so relatable that you actually get excited when he accomplishes something by his own hardwork, as if it were you who accomplished it. He puts in the efforts and gets the result, there is no random buffs to his social skills. He also strongly believes that if his actions aren\'t genuine, he shouldn\'t do them.The Heroine, Aoi Hinami, Queen Bee of the school, sociable and friendly, is actually the most broken (in a negative sense) character in the anime and it\'s slowly revealed throughout the episodes. Her character has received a lot of criticism, calling her a typical Tsundere. In fact, she\'s far from it. Her way of thinking is completely cold and rational. Her every action is purely based on logic. While Tomozaki and her become good friends, there is no romantic relation between them, from either side. The reason she chose to help him is actually revealed later to be quite different from what is shown so far in the anime and it isn\'t because she\'s a Tsundere in love with him. Her character is complex and engaging, the more you learn about her, the more you want to know. She believes that the key to a successful social life is to manipulate each and every action and thought based on logic alone, hiding her true self under a mask and she refuses to show her original self to anyone. Her ideals are contradictory to Tomozaki and she believes that being genuine is just useless romantic talk.This dynamic is what makes the series interesting and it sparks small conflicts between Tomozaki and Hinami multiple times, leaving you wanting more. It is overall a worthwhile series, a fun watch and you might even learn some things from what Hinami teaches Tomozaki. It doesn\'t deserve most of the negativity it gets and I highly recommend watching atleast 3 episodes of it before judging. having active social lives, hanging out with friends, partying and overall just enjoying life without a care.

He also strongly believes that if his actions aren\'t genuine, he shouldn\'t do them.The Heroine, Aoi Hinami, Queen Bee of the school, sociable and friendly, is actually the most broken (in a negative sense) character in the anime and it\'s slowly revealed throughout the episodes. Her character has received a lot of criticism, calling her a typical Tsundere. In fact, she\'s far from it. Her way of thinking is completely cold and rational. Her every action is purely based on logic. While Tomozaki and her become good friends, there is no romantic relation between them, from either side. The reason she chose to help him is actually revealed later to be quite different from what is shown so far in the anime and it isn\'t because she\'s a Tsundere in love with him. Her character is complex and engaging, the more you learn about her, the more you want to know. She believes that the key to a successful social life is to manipulate each and every action and thought based on logic alone, hiding her true self under a mask and she refuses to show her original self to anyone. Her ideals are contradictory to Tomozaki and she believes that being genuine is just useless romantic talk.This dynamic is what makes the series interesting and it sparks small conflicts between Tomozaki and Hinami multiple times, leaving you wanting more. It is overall a worthwhile series, a fun watch and you might even learn some things from what Hinami teaches Tomozaki. It doesn\'t deserve most of the negativity it gets and I highly recommend watching atleast 3 episodes of it before judging.', 'Another type of show that we\'re probably spend more time focusing and arguing about best girl then the actual plot itself. The plot itself is pretty simple as in dealing with a ""loser"" or ""outcast"" trying to fit in with the ""popular"" or ""normie"" kids. Where he must try to win in this game of life by improving himself. Cool except, but at times I don\'t seem to care as much lol... It\'s a anime that has a interesting idea of treating life as a game and improving one self with the topic of identity/mask in there too. Though I won\'t say it\'s as good...as other that focus on such topics. It\'s one of those shows that treats it more lightly and I guess the main guy is pretty relatable to a degree.At first I didn\'t really enjoy this show, mainly due to the main girl, I didn\'t like her at first as much. Overtime I enjoy this more as I continued on with the show. It\'s one of those show that I don\'t feel like I would\'ve watched if I tried to binge this. But finishing it, I can say, it\'s pretty good.Well as for what it is, I say it\'s enjoyable enough to watch it if you really have nothing else to watch. The pacing is decent, it ain\'t gonna be like the anime of the year or the worst of the year. It kind of just stands in the middle that it doesn\'t really stand out or anything. It\'s not bottom-tier for sure.There\'s a romance plot that\'s actually pretty sweet in here. I do like that romance aspect of it, I was glad they didn\'t go the generic route I thought they were gonna go. So I do give them props for that one. I would\'ve dropped it if they did lol...Overall, a fun watch at times, there were moments that I really did enjoy and the concept of it was unique enough to peak my interest. As I do love the idea of identity and mask. As a few of my favorite shows does deal with such topics. If you want a more lighter theme on that topic, then check this out.It has a good cast of characters, that I do like a lot of the supporting cast. It does give a good decent amount of screen time to flush out the other characters, so that was a nice thing for them to do. Would I watch season 2 if they air? Yeah I think I would.Sorry my feeling for this show as you read here is kind of mixed at times lol... how I felt about it for most of the time.

A very shy protagonist who slowly comes out of his shell, only to end up with a lot of girls around him.It's a very generic anime, but it does well in the points where it should shine. The girls are cute and attention-grabbing, but they're very much left out when it's not their place to get into the scene, sometimes even giving you hints of love interests that don't make any noise anywhere. Clearly the plot development stagnates, but being a story that from the beginning seeks to win fans with...a simple idea, I think we shouldn't be too inflexible when it comes to giving it a grade.And it is precisely because of the above that I feel that many people give it a bad grade, just because they see the word GENERIC, miles away.

They made a Smash Bros anime.So, obvious bias, I love Super Smash Brothers. I play Smash64 competitively and have put many many hours into the franchise as a whole. When it showed the guy\'s box of used controllers I was like ""yup, that\'s me."" So just on the face of it, the fact that this is an anime that actually pays respect to and realistically depicts one of my favorite games ever, I\'m going to give it a great review. It\'d be a 10/10 if it didn\'t have some glaring problems.First off: the Smash elements, while well represented, are few and...far between in this anime that really just wants to be a typical slice of life harem. I would have loved a proper sports-anime treatment, where the game itself is the core conflict of the story. Instead we get the tired trope of main character is #1 at online games but bad at real life. On paper I think it\'s a kind of neat idea to take your typical Smash player and try to force him to be a real human being, but when you realize what that entails and how autistic it all is you start to see how it\'s not that fun to actually watch.Ok so, if you\'ve ever been to a Smash tournament or been around people who play the game competitively, I can attest, we are a bunch of weirdos. Each Smash game has it\'s own brand of sweaty, basement-dwelling NEET but they\'re pretty much all going to be social outcasts to some degree. It\'s definitely reasonable to gear your plot around trying to help M2K become a real boy with #lifegoals set up like a videogame, the problem is that just because it\'s realistic doesn\'t mean it makes for a good story.I really, really wanted to like this show. I think even now I\'m being more generous to it that it deserves. It\'s just that by the 5 or 6th episode I found myself so disillusioned with the whole concept and by the end I was just glad it was over and I could check it off my watching list. It just got so boring. But it\'s Smash Bros!Okay I keep praising it for being an accurate representation of Smash but I wouldn\'t be a true fan if I didn\'t nitpick and point out every single thing they got even slightly wrong. First off, no top players would ever use online matches as a gauge for skill. The game being portrayed in the show is obviously supposed to be Ultimate, which has no rollback netcode. Basically before the next frame of gameplay can be updated it has to go through the connection to both players first, witch causes huge lag spikes and makes the whole thing feel jittery, especially if you\'re playing someone far away. Online in Ultimate  is something top players will stream for fun, or use only in the most dire of circumstances (2020.) I don\'t know if they have a ranking system like the one portrayed in the show, but even if they do top players will probably ignore it and just go with their own community driven power ranking system, which relies on tournament results and other various statistical metrics to track worldwide rankings. Such a list would never be displayed in game.This is nit-picky because I realize it\'s easier to convey their skill level in the show to an audience of normies if it\'s just a list displayed in game, but this is the part where I nitpick so there you have it. The part where he talks about jump-squats/short-hopping is really on point, that\'s exactly the sort of basic movement mechanic you\'d want to teach a new player. The problem there again is that they\'re playing Ultimate, where you can set dedicated buttons or button combos for those movement options and also short-hop aerials and other stuff that lowers the skill-ceiling and makes it so new players probably don\'t even have to learn stuff like that. The stopwatch thing was also really... something. Not what I\'d recommend to do, honestly. If you want to get good at something practice doing that thing, not something else similar to it. Also the way he drew out on a piece of paper all the hitboxes of Fox or Shiek or whoever it was supposed to be... Frame data is important but not even Mew2King would be able to do that, and he\'s literally called the smash robot for the way he memorizes things. I would just send a link to the relevant frame data on one of the many sites that tracks it, but I wouldn\'t even do that because she was a new player and doesn\'t need to memorize all that stuff anyway.Anyway, nitpicking over, before I close I want to talk about my favorite scene in the whole show and why I\'m giving it a good score overall despite not really liking most of it. The scene comes when the King of Normies guy challenges protagonist-kun to a rematch. I\'m sorry for using normie, there\'s no good translation for the way gaming otaku use the English word ""real"" (as in real life, and the people who live it in rather than in the game) so I\'ll go with the most popular ""how do you do fellow kids"" translation that Funimation execs think makes them sound hip and relevant. Anyway what was I on about? Oh yes my favorite part.So King Normie lost to our hero in the first episode and comes back later after having practiced the game a bunch against his other friends. But he still loses. And he loses again, and again, and again. But he doesn\'t stop trying, even though he keeps losing and he knows he\'s going to keep losing he doesn\'t stop. And the protagonist actually developed more respect for him in all those losses because he kept on trying than in the first episode when he was all Johns (look it up I\'ve already explained too much Smash lore.)The tirade our protagonist goes on against the gyaru bitch was probably my favorite sports anime like moment in the whole show, and I think embodies everything great about smash and about esports and competitive gaming in general. I don\'t know if the people who played soccer or tennis or whatever in high school watch the soccer or the tennis anime and get super hyped when they here an inspiration speech about having passion about your game, but this was that moment for me. I didn\'t really like the protagonist as a person until that moment, when he won me over with his genuine passion for a game I actually understand, and know exactly what he\'s on about. I didn\'t really like much of what the rest of the show did, but for this one moment I give it my praise.9/10 far between in this anime that really just wants to be a typical slice of life harem.

First of all it has so many characters and by so many characters I mean the characters which are important to the story and we don\'t know a bit about any of \'em, and...this implies to the mc too, personally I think for a story loke this we should get some depth and a deep understanding  of the characters which it clearly misses.Mc is a hardcore gamer who believe that reality is a shity game and he was given the lowest ranking character, so he gave up on thos game called reality (which is our world) although he says that but while he plays his favourite game(who\'s name I forgot) he explains to others that he could win this game with any of the characters given in the gamea nd he does and become the no.1 palyer in Japan. The no.2 player who coincidentally is his classmate and the most popular girl of the school looks up to no.1 player which happens to be our shitty mc. She( the no.2 player and most popular girl) invites mc to meet not knowing that he is her classmate. When they two meet each other she( I am ver bad with remembering names so bear with it) is utterly disappointed by the fact that the person who she looks upto is a walking disappointment and has given up on life. Then the story starts of self improvement (not exactly self improvement cause the female mc guide him to do things).The good part of this anime is that we get to see our mc getting embarrassed by the tasks which are given to him by her( female mc and no.2 player of japan in that game which our mc likes to play). That\'s it, there is nothing more, at least from my pov.Overall if you are new to anime you can watch this show without any hesitation cause it will provide you what you are looking for(waifussss) and if you are veteran weeb or somewhat old to anime amd don\'t want to waste your time on a ""fair"" show you probably should stay away l, but if you are like me and doesn\'t give a damn about te management and others reviews, go watch it and decided for yourself that you like it or not.If somehow you come to like it please reply to this( if mal has a reply option, I don\'t know 😅) review this implies to the mc too, personally I think for a story loke this we should get some depth and a deep understanding  of the characters which it clearly misses.Mc is a hardcore gamer who believe that reality is a shity game and he was given the lowest ranking character, so he gave up on thos game called reality (which is our world) although he says that but while he plays his favourite game(who\'s name I forgot) he explains to others that he could win this game with any of the characters given in the gamea nd he does and become the no.1 palyer in Japan.

Then the story starts of self improvement (not exactly self improvement cause the female mc guide him to do things).The good part of this anime is that we get to see our mc getting embarrassed by the tasks which are given to him by her( female mc and no.2 player of japan in that game which our mc likes to play). That\'s it, there is nothing more, at least from my pov.Overall if you are new to anime you can watch this show without any hesitation cause it will provide you what you are looking for(waifussss) and if you are veteran weeb or somewhat old to anime amd don\'t want to waste your time on a ""fair"" show you probably should stay away l, but if you are like me and doesn\'t give a damn about te management and others reviews, go watch it and decided for yourself that you like it or not.If somehow you come to like it please reply to this( if mal has a reply option, I don\'t know 😅) review', ""This show basically tells about the various faces a person can have. As we are progressing towards development and advancements with the speed of light, people are deploying many faces with the same speed.I was shocked to see these high school kids that were shown had to put up with so much  just to be in limelight. I recently completed my college and I never went through such experiences and that makes me thing that the recent times are really scary.But the thing for shut ins is same every where.But coming to story it was good, but too much artificial.It was good but...I really didn't like it that much. I really didn't like it that much."", 'Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki-Kun Anime ReviewBy: Azrael Anacleto aka Cyranical[This review contains minor spoilers, read at your own risk]Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki-Kun is the anime adaptation of the light novel by Yuki Yaka. It tells the story of a gamer named Tomozaki that has given up on life, and has decided that it is thrash compared to the game that he been playing and top ranked in,Attack Families also better known as Atafami, that game being  a parody of Super Smash Bros. Tomozaki continues to spend his days as a loner gamer, he doesn\'t fix himself up and doesn\'t bother to do...anything except play Atafami all day everyday. All this changes after he beats the rank 2 player in Atafami that is known by the alias of No Name, the latter then arranges a meeting for them, manages to convince Tomozaki that life is actually a good game, and then becomes his coach in how to live a better high-school normie life.Okay so when I first started watching this anime, I was expecting it to be generic slice of life romcom ass, but it was surprisingly better than how I expected it to be. It got me hooked and I marathoned all 9 episodes in 1 day, then I heard it\'s based off a light novel originally, so I started reading that while waiting for the future episodes, it even got to the point that I read volume 3 first before I continued episodes 10 and beyond, so that I wasn\'t spoiled on what was going to happen in volume 3.The anime is surprisingly entertaining, for having a pretty generic premise and plot. Now if you ask me what makes it stand-out compared to the generic gamer life romcom slice of life anime out there, then I would have to say the characters, they are surprisingly likeable and have some depth into them, now only a couple of them actually have depth, and that depth is not as deep as what you\'re probably expecting a good example of this is Mizusawa\'s character, he appears to be the generic right hand man in the clique character but he actually has a true personality that he doesn\'t show people, now granted when that was revealed it was less appealing and shallow than I expected, they are already a lot of characters in the anime verse that have a social mask that makes everyone like and adore them, furthermore deep inside they are either ruthlessly cold, or are unable to follow their true feelings or what they truly want to do, this is the case for Mizusawa, now this may be shallower to Hinami\'s impregnable mask and depth as a character, but for a supporting character in a show like Tomozaki-Kun that has a very carefree, laid-back and has a relaxing atmosphere to it, it works perfectly.Now let\'s move to the other character\'s; Tomozaki is surprisingly a interesting MC even tho he doesn\'t appear like it, and he can come up with exciting and unique plans sometimes, since let\'s face it the dude is practically gamer Hachiman lol. The other supporting characters such as Tama-Chan Izumi, Mimimi, Takei and Nakamura are very entertaining and funny when they are on screen, which was a surprise to me that I somehow enjoyed generic semi-abstract character archetypes, but hey I guess the anime did a pretty good job at that front.Next up the animation was also pretty good, since it feels great to finally see these characters come to life in the big screen. The ED and Op were also decent, but they don\'t have replayability for me unfortunately, maybe listening to them 2 to 3 times is enough for me, but I\'m sure the people that liked this anime also liked the ED and OP, and have listened to it multiple times. Finally the anime makes some changes, though they are very minor in size and don\'t really affect the story, they just change a few things here and there in how certain events will unfold, but besides that everything practically stays the same, which I love, incidentally if you\'ve been following me and my reviews for a while you\'ll know that I\'m a sucker for when an anime or movie changes things up, and manages to still execute things properly despite not ruining the show, Tomozaki-Kun does that although to a very minor degree, but still it manages to change things up a little while negating some of the cringe parts and interactions in the light novel. When I was watching the anime it made cringe parts, character interactions, and some dialogue a lot better, a good example of this is when Tomozaki messed with Nakamura 3 times, in the light novel he did it by telling him off the first time, then by making back to back dick jokes for the next times, which was kinda cringe for me since it was super obvious that\'s what he was going for and the ones he made wasn\'t that funny, especially the first one, the second one was kind of a savage moment tho hahaha.Moving on to the negatives, first one is that come on man I know it\'s an anime based off japanese literature, but how unrealistic and full-off plot conveniences can you get, okay so the hottest girl in school is a top gamer and is also willing to help out some loser in order to be a better person, lol this is definitely not the case in real life, next up this guy Tomozaki ends up in spots where he\'s either doomed to get clowned, embarrass himself, or needs to get bailed out because of his timings, non-existent social skills, and weird dialogue; but every single time it\'s supposed to be the end of the road for him he either says some really stupid stuff and the characters just chew it up hook like and slinker or he get\'s bailed out by Hinami and company like what, like okay sure it happened one time just so the story can progress, okay sure I\'m willing to let it slide, what it happened again for the same purpose as well okay whatever it is what it is, but then after those first two times it just keeps on repeating and repeating, like come on that\'s like the 6th time they did it man, ""Like Why are doing this?? Like what is the purpose of this man?? It\'s just annoying and  done for plot conveniences only, unfortunately the sad part about this negative right here is that it is extremely blantant and a repeat offender as well.Secondly, the dialogue man, author come on dude are you actually speaking from personal experience here, since this guy might actually be a gamer loner otaku turned light novel author that went through a shitty life like Tomozaki but without ever changing or having a Hinami that will help him out by his side. The reason I think so is because this guy legit writes the most cringe, unexpectedly bad dialogue out there, like during some conversations in the anime and in the light novel, I\'m just sitting here like,""Did he really just say that?\' ""Oh come on how did that worked?"" ""How did you even come up with that bro?"" Author!!! See what I mean there are certain times when I\'m just, I\'m just befuddled and yet cringing at the same time, I don\'t know if I\'m supposed to laugh at how bad the dialogue is or how stupid it is. Come on author; do a better job at your character\'s dialogue for pete\'s sake, the anime is starting to get good, ""Why are trying to ruin your own work man?"" And here I thought this guy finally learned his lesson, guess he still didn\'t.Finally the final negative, some arcs such as the Mimimi consulation  arc are kinda lackluster, compared to the opening arc, the election arc which is techinally a part of the Mimimi consulation part as well but I would like to think that it is not, and the normie BBQ trip arc, like what I was saying the Mimimi consulation part just kinda falls  flat on it\'s face when compared or put beside these other parts, I mean sure it\'s not bad it\'s just kinda boring and annoying compared to the rest of the show. I even remember that I had to drag out time, and pause for a little while to do something else when I got to that part and  then go back later to finish it, since I was really bored and annoyed of that part during my watch of the anime; well I guess it helps out that after that it get\'s better from there.Pros:-Changes minor things up and succeeds making some scenes and dialogue a lot smoother than in the light novel-Entertaining and fun characters-Decent OP and ED-Some characters have depth that makes them interesting to watch-Surprisingly decent despite it having a generic plot and premise-Good animationCons:-Cringe and really bad dialogue from time to time-Sometimes Mc get\'s away unscathed out of sticky situations because there is too much plot convenience-Highly unrealistic-Certain arcs are lackluster compared to the other onesOverall Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki-Kun is surprisingly better than what it seems like, it manages to have entertaining characters and decent story arcs surronding a what seems like a dull MC on the surface, but is actually a decent one once you get to know him a lot better through the show. Now granted it does have some major flaws, like how it feels like a gamer loner\'s fantasy story, it having cringe and weird dialogue from time to time, and some of it\'s other arcs being less interesting and lacking in quality compared to the other ones, but it\'s surprisingly a fun and interesting watch, especially it\'s light novel, btw maybe you wanna read it imo it\'s better than the anime, but yeah if you\'re looking for a new seasonal romcom anime to watch, then yeah give Bottom Tier Tomazaki-Kun a watch, you should be able to enjoy it fairly decently. To conclude this review, I give Bottom Tier Character Tomozaki-Kun a 7/10 for my overall anime rating. Cyranical out. anything except play Atafami all day everyday.

Cyranical out.', ""The anime is really great and is a really great addition to this type of genre show as nowadays not much anime that are like this are created. This anime is like OREGAIRU but better imo. It takes what is great about these kind of romcom anime but removing the unnecessary part. The anime is geared more towards the development of the characters rather than throwing funny jokes and making you laugh. Instead it focuses on making you understand why the character does this and with what they would actually do, perform interesting things to make you laugh and enjoy.Story - 9/10The story is...really really great. It starts off with an interesting concept and gradually add more and more into it but never forget its essence of why we are watching this anime. The anime focuses more on the development of the characters rather than flashy or funny scenes. However, the anime is still really funny and have scenes which just makes you go Wow! Do be warn that this anime contains actual story and the story actually progresses!Art - 8/10The artstyle is a little bit unique and imo very great. It has quite a realistic approach to their artstyle. The way they draw aren't very POP or stylish but rather much realistic. It doesn't have a super big budget wow art but rather a modest modern good looking artstyle. After a while, I have came to really fall in love with their artstyle.Sound - 6/10The sound is pretty lacking in this anime. Its not the worst but not the best. It doesn't have a super unique memorable soundtrack but their music and sound are utilized properly at the right time and at the right feel.Character - 9/10The characters are all super super interesting. They perfectly utilizes their character to make the anime even more interesting. They understand what makes a character good. Also all the girls are waifu tier and i had a hard time choosing one...Enjoyment - 10/10Overall, i really really love it. Its hard to find an anime that i am this attracted to and so invested in. Most school romcom are just too comedic and lacks little to no story which does not appeal to me. However, this anime to me, has a really good balance between funny comedy and story. I like anime which has more story than comedy or action scene so this was really enjoyable.All i can say is its really good and is in the top rankings of my romance or school life anime list. really really great.

It\'s been a long time after watching more anime. But this anime is the ""Don\'t judge the anime by its first episode"" type. It really opened me up to morals that myself needs to learn because I\'m antisocial asf.Story - 8This is one of the better plot that I have seen and how they use it is amazing, i didn\'t know something so generic and boring waves of arc stereotype is fun to watch. I cannot say it\'s perfect, but it\'s definitely a new set of fresh air for...how much bullshit I have watched.Art - 7Art is pretty nice. Yeah, they kinda fall short on some scenes, and I hate some character designs (Mimimi looks like Phil from TPN and I hate it), but it gets the job done fashionably.Sound - 6This is the lowest part for me. I think some soundtracks fall flat with the scenes used in a period of time. The OP is great, ED is kinda meh. And yeah, I can\'t really criticize it other than that. Some soundtracks don\'t really fit with its scene, but that\'s about it.Character - 7I think when there is a great story, there are a great cast. And undeniably, yes the cast is great... in some areas. I like Tomozaki because he teaches you that you should find your desires in life because you will never find happiness in life if you always wear your mask. But he also gets staked because he abandoned a certain someone as the price. I think the risks with the main cast really outstretches the capability of their character and how the supporting characters helped the main character grow. But then again, not perfect. Some characters, I wish had more development, but that is just a minor thing because.... they are only supporting characters. (Kikuchi flags, rise!)(But seriously tho, they added too much Kikuchi that other cast is left out.)Enjoyment - 8Hell, I enjoyed this a lot. I didn\'t at first because of that cringe first two episodes, but then the show grew more contended to it\'s theme. I wish they did that sooner, but its really a perfect example that patient watchers can get gold lol.Overall, it\'s a solid 7. It\'s not perfect, yes but it definitely showed a lot of lessons that is pretty much relevant to our social life and yes I do have to listen to this lol. Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun! is some of the best shows for Winter 2021, because it\'s plot and theme shows that not everything can be done by effort, if you can\'t enjoy what you truly want to do. how much bullshit I have watched.Art - 7Art is pretty nice.

Do you stink? Do women run away from you?? Well, I got the perfect solution for you! It’s simple, easy, and takes less than a day. All you gotta do is sit down… and think about getting your life back together. And when you’re done, you can watch Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-Kun.Tomozaki is your average ideal gamer. Only earning the title as the best Buper Bash Bros gamer in Japan, which I’m sure many of you could relate. And like how most of you could also relate… he is a loser, a nerd, geek, incel, a typical average smelly little GAMER that...receives the face of disgust every time he walks by someone in the hallways (not that I also experience that or anything…). And, because of having little to no social ques, he blames the world for being so unfair towards him. Calling it a “stupid pay-to-win game”, he strays further and further from society, creating a never-ending cycle in which he would never try escape from.But one day, he plays against N-N-N-No-Name, the second-best Buper Bash Bros player in Japan. Getting curious about who that special someone is, Tomozaki decides to go out of his comfort zone and invites to hangout. In which he realizes that she is actually a girl… never seen those in a while!.... And on top of that, she is “Hinami”, one of the best and most popular students in his school. Getting offended about Tomozaki’s GAMER STENCH, she decides to help clean him up and implement him back into a decent member of society.Similar to the structure of an RPG, Tomozaki receives quests from Hinami in which he has to complete before a certain time frame. Brining out his INNER GAMER (*says in a very deep voice*), Tomozaki decides to take on these quests and beat the game he calls life.This isn’t really a romance anime, but a tutorial for losers like me on how to become a decent person in society. It doesn’t mainly focus on romance like a typical romance anime but on society as a whole. Sure, there are some aspects to romance, but it makes sure to show it in an observatory sense as possible. Making it feel like the main character is playing a dating-sim rather than actually developing feelings. It focusses significantly more on how Tomozaki maneuvers around the game of life and the skills he picks up from experience and other experienced players.At first, I saw Tomozaki as a generic self-insert character meant to gain sympathy from sweaty incels. He is awkward and views the world as unfair without even putting in any significant amount of effort. But I soon realized that is his whole purpose. To start him off as a loser of a person to become someone better. There is nowhere to go but up once you hit rock bottom. It’s not just his looks that improve but also his confidence, social skills, and attitude towards society in general.Tomozaki also uses the fact that he is a pro-gamer to give him opportuties to succeed. Which I think is cool because most shows use the aspect of the main character being a gamer or otaku as a tool for relatability. But they actually use the fact of being a gamer more than just that, I don’t know why, but it makes me feel happy whenever is see him relate real life things into game mechanics. Seeing life portrayed in something that I can actually connect to makes me also want to play this so-called game of life as well.Hinami Aoi is the opposite of Tomozaki where she has a lot of friends, in a club, and has good grades. Her socializing skills are extraordinary, and while being double faced, she’s also kind to the people she cares about. She serves as a sensei for Tomozaki giving him quests to complete. It’s also truly terrifying how much information she can learn just from observing people and their social ques. I know it’s just an anime, but dammb, this girl should’ve been on death note.The other characters were constructed pretty well. They act like normal people and have their own personalities and ideals. Such as Nanami’s desire to be the best, Kikuchi’s love for books, Izumi’s attachment towards the cocky douche bag Nakamura, and Natsubayashi’s stubbornness to not wield to society.Each Character has their own personality and look. All their clothing matches their personality. Take for example Hinami’s casual… drip... Her earrings and puffed-up clothes perfectly match her self-confidence and desire to look her best in front of other people. She looks mature, in which she is supposed to be in order to be Tomozaki’s sensei.But for some reason, I felt there was something missing. A missing puzzle piece that I so badly wanted to fill in. Sure, the characters acted human, but they never felt human. They had their own personalities, emotions, and struggles, but I feel like they were only being used just to progress the story.Nanami was a prime example of what I noticed. She was bitter of Hinami for being the star student that can do anything, feeling as if no matter how much she tried she will never become equals. This on its own, is a great concept of humanizing a character, showing their side of week and vulnerable. However, we only get to see so little of these sides before we’re forced move on to a different plot point. Granted, the producers were only given 12 episodes to work with. But that still doesn’t change the point that I think these subjects should’ve been explored more.I also have a problem, teeny tinny problem, with what the conveying message is. It mainly focuses on the improvement on looks and social skills to beat the game of life rather than improving academics and joining clubs. Sure, having many friends may help you beat life in the short run, however getting good academics and finding a stable career path would benefit you much better in the long run. (God Damb dude… I’m sounding like my dad…)But I guess this message is mainly targeting towards anti-social hikimori’s. Who definitely need better hygiene and social skills over anything else…For some reason, the narrative weirdly changed from a tutorial game format to a knockoff Oregairu parody (searching for the “true” relationship), but then transitioning back to as before in the last 5 minutes of the last episode. Idk, it felt kind of cheesy to me, and if they were going to introduce a heavy subject like this, I wouldn’t think of it as a good idea for them to start at the last 2 minutes of the second to last episode, which further ensures my point in the video that I think the subject this show tackles should be explored more.Overall, I would rate this show is a 4 out of 10. It contains the same deeper societal aspects such as Oregairu however, big however, large however, phattest however ever, lacking in character depth. With the structure of Dr. Stone, it has a very unique concept that I think any anime fan should experience. Even if you didn’t enjoy it, you could still BOP to the Sweeeet openings and endings songs. The opening perfectly fitting the game concept with it is Gameboy’isk 8-bit synths. I swear get the sudden urge to dance every time, and it never gets freeeeking old! receives the face of disgust every time he walks by someone in the hallways (not that I also experience that or anything…). And, because of having little to no social ques, he blames the world for being so unfair towards him. Calling it a “stupid pay-to-win game”, he strays further and further from society, creating a never-ending cycle in which he would never try escape from.But one day, he plays against N-N-N-No-Name, the second-best Buper Bash Bros player in Japan. Getting curious about who that special someone is, Tomozaki decides to go out of his comfort zone and invites to hangout. In which he realizes that she is actually a girl… never seen those in a while!.... And on top of that, she is “Hinami”, one of the best and most popular students in his school. Getting offended about Tomozaki’s GAMER STENCH, she decides to help clean him up and implement him back into a decent member of society.Similar to the structure of an RPG, Tomozaki receives quests from Hinami in which he has to complete before a certain time frame. Brining out his INNER GAMER (*says in a very deep voice*), Tomozaki decides to take on these quests and beat the game he calls life.This isn’t really a romance anime, but a tutorial for losers like me on how to become a decent person in society. It doesn’t mainly focus on romance like a typical romance anime but on society as a whole. Sure, there are some aspects to romance, but it makes sure to show it in an observatory sense as possible. Making it feel like the main character is playing a dating-sim rather than actually developing feelings. It focusses significantly more on how Tomozaki maneuvers around the game of life and the skills he picks up from experience and other experienced players.At first, I saw Tomozaki as a generic self-insert character meant to gain sympathy from sweaty incels. He is awkward and views the world as unfair without even putting in any significant amount of effort. But I soon realized that is his whole purpose. To start him off as a loser of a person to become someone better. There is nowhere to go but up once you hit rock bottom. It’s not just his looks that improve but also his confidence, social skills, and attitude towards society in general.Tomozaki also uses the fact that he is a pro-gamer to give him opportuties to succeed. Which I think is cool because most shows use the aspect of the main character being a gamer or otaku as a tool for relatability. But they actually use the fact of being a gamer more than just that, I don’t know why, but it makes me feel happy whenever is see him relate real life things into game mechanics. Seeing life portrayed in something that I can actually connect to makes me also want to play this so-called game of life as well.Hinami Aoi is the opposite of Tomozaki where she has a lot of friends, in a club, and has good grades. Her socializing skills are extraordinary, and while being double faced, she’s also kind to the people she cares about. She serves as a sensei for Tomozaki giving him quests to complete. It’s also truly terrifying how much information she can learn just from observing people and their social ques. I know it’s just an anime, but dammb, this girl should’ve been on death note.The other characters were constructed pretty well. They act like normal people and have their own personalities and ideals. Such as Nanami’s desire to be the best, Kikuchi’s love for books, Izumi’s attachment towards the cocky douche bag Nakamura, and Natsubayashi’s stubbornness to not wield to society.Each Character has their own personality and look. All their clothing matches their personality. Take for example Hinami’s casual… drip... Her earrings and puffed-up clothes perfectly match her self-confidence and desire to look her best in front of other people. She looks mature, in which she is supposed to be in order to be Tomozaki’s sensei.But for some reason, I felt there was something missing. A missing puzzle piece that I so badly wanted to fill in. Sure, the characters acted human, but they never felt human. They had their own personalities, emotions, and struggles, but I feel like they were only being used just to progress the story.Nanami was a prime example of what I noticed. She was bitter of Hinami for being the star student that can do anything, feeling as if no matter how much she tried she will never become equals. This on its own, is a great concept of humanizing a character, showing their side of week and vulnerable. However, we only get to see so little of these sides before we’re forced move on to a different plot point. Granted, the producers were only given 12 episodes to work with. But that still doesn’t change the point that I think these subjects should’ve been explored more.I also have a problem, teeny tinny problem, with what the conveying message is. It mainly focuses on the improvement on looks and social skills to beat the game of life rather than improving academics and joining clubs. Sure, having many friends may help you beat life in the short run, however getting good academics and finding a stable career path would benefit you much better in the long run. (God Damb dude… I’m sounding like my dad…)But I guess this message is mainly targeting towards anti-social hikimori’s.

I started it and was immediately brought back to ""Gamers!"" and I got very excited, I didn\'t keep that excitement though but then I got excited again (for a totally new reason).The premise is about having the two top gamers of ""Tackfam"" (a Smash Bros. clone) meet and improve their skills in not just the game itself, but the game of life. Hinami is pretty douchey to start, which is a big turn-off, especially since it\'s what kicks off the premise. I like the idea of having Tomozaki, the main character, be ""bottom tier"" in real life but...A-class in-game and having someone come in and help him improve on real life and balancing out the two.There are plenty of ways they could\'ve gone about it. Maybe rather than Hinami talking trash about Tomozaki from the start, he could\'ve self-depreciated and Hinami would drag him along to show him that life is a worthy game as well, proving him wrong, showing him what there is to like about himself. Her being a tsundere makes things complicated, it makes it seem almost unintentional because of how she says that she\'s disappointed that the gamer she looked up to turned out to be ""him"", like she\'s only doing it out of ""duty"" or selfish reasons .My main concern was that it would make me uncomfortable with the main character\'s nature because I too am introverted and currently a shut-in (mainly due to covid) who didn\'t really interact with people at school anyway. Does it trigger me? No, mainly because of it\'s \'jokey\' nature and dancing around the topic plus they make Tomozaki basically start from the bottom (probably even lower than me but given way more opportunities than me, I mean come on, it\'s an anime!) Though when I was a freshman in high school, a friend would do that to me and bet me that I couldn\'t talk to 3-5 girls during lunch period, he had good intentions though (even if he didn\'t have a girlfriend, himself :3). Same idea, same goals.But I wanted to mention that Tomozaki makes a jump and I mean a BIG jump in a short amount of time from episode 3 to 4, so if you\'re thinking about dropping this like I was, then wait until then. If you\'re interested in what I\'ve said so far then you will probably like it, if not then you already know what I\'m going to say but keep in mind that until those last few episodes, I was going to rate this a 6, I was going to call it ""mid"" but it turned me around real quick.Here\'s where I talk about the rest: (Some spoilers ahead!)It turns out that it\'s not so much like Gamers! but something else. (Yet they have very similar intros and outros and Hinami has Tendou\'s voice actress!)She\'s basically building him up to ""make him worthy"" of being her boyfriend, whether she realizes it or not even if they don\'t outright say it, we know that\'s what it\'ll be. It makes her character even more unlikeable because she\'s trying to shape his personality, I\'m sure she doesn\'t realize it but that is just one character, I didn\'t talk about the others yet.You might think the rest of the characters are going to be love interests just like a harem but that\'s not really the plot, the others more or less already have someone designated as their love interest. There are only 2 that I can confidently say are love interests.I\'m not really a fan of Minmi\'s arc or character for that matter, if I had to change it up, I would cut out the harassment of the other girls and realign her arc a bit. She could still keep the second place complex but make the actions different, Tomozaki is more or less there as an observer for half of it and while he doesn\'t have to be directly involved, I don\'t think he really needed to be there for some of it. We don\'t get a whole lot of a look into her thoughts (partially because of this) which I think would\'ve really picked up some of that slack, it also makes it feel ""off-topic"" because yeah, Tomozaki cares how she feels but it takes away from his story (the main story) because after the campaign, it was no longer about him. It doesn\'t change the story, you could skip the arc, they never acknowledge it afterwards anyway, it\'s just back to the same stuff.As for art, I feel like Tomozaki is the stand out because the rest are very unique, and he just isn\'t. I don\'t like his design but I appreciate it, why? Because it makes him look the part. He looks like a default, average and generic character, it\'s intentional. By the end though, I felt like I had more in common with him than I thought, his actual character IS good, even if it\'s average. I could talk about the others but I\'ll let you figure that out.I like how Tomozaki takes a new route that he branched off into, realizing he can use games as a starting point to relate to others. I did that when I was in middle school because I wasn\'t really sure what else to talk about so I kept up to date on all the games coming out and what they were like even if I didn\'t actually play it. Then they double down in those last few and go for a ""genuine"" message and how towards the beginning they make up all the excuses such as playing as the wrong character and yet he blames himself because he himself is a bottom-tier character, it\'s poetic in a gamer sort of way. Not only that but it shifts perspectives from Tomozaki being the pet project to Harumi (a reason for her douche-like nature) and that\'s really the route we needed and certainly something I never saw coming.I\'m ready for any season 2 because I imagine the hurdles that it had to climb throughout bore down on the score a bit but now with that out of the way, the continuation has the potential to be excellent and I await its return, don\'t let the average rating stop you.

However, this is only online and in real life he’s essentially a loser. The second ranking player however, is a girl who is not only great at TackFam, but is also incredibly popular and good at pretty much everything. This girl, Hinami, unknowingly turns out to be in Tomozaki’s class, and when she finds out that her TackFam rival is him, she’s immensely disappointed. However, once they...start discussing life as if it’s a game, it ignites both their gamer spirits and Hinami decides she’s going to coach Tomozaki into becoming a top tier player at life as well.This anime is centered around Hinami giving Tomozaki objectives he has to complete in order to level up his real life character. These range from getting new outfits, to fixing his posture, to talking to a certain person three times a day for an entire week. The objectives aren’t all that game like in and of themselves, but the way they’re discussed and structured definitely gives them a major game like feel. Tomozaki slowly makes his way through the various objectives, and in the process goes through various changes and forms various connections as a result.It’s somewhat satisfying to see Tomozaki progress. But at the same time, it all seems so shallow. And I mean that in a number of ways. Firstly, none of the subplots that compose arcs seem to have much depth. There’s a subplot that’s centered around him competing at TackFam with another classmate who can’t get anywhere near close beating him, that culminates with him ranting about hard work and such. And while the core message is solid enough, it feels like its just kind of thrown out there and doesn’t really tie into anything and doesn’t really advance anything overarching.There’s also a much more expansive arc that’s centered around a girl named Minami who’s always second to Hinami at everything and how that makes her feel. This arc does a good of conveying why she has such a strong desire to compete with Hinami and why she feels so frustrated, but it doesn’t do all that good of a job at conveying how she actually overcomes that frustration. Essentially every other subplot and character arc feels like it faces the same issues, that it’s touching upon things that could be interesting, but that it’s not tackling them well enough to give a good take on them.The one exception to that is deeply connected to the other shallow aspect, how all of Tomozaki’s improvements seem pretty shallow. Part of that comes down to how critical superficial things like clothing and hairstyle are, but that’s pretty much true to reality so fair enough. The bigger issue is that Hinami genuinely treats life like a game that she’s just playing, and though that sounds kind of amusing, when taken as seriously as this anime does, it’s somewhat psychopathic. At times it genuinely feels like she’s treating people like NPCs that you just need to understand the patterns of in order to beat.This isn’t all that big of an issue with simple things like when she’s getting Tomozaki to memorize conversation starters or info that he can just throw out on demand in order to make conversations go more smoothly. While that is kind of fake it’s something that works well enough in a fake it till you make it sort of sense. But there are areas that seem a bit more extreme, the most prominent of them being how she picks out a girl for him to go out with because it seems to be the optimum way to proceed and says that it outright does not matter at all whether he actually likes her or not. She’s an overtly logical character, and while that can be interesting in higher stake or fantasy stories, in more grounded realistic ones it’s incredibly awkward.Thankfully, the narrative seems to tackle this shallowness aspect pretty directly. While Tomozaki just goes with the flow playing the game of life according to the guide for most of the anime, in the final arc he takes a step back and evaluates how he’s changed and where he’s headed. I think the writing does a pretty bad job of establishing why he decided to step back and reevaluate things in the first place. I also don’t think it does all that good of a job at conveying how he arrives at the answers he arrived at. Still, the answer he arrives at I think is a solid way to finish the season as it shows clear character growth not just as someone trying to win at a game, but as someone genuinely trying to improve their lives and be happier as a person. It’s a tad overdramatic, especially so as nothing involving Tomozaki had been anywhere near this dramatic and thus it stands out, but there being such a contrast fits thematically and it’s a season finale so I’ll give it a pass.The art and animation are solid enough. Design wise I feel like there were some characters that came through incredibly well, mainly Minami and Fuuka, but most of the cast felt somewhat dull. The OP grew on me a lot and by the end I was super fond of both the visuals and the audio. The ED was only okay in terms of both visuals and audio, though I did like how they got different characters to sing it based on who was focused on in the episode.

And I cant for the love of me grasp the thoughts of the female MC throughout the entire anime. Everything from how she acts to how she tries to make the male MC change into something she herself doesnt like. And it's very disappointing that there was never a proper background story to why she was so anti-life.

Enjoyment is, after all, the most important factor to an anime so that 7 is worth a lot.Would I recommend it to someone that wants a romance anime? Never! There's almost no actual romance in it. It's basically about the MC learning to be someone he's not.I can recommend it to someone who likes games and cringey and frustrating animes though.

All in all, it's worth a watch."", ""The phrase “subverting expectations” has become a cliche to the modern critic. Cliche or not, when an anime pulls it off well, it's a fairly rare experience, and I for one would be remiss if I didn't take the time to point it out to any would-be viewers.Here we have a typical disenfranchised introvert turned to a social success story. Using metaphor for video games as both its overarching theme and language between main characters. That may not sound very interesting but if you're a young person or anybody that's socially underdeveloped and video...games are a more relatable topic to you then the typical ones, then I could easily see this story meaning something special to you. Putting aside that obviously most animes are written to pander to their demographic.What I believe is most venerable about this presentation is, that it expresses a handful of viewpoints about difficult to discuss psychosocial thinking. Or in simpler terms, how after a certain age we all get stuck up in our own head to some degree. I really appreciated that so many characters were not overblown examples of any sort of specific perspective. Each character felt more human as a result of them not being ridiculous caricatures of their problems or emotional issues. instead it was subtle, giving rationale for the dialogue that explains their disposition.I also noticed that this anime didn't fall into the typical pitfall of having to need a villain. If we are enjoying the character and their struggles and growth, then we don't need anymore risk to keep us engaged. A grand adversary is an easy fix for an otherwise mediocre story. It was pleasant to see the plot move right along and have character growth without an overly simplistic “indomitable force” to overcome.It shouldn't be overlooked that these characters are somewhat flexible. Things happen, new information comes, time passes and our characters react and overtime behave differently.  What's more is this is written well enough to have the character express these changes more than once immediately after they happen. As such, relationships, just like in real life, change. Not dramatically mind you, but more realistically then I expected.Overall I believe that this is a quality, easy to watch and well written light anime for those of us that like to think about our friends, relationships and maybe have played many video games. games are a more relatable topic to you then the typical ones, then I could easily see this story meaning something special to you. Putting aside that obviously most animes are written to pander to their demographic.What I believe is most venerable about this presentation is, that it expresses a handful of viewpoints about difficult to discuss psychosocial thinking. Or in simpler terms, how after a certain age we all get stuck up in our own head to some degree. I really appreciated that so many characters were not overblown examples of any sort of specific perspective. Each character felt more human as a result of them not being ridiculous caricatures of their problems or emotional issues. instead it was subtle, giving rationale for the dialogue that explains their disposition.I also noticed that this anime didn't fall into the typical pitfall of having to need a villain. If we are enjoying the character and their struggles and growth, then we don't need anymore risk to keep us engaged. A grand adversary is an easy fix for an otherwise mediocre story. It was pleasant to see the plot move right along and have character growth without an overly simplistic “indomitable force” to overcome.It shouldn't be overlooked that these characters are somewhat flexible. Things happen, new information comes, time passes and our characters react and overtime behave differently.

Looks like we are not getting an ounce of harem vibes after all - very refreshing. It actually doesn\'t go the route it seems it will for the main story either. In episode 8 they hardly address his goals. Instead, the focus shifts to fixing issues within the social group.The emotions that the characters feel about one another are a lot more complicated than what I\'m used to seeing in anime and I believe their social pecking order is much more realistic. I think they are...developing characters slowly and fairly well.I don\'t have the faintest clue where the show is headed in the next four episodes.We haven\'t gotten to see much more of Tackfam past episode 4 or 5.So, I\'m still looking forward to seeing how it all ties up in the end. This is a true slice of life. If you keep that in mind and you\'re not expecting anything too mind-blowing, I think you\'ll like the series. It is definitely more of a character study than the ""wacky comedy"" is appears to be on the surface. developing characters slowly and fairly well.I don\'t have the faintest clue where the show is headed in the next four episodes.We haven\'t gotten to see much more of Tackfam past episode 4 or 5.So, I\'m still looking forward to seeing how it all ties up in the end.

But this beat my expectations 10-fold. The anime delivers on its summary and some with a surprising amount of depth that I feel has been lacking in a lot of recent series.So you have the first episode which I\'ve read a lot of people comment is cringeworthy. Personally I didn\'t find it as such and arguably that episode is doing exactly what I believe the summary is implying which is, present a character that has been so absent in living life it makes you uncomfortable and want him to change....so for it to be cringeworthy I think sets up the mood for the following episodes to develop. After watching the whole series and coming back to episode 1 I realize a lot of the clever plot points, themes, and foreshadowing they did that have remained consistent and even debated throughout the series which I think gives the anime as a whole a lot more depth than your average anime. So if you get bothered by episode 1... good and keep watching because your feelings will get resolved in the following episodes.Without spoiling much, the story really develops from there engaging many more characters where you feel like rooting for them all. The only thing that would have made it better IMO would be seeing more backstory to the other characters to understand their motivations and how they became who they are more clearly. To be clear myself they actually do some of this but I would have wanted a little bit more and all in all I consider this a minor flaw with respect to the entire series.Now as a side-note I do have my own bias. I consider myself a gamer and find a lot of his sentiments relatable including his initial view point on this game we call ""life"". So this did appeal to me more than I would say a person that didn\'t consider themselves a gamer.All in all you have a story that has a lot of developments with characters that go through an incredible amount of growth starting with cringe worthy beginnings to finally overcoming the epic boss level. so for it to be cringeworthy I think sets up the mood for the following episodes to develop.

It does have some steretorypes and common anime tropes, but it does well in portraying these in a way that doesnt come of as lazy or sexist.Notable parts of the anime:Story - 8The story follows Tomozaki, a loner gamer that is extremely good at his game by choice, but terrible at the game of life. Contrast this with his online rival, that turns out to be an extremely attractive and popular girl called Hinami.She takes him under his wing to show him...that life can be a ""god tier game"" if you give it a chance. Tomozaki during the course of the show developes his social skills and aquires friends, all with the help of Hinami. The story is extremely enjoyable.Character - 10What really makes this anime worthwile is its realistic take on common anime tropes. The main character isnt some loner that all the girls immidiatly fall in love with, the anime makes a point that relationships aren\'t as shallow as that. The girls are interested in other people, they have real motivations and are only able to talk with tomozaki after he aquires basic conversational skills. Tomozaki himself is shown as flawed, not ""dark and cool"" as other animes of the same genre, and frankly a loser.The anime is really enjoyable, if you like SOL that life can be a ""god tier game"" if you give it a chance.

The author wrote this story definitely understands the social contexts that teenagers and young adults go through. Growing up, from middle school and onwards we always see certain individuals always putting up a front; to make themselves look popular, pretty, and likeable. Whether it was the captain of a sports team or the president of your class,...there are always going to be people that go the extra mile to become someone that isn\'t themselves - in an effort to preserve a good public image.I always disliked when schoolmates or friends were not ""real"" with me.I think this show depicts this concept very well while maintaining a good amount of that usual enjoyable anime humor. There are going to be people who are going to be ""fake"" and will always be putting up a front when they\'re at school or other social gatherings. That\'s just the way society is - everyone wants to be popular and likeable. But then there\'s going to be people like Tomozaki - the bottom of the barrel, someone who does not care about their personal looks and public image. This show talks about the journey of how he finally strays away from this , and ultimately how he tries to change to become someone socially acceptable. With the help of Hinami, they treat life as a game where objectives and goals need to be accomplished and met. That is, if life was that easy and straightforward.Our main character Tomozaki starts to question what he really wants in this game of life - to continue putting up a mask and not being true to himself, or to be someone that is genuine (well portrayed from an entirely different anime) where people can like him for who he is rather than him always following a script or template that he and/or Hinami had prepped beforehand. Why are we so obsessed and stubborn to just be ourselves in front of others? Do we fear what others think of us? Is there ever a point where we\'re just tired of putting up this mask, a fake version of ourselves? These were questions that the show got me thinking when finishing the show.There are going to be people who think that Tomozaki as a character might be difficult or down right cringe to watch. But you have view the anime through the scope that he was a character that was a loner and lacked fundamental social skills. There are many times where he doesn\'t know if what he is saying fits certain social contexts or if he is reading the room correctly. He is bound to make errors, and he is testing the waters by trying to speak the right thing at the right time.If you want to watch something that is like Oregairu but a little less poetic and a bit more fast paced and humorous, then I think you will enjoy this show. As mentioned before, I enjoyed this show simply because how well it depicts social contexts of the modern age, and it really hits home as I\'ve seen it time and time again growing up and going to school. Don\'t sleep on this anime if you\'re someone who is fascinated by these types of sociology concepts. there are always going to be people that go the extra mile to become someone that isn\'t themselves - in an effort to preserve a good public image.I always disliked when schoolmates or friends were not ""real"" with me.I think this show depicts this concept very well while maintaining a good amount of that usual enjoyable anime humor.

Then, in corny fashion sets the show up like a gameshow with Hinami Aoi as the host and Tomozaki Fumiya as the guest, jumping through hoops set by the host to ""win prizes"", rather than the show just unfolding naturally like a slice of life would if it had just been a person naturally giving social advice. In this sense, i feel like the show loses a lot of potential/value even...though the show isn\'t actually listed as a slice of life, the show does come across as majorly contrived and this is a major turn off for me.Episodes 1 through 8 play out by the numbers, most things occurring as expected/being quite predictable. It\'s all rather condescending and cheap; and i thought it a little lazy that Fumiya, as the protagonist learning to socialise already had a herione ready and lined up waiting for him to interact with when it came for him to take the steps and raise the stakes with flirting with girl(s) and getting a girlfriend. It would have been more convincing/relatable if there was a character he had actual development with, like ""mimimi"" (but generally anyone he spent some time with and not someone who conveniently already happened to have a crush on him).Episodes 9 through 11 take a change for the better. We see some actual character interactions that don\'t play out like a cheap simulation. The supporting characters feel a lot more like people rather than NPC\'s and for a while i was thankful that i had continued up until this point. Then the show u-turns back to its original gameshow format in the finale. There is something of a plot twist where the protagonist learns the female lead a few things and sort of sets up the show for a second season where the male lead would teach the female the final secret to both beating him, the boss game player and the discovery he made about the value of interacting with people sincerely that is giving him better social results than the tactics used and learned from Aoi. In this i feel like most of the shows potential is locked in that part of the story.The animation is respectable, the characters are cute, but the show itself is dry with the exception of the 2-3 penultimate episodes.Would i recommend this show? Only if you had nothing else to watch and needed something to pass the time and/or found entertainment/service from cute characters doing cute things. If you want an actual substantial plot you wont find it here and that\'s not so much meant as a criticism because that\'s not always something you may look for in certain show formats.

He thinks of himself as not being able to fit in. As if he is some avatar in a video game with low stats in this “garbage game” called “life.” That’s why he calls himself a “bottom tier character.” Of course he is right, but this label is self imposed. He has decided to not play by life’s rules and just get good at video games instead. It’s kind of funny how in the first episode he literally says, “Don’t blame the game, blame the player,” when playing a fighting game called Takfam with someone else. His lack...of self awareness is why he is so miserable in the first place. He thinks life is unfair and that he just can’t compete. Though he makes no effort to recognize his own faults and act as if the game is rigged. This game is the only thing he’s good at. He’s the #1 player in the world in fact. With his life being nothing but Takfam, he is invited by the #2 player in the world to a meetup. Of course when they meet, Tomozaki is surprised to see that it’s Aoi Hinami, one of the more popular girls at school. Could this be the start of a beautiful love story? No. Though it is the start of something much more important: Self improvement. Hinami sees someone in need, who is broken, and she can fix him. Why she is so willing to put so much effort into one person I’m not sure. Maybe it’s their mutual love of a game, or she’s just that caring of a person. Regardless, this is a new endeavor for Fumiya Tomozaki. He’s on his way to conquering the god-tier game of life.The thing I like most about this show is its psychological and sociological aspects. I don’t know how much this story relies on the actual studies of psychology and sociology if at all. It could all be pseudoscience. Though all of it does make perfect sense within the context of the story, so it probably doesn’t matter. Most of this comes from Aoi Hinami who serves as a mentor to our protagonist. She has mastered the art of social interactions making her the opposite of Tomozaki in just about every way. She even takes notes on her conversations: Everyone’s personalities, how each person interacts in conversations, even subjects to bring up. She studies them and uses them to improve herself. Now is the time to pass on this knowledge to Tomozaki. I really like how much detail Hinami goes into when training Tomozaki. She talks about how each person has their social role. For example, in the second episode she calls one of her friends, Minami Nanami, a “people pleaser.” She usually just goes along with the group consensus, which probably makes it easier for her to fit in anywhere she goes. Also her bubbly and playful nature help endear her to other people. This type of stuff is very important. It helps Tomozaki in understanding how to socially interact with others.Unfortunately, less than half way through the show, these aspects start to fade. Hinami still gives Tomozaki “lectures” every now and again. It just kind of becomes more of a drama than anything else. Tomozaki does obtain a love interest which plays out like a typical romance. It is a part of his character development and the broader narrative of the show, so that makes sense. Where the show hits its low point is in the mid section. Apparently Aoi Hinami beat Minami Nanami in a basketball game a long time ago, and Nanami can’t let it go. So ever since then she’s been competing with Hinami in various ways. I guess you could say that she has an inferiority complex. Her backstory is taken way too seriously for what it is. It’s a simple story of jealousy. It comes out of nowhere. It wasn’t foreshadowed in any way. It kind of clashes with her personality. Maybe that was the point? She’s a super friendly person on the outside but an envious biaaatch on the inside. Maybe if this dynamic was explored more it wouldn’t be so bad, but it goes on way too long and is never mentioned again. It’s not what makes the show interesting anyway. To be honest, this whole arc should have been left out. Fortunately, after that the show starts to return to what it is good at. Some other characters develop, and Tomozaki continues to train his dating skills. Though towards the end a big shift happens. Tomozaki realizes what he wants in life. He starts to resent Hinamai’s cold and calculated approach to life and wants to pursue his own goals. Despite Hinami’s proficient social skills she doesn’t have a firm grasp on what she wants. In other words she isn’t in touch with her emotions. So instead of it being a student - master relationship, it’s now a mutual one. She will continue to mentor Tomozaki, and he will help her find what she wants. While I do think this is an interesting shift in the narrative, by the end it doesn’t return to what made the show so interesting to me in the first place. With that being said, I’d be happy to watch a second season to see if it ever does. of self awareness is why he is so miserable in the first place.

Apparently Aoi Hinami beat Minami Nanami in a basketball game a long time ago, and Nanami can’t let it go. So ever since then she’s been competing with Hinami in various ways. I guess you could say that she has an inferiority complex. Her backstory is taken way too seriously for what it is. It’s a simple story of jealousy. It comes out of nowhere. It wasn’t foreshadowed in any way. It kind of clashes with her personality. Maybe that was the point? She’s a super friendly person on the outside but an envious biaaatch on the inside. Maybe if this dynamic was explored more it wouldn’t be so bad, but it goes on way too long and is never mentioned again. It’s not what makes the show interesting anyway. To be honest, this whole arc should have been left out. Fortunately, after that the show starts to return to what it is good at. Some other characters develop, and Tomozaki continues to train his dating skills. Though towards the end a big shift happens. Tomozaki realizes what he wants in life. He starts to resent Hinamai’s cold and calculated approach to life and wants to pursue his own goals. Despite Hinami’s proficient social skills she doesn’t have a firm grasp on what she wants. In other words she isn’t in touch with her emotions. So instead of it being a student - master relationship, it’s now a mutual one. She will continue to mentor Tomozaki, and he will help her find what she wants. While I do think this is an interesting shift in the narrative, by the end it doesn’t return to what made the show so interesting to me in the first place. With that being said, I’d be happy to watch a second season to see if it ever does.', ""Hmmm, what to say, it's been a while since i made a review, so here it goes. It's more like a rant rather than a review i guess. Sorry for this, but I'm gonna go with the rant first.Well, what could I say, but, what a waste of good art and animation on a bad story.After I watched the first episode, I cringed hard. They could've at least added more depth to the main character's background, making his story much more compelling, building the foundations, reasons, factors as to why he acts like that, justifying his words and actions.His story would've had more meaning if...he came from a poor family, with a difficult life, living in a shabby home, with a dead beat dad and an abusive mom, and gaming is his only outlet for his frustrations, relatable right? You know this, i know you do.Zero to hero plot would most likely fit, because, it is about how to win in life coming of age story, as an underdog, right? Or am I wrong? I guess, it's just one of those cliche Rom-Coms huh? So no need for all that bs.I don't know about you guys but for me, this seems lacking, like most tasteless Rom-Coms out there and it's getting kinda boring to watch those shows. It has the potential to be great tho. Zero to hero Rom-Com style, which is pretty unusual and interesting. I guess i expected too much.Now for the actual review.Story: 5/10 - could have been great, if they gave much thought.Art: 9/10 - I have to admit, character designs are beautiful. The animation is good.Sound: 6/10 - Eh, so so.Characters: 5/10 - character developments are flawed, the first impression that left a bad taste in my mouth was the heroine acting friendly at first, then all of a sudden has a bitchy attitude and then friendly again, like make up your mind! As for the protagonist, i dunno what's his problem, he just suddenly felt like he was the most unluckiest person in the world, for no apparent reason, and blurted out cringeworthy stuff.Enjoyment: 6/10 - did I enjoy watching this? Certain aspects of it, yes.Overall: 7/10 - pretty generous of me right? Lol. Well, at the end of the day, my opinions, doesn't matter, it's up to you guys to decideCiao! he came from a poor family, with a difficult life, living in a shabby home, with a dead beat dad and an abusive mom, and gaming is his only outlet for his frustrations, relatable right?

Although the part about there being no such thing as what one truly wants makes my question myself, and after a lot of thinking i think this show actually has achieved what may shows didn't: motivate me to try what i really wanted to, like writing my first review because that's what i want. reconfiguration.

I can\'t even call it mid, calling it a mid anime would just disrespect the mids out there. The reason I\'m coming in so hot is how this got rated higher than 7.Story: From episode 1 to episode 12, we\'ve quite literally run a full circle in terms of the romantic relationship between Fumiya and Aoi. Starting from the first half I was starting to believe that Aoi was just a straight-up wingman and the anime would focus more on the MC\'s romantic relationship with Minami or at least Fuuka, hell even Yuuzu...just give me something that justifies a ""romance"" tag there. Jealousy is not even a thing in this anime, Aoi hasn\'t shown her jealousy but that\'s probably out of character since she always has a ""mask"" which is fine but what about our MC Fumiya who is known to be honest. During the scene when Takahiro (probably the best character in the series) confessed to Aoi, the only reaction we get out of the boy Fumiya is a ""pogU face"". So far the only romance route I can deduce is Fuuka and it\'s from the fact that she willingly goes on 1on1 dates with him.Art: Very basic facial expressions, yeah the MC got a hairdo wooh and I could barely even tell apart the difference.Sound: Nothing memorable. So I give it a Fair scoreCharacters: The top 2 characters in my opinion is not even the MCs. It\'s the little sister and Takahiro. You might think, really? but I thought the 2 MCs were the best. Yeah sure, we can count Aoi in the fact that she manages to stay in the character of having a ""mask"", if we want to count that as being a good character.Overall: TLDR; Don\'t bother watching, there\'s no point investing time into any of the supporting characters in this anime because they\'re just gonna get sidelined. You can\'t even support the main characters together because they clearly have no attraction towards one another. The interactions between each characters is insanely dull with little to no facial expressions. The progression is almost non-existent, you finish the anime and you realize nothing fucking happened in 12 episodes.Sorry for ranting, if you disagree with me and think this deserves higher than 7 then that\'s fine, hope you all have a nice day. just give me something that justifies a ""romance"" tag there.

Actually, if you find and read the manga adaptation, instantly you'll notice how uniquely the characters are drawn and designed in comparison to this show. The animation gets the job done, and sometimes has great key frames of certain characters, yet it never even attempts to be great or to stand out in any way.The story is one which progressively gets better. If this show gets a continuation I might raise my score on the character development alone, but atm there is no payoff to any of the sparks and hints of intrigue.Overall: Jaku-Chara...will keep you interested in Tomozaki's development and internal turmoil (if your willing to get past the rugged, cringe-filled beginning) yet I truly don't believe it will stand apart against the greats of the romance and slice of life genre.5-6/10 will keep you interested in Tomozaki's development and internal turmoil (if your willing to get past the rugged, cringe-filled beginning) yet I truly don't believe it will stand apart against the greats of the romance and slice of life genre.5-6/10"", 'Jaku-Chara is an scholar life anime that explores the ideas and morality behind social interaction, self-improvement messages and different points of view of it.Story:Tomozaki is an introvert gamer who has no interest for the people around him, but is the best player of a SmashBross-like videogame, Tackfam. One day he duels with the rank2 who has never beat him and after loosing ask him to meet irl.When Tomozaki arrives to the meeting he finds out the rank2 player is his classmate Aoi, the best student, athlete and most popular girl of his highschool. She seems dissapointed because she idolised the person behind the rank1, and...blames him for not being decently dressed, which leads to an argue in which Tomozaki blames real life for being unfair and illogical, making Aoi want to prove him wrong.So you can understand Aoi\'s character, she\'s like a completionist who sees everything like a videogame and only cares about being number 1. Everything from videogames to sports, studying and even social status.She instills in him this way of thinking and coach him to enjoy the game of life.Throughout the series, Tomozaki will complete task and apply tips to improve his social skills and presence, specially in the first 4 episodes, in which he will learn to dress, improve his posture, smile better... He also has to start talking to people, starting with the girl next to him.As Tomozaki advances, he starts getting friends in his class and also get the attention of Fuuka, a girl in his class, and whose Aoi tries to match him with. He will also get more involved with other character\'s problems and get to know them better, in some point even influencing and supporting them.Towards the end of the series, Aoi\'s methods starts to resonate to Tomozaki when Fuuka tell him that the methods he learnt for making more fluyent conversations feel a little artificial to her, making Tomozaki step back into dating her.Is at this point when the series questions its own philosophy and Tomozaki defies Aoi\'s methods, since he wants to enjoy life and seek for what he wants to be, which made a conflict with Aoi. She breaks up any conection to Tomozaki till he reach to her and challenge her to prove that his vision is the right one.Analysis:The build up of Tomozaki and how the series is able to questions itself and explore more points of view already makes this a level ahead of the average highschool romance or slice of life anime. It goes all the way around, and shows the pros of both points of view. While a bit simplistic, as anime tends to be, is worth of mention how it manage to subvert your expectations.The writting of Tomozaki and how he influence the people around him while improving himself and doesn\'t just blindly obey Aoi gives him enough depth as a character.The series changes 3 times its dynamics, starting by focusing on applying Aoi\'s techniques to improve conversational skills, look, posture... and showing results in a short time, with Tomozaki amaze of his results.The second dynamic would be Tomozaki focusing on more abstract task which mainly focus on secondary characters and their own conflicts, so Tomozaki gets closer to them, planting the seed for his doubts on the last episodes.And the third one is when Tomozaki starts having doubts, questioning Aoi\'s methods and has a moral conflict.If I were to say something, I\'d say the writting is pretty good, but the secondary characters are what fails the most. Many of them seem like avatars even though we get to see some of their problems.They have a variety of personalities, even portraying the kind of people many of us would\'ve found annoying in highschool as neutral as possible. Thing is their dialogues are pretty histrionic, even for anime, or saying extreme detailed information, acting more like NPCs in some moments of the story.An example of this would be Mimimin. Even if she\'s so charismatic, her conflict with Aoi when it came to athletism seemed forced because it came out of nowhere, and even comes in conflict with Tomozaki\'s later ideals. She can\'t keep up with Aoi and can\'t beat her at anything. I would understand if she was frustrated for loosing the elections to be a student council, but at that point it was healthy competition for her. Her quitting athletism seemed out of nowhere, I personally think a more realistic aproach would be her accidentaly shouting Aoi or injuring herself by overtraining, not running away.Animation:Decent for this kind of anime and consistent, which is the most important thing. Not going too crazy on camera movements nor fluid long shots of movement.Direction:It\'s decent too, but my biggest problem is how it handles dialogues and conversations, making some ackward split of second pauses, like it was a visual novel. Example of this is all the times a character says anything to the main character and he replies with ""shut up"" joking, it just doesn\'t seem fluent nor credible. Aside of that, it has a good rythm and manage to not be boring at any time (trust me, I watched it twice).If you\'re looking for romance, you will probably not find it, at least in this season.

Now, the series does an actual good job into analysing self improvement and has some solid character growth on Tomozaki.', 'O que você quer fazer na sua vida?Sinto pena de quem dropou Tomozaki. Não falo isso com desprezo nem nada do tipo, mas vi várias pessoas sendo afastadas do anime por conta dos primeiros episódios, e que pena. Que pena mesmo. É uma obra tão incrível que o pessoal acabou deixando passar.Mas por que eu acho Tomozaki tão incrível?Vale lembrar que eu li a light novel e posso estar um pouco enviesado,...mas tentarei me manter no anime.Primeiro, é bom dar um contexto geral no anime. Basicamente, temos o protagonista, Fumiya Tomozaki, que é o melhor gamer do Japão num jogo chamado Atafami. Ele possuía um rival online, o segundo melhor gamer, chamado NONAME, e, após derrotá-lo várias vezes, eles marcaram de se encontrar na vida real.Chegando lá, ele descobre que NONAME na verdade é uma mulher chamada Aoi Hinami, que coincidentemente é a garota mais popular da escola do Tomozaki. Ela fica frustrada por ver que o melhor gamer era uma pessoa que desprezava o “jogo da vida” e, após discutirem, a Hinami consegue convencer o Tomozaki de que o “jogo da vida” é um dos melhores jogos existentes, fazendo com que o Tomozaki o experimente.Em outras palavras, o Tomozaki não gosta da vida social e despreza as pessoas populares, mas a Hinami o fez mudar de ideia. E a partir daqui ele começa a melhorar como pessoa, mudando aparência, modo de falar, postura, sendo guiado pela Hinami.Essa é a premissa. Uma pessoa solitária, que não possuía vida social ativa, que desprezava pessoas populares, e que agora está tentando virar uma pessoa popular, está tentando aproveitar a vida.Uma das coisas que mais irritaram as pessoas foi a forma como o anime abordou isso, comparando vida social com jogos. Eu achei ótimo porque realmente faz sentido, mas muitos acharam cringe, e droparam.Dado isso, a pergunta se repete: por que eu acho Tomozaki é incrível?Se eu tivesse que dizer apenas uma coisa, seria o quão bem o autor consegue retratar um ambiente escolar. Já vi alguns slice of life escolares, e nenhum me pareceu tão real quanto Tomozaki.O que me chamou muito a atenção nisso foi análise social que é feita desse ambiente. Relações sociais, hierarquia. O Yaku-sensei tocou em diversos desses pontos, e todos fizeram sentido! Quando eu assisti/li, muita desses pontos eram muito fáceis de ser visualizados na realidade. Eu fazia um “ah, então é por isso que era assim”Por exemplo, a questão do mood e do que é certo e errado. É algo instintivo, e por isso nunca pensamos. Por que será que, numa escola, gostar de anime é errado? Isso é errado, ou é uma construção social? Será que não é que quem é popular não vê anime, e aí criou-se esse pensamento?Não precisa ser só anime, pode ser com qualquer coisa. Quem está no topo dita as regras, e quem tá embaixo respeita. E isso no ambiente escolar é tudo, e nunca vi uma obra tocar nisso. Vocês nunca pensaram nisso? Pensem no cara mais popular na escola de vocês. O que ele fala não é quase sempre verdade? Mas será que é verdade? Ou o mood da sala torna aquilo verdade?Outro exemplo dessa análise é na questão de como conversar. O Tomozaki copiou o estilo do Mizusawa de “provocar” as pessoas para tornar a conversa fluida. E isso funciona pq eu sempre fiz isso kkkkkkkkkkk. Você pega um “problema” que a pessoa tem e brinca com ela sobre. Por exemplo, eu tenho diabetes, então o pessoal me zoava por causa disso. Brincadeira saldável, sem passar dos limites.No anime, brincavam com a Hinami por ela gostar de queijo, ou com a Mimimi ser “airhead”. Esse tópico em específico é abordado mais pra frente na novel, então pararei por aqui.Tem várias outras coisas que posso falar, como conversas no zap, redes sociais, aparência, grupinhos e panelinhas, mas já deu pra notar que o aspecto social é absurdamente bem feito e muito bem estudado, então só por isso já vale a pena conferir.E o que seria do ambiente escolar sem os estudantes, e como cada um se porta?Aqui é onde, na minha opinião, Tomozaki brilha. Como cada pessoa lida com as circunstâncias da vida? Como da pessoa encara os desafios em sua frente? Como cada pessoa pensa sobre isso? Usarei como exemplo alguns personagens.Mimimi. Ela tem um arco apenas pra ela, e é nesse arco que eu me apaixonei por Tomozaki. Ela é caracterizada como uma garota brincalhona que era muito fácil de conversar, que não se abalava com nada. Mas não era bem assim...O conflito interno dela era sobre sempre ser a número 2. É algo bem palpável para muita gente, pois todos somos minimamente competitivos. Todos nós já demos nosso melhor para atingir a liderança, mas nem sempre conseguimos e, pior, nem sempre somos reconhecidos. Mesmo sendo a número 2 em tudo: esportes, atletismo, popularidade, ela quase nunca é lembrada. Sempre lembram da Hinami, mas nunca dela, nunca. Mesmo ela tendo se esforçado. Mesmo ela tendo batalhado para isso. Mesmo ela dando seu máximo. E ninguém lembra. Os holofotes vão para a Hinami.E não é assim na vida real? Quem lembra do vice-campeão de um torneio? Apenas o campeão é lembrado, por mais que o vice-campeão seja um excelente time também!E, uma hora, você se cansa. No caso da Mimimi, ela nunca tentou ativamente confrontar a Hinami. Ela estaca tranquila apenas no 2 lugar, mas uma hora não dá mais para segurar. Você vai, ativamente, tentar ganhar a liderança. E foi o que ela fez: ela se candidatou à presidência do Conselho, junto com a Hinami. É uma postura muito corajosa da Mimimi, porque a adversária é a heroína perfeita. E isso não é algo fácil de se fazer. E tem algo a mais além disso. A Mimimi não mostra que está se forçando, muitas vezes chegando ao ponto de exaustão. E tudo isso porque ela queria derrotar a Hinami.Acabei falando muito da Mimimi, mas ela merece. O Yaku-sensei trabalhou de forma muito madura uma das ansiedades mais presentes nos adolescentes hoje em dia, e eu valorizo muito isso! É muito palpável e compreensível. E a resolução desse conflito é magnífica! Me arrancou algumas lágrimas.Outra personagem que gosto muito é a Izumi. Ela personifica uma mentalidade muito presente nos adolescentes também: a de que só aceita o que é dito. Sabe quando o pessoal na sala vota por alguma coisa, mas você não concorda. E o que você faz? Apenas aceita e não questiona. É exatamente isso que ocorre. A Izumi é o tipo de pessoa que apenas aceita o que é dito, que é levada pelo mood. Eu sou bem parecido com ela na real. É foda você querer falar que não concorda com algo e não falar por medo de ser julgado pelo mood que permeia o ambiente. Acho que todos, uma vez, já passaram por isso.Agora, vou falar sobre 3 personagens pra poder exemplificar o título da minha review: O que você quer fazer na sua vida?Primeiro, Tomozaki. Quem viu o anime, viu como ele mudou absurdamente. O discurso dele contra a Erika é o maior exemplo disso. Ele passou de uma pessoa que odiava o jogo da vida pra alguém que o experimentou e gostou! E a Erika cagou pra isso! Ela personificou a ideia de falar mal de algo que nunca experimentou e negar os esforços das pessoas, e isso enraiveceu o Tomozaki, porque ele é a prova viva de que esforços são capazes de mudança.Ele mudou seguindo as tarefas passadas pela Hinami. Uma delas em específico mexeu com ele, que era a de namorar a Kikuchi. Ele realmente gostava da Kikuchi? Era isso o que ele queria fazer?Esses questionamentos vieram do Mizusawa. Ele era um personagem parecido com a Hinami, de ser “perfeito” e sempre conseguir o que queria. Mas houve um problema: ele gostava da Hinami. E ele se declarou pra ele, e foi rejeitado. Mas ele desistiu? Não. Sendo a primeira vez que ele não conseguia algo, ele tomou a decisão de perseguir seu sonho, de ativamente buscar o que ele queria. E isso mudou o pensamento do TomozakiPorém, isso ia contra os da Hinami. Ela priorizava o pensamento lógico e racional, não se importando com o sentimento das pessoas. Fazer o que você quer? Pffffffft, pra ela isso não existia. Havia apenas um caminho, que era o caminho de sucesso, racional e lógico.Eles discutem e bla bla bla, até o final que é quando o Tomozaki fala pra ele que ele vai provar, que você pode ter sucesso na vida buscando o que você, de fato, quer fazer!E essa é a mensagem que eu tiro de Tomozaki. O que você quer fazer na sua vida? Você quer seguir um caminho que te leve para o sucesso, mesmo negando seus desejos e vontades pessoais? Você quer focar nos seus desejos e não no caminho de sucesso? Você quer tentar ambos?E é isso. Resumindo, Tomozaki é uma ótima representação do ambiente escolar, sendo extremamente fiel ao que o compõe e retratando de forma madura as consequências disso e em como cada estudante é afetado. Não só isso, é uma ótima história que nos ensina que esforço traz resultado, e que só reclamar na cadeira que a vida é ruim não vai adiantar de nada.Então, sim, vale a pena ver Tomozaki e recomendo a todos que vejam. De quebra, vocês podem ir ler a light novel também hehe. mas tentarei me manter no anime.Primeiro, é bom dar um contexto geral no anime.

Brincadeira saldável, sem passar dos limites.No anime, brincavam com a Hinami por ela gostar de queijo, ou com a Mimimi ser “airhead”. Esse tópico em específico é abordado mais pra frente na novel, então pararei por aqui.Tem várias outras coisas que posso falar, como conversas no zap, redes sociais, aparência, grupinhos e panelinhas, mas já deu pra notar que o aspecto social é absurdamente bem feito e muito bem estudado, então só por isso já vale a pena conferir.E o que seria do ambiente escolar sem os estudantes, e como cada um se porta?Aqui é onde, na minha opinião, Tomozaki brilha. Como cada pessoa lida com as circunstâncias da vida? Como da pessoa encara os desafios em sua frente? Como cada pessoa pensa sobre isso? Usarei como exemplo alguns personagens.Mimimi. Ela tem um arco apenas pra ela, e é nesse arco que eu me apaixonei por Tomozaki. Ela é caracterizada como uma garota brincalhona que era muito fácil de conversar, que não se abalava com nada. Mas não era bem assim...O conflito interno dela era sobre sempre ser a número 2. É algo bem palpável para muita gente, pois todos somos minimamente competitivos. Todos nós já demos nosso melhor para atingir a liderança, mas nem sempre conseguimos e, pior, nem sempre somos reconhecidos. Mesmo sendo a número 2 em tudo: esportes, atletismo, popularidade, ela quase nunca é lembrada. Sempre lembram da Hinami, mas nunca dela, nunca. Mesmo ela tendo se esforçado. Mesmo ela tendo batalhado para isso. Mesmo ela dando seu máximo. E ninguém lembra. Os holofotes vão para a Hinami.E não é assim na vida real? Quem lembra do vice-campeão de um torneio? Apenas o campeão é lembrado, por mais que o vice-campeão seja um excelente time também!E, uma hora, você se cansa. No caso da Mimimi, ela nunca tentou ativamente confrontar a Hinami. Ela estaca tranquila apenas no 2 lugar, mas uma hora não dá mais para segurar. Você vai, ativamente, tentar ganhar a liderança. E foi o que ela fez: ela se candidatou à presidência do Conselho, junto com a Hinami. É uma postura muito corajosa da Mimimi, porque a adversária é a heroína perfeita. E isso não é algo fácil de se fazer. E tem algo a mais além disso. A Mimimi não mostra que está se forçando, muitas vezes chegando ao ponto de exaustão. E tudo isso porque ela queria derrotar a Hinami.Acabei falando muito da Mimimi, mas ela merece. O Yaku-sensei trabalhou de forma muito madura uma das ansiedades mais presentes nos adolescentes hoje em dia, e eu valorizo muito isso! É muito palpável e compreensível. E a resolução desse conflito é magnífica! Me arrancou algumas lágrimas.Outra personagem que gosto muito é a Izumi. Ela personifica uma mentalidade muito presente nos adolescentes também: a de que só aceita o que é dito. Sabe quando o pessoal na sala vota por alguma coisa, mas você não concorda. E o que você faz? Apenas aceita e não questiona. É exatamente isso que ocorre. A Izumi é o tipo de pessoa que apenas aceita o que é dito, que é levada pelo mood. Eu sou bem parecido com ela na real. É foda você querer falar que não concorda com algo e não falar por medo de ser julgado pelo mood que permeia o ambiente. Acho que todos, uma vez, já passaram por isso.Agora, vou falar sobre 3 personagens pra poder exemplificar o título da minha review: O que você quer fazer na sua vida?Primeiro, Tomozaki. Quem viu o anime, viu como ele mudou absurdamente. O discurso dele contra a Erika é o maior exemplo disso. Ele passou de uma pessoa que odiava o jogo da vida pra alguém que o experimentou e gostou! E a Erika cagou pra isso! Ela personificou a ideia de falar mal de algo que nunca experimentou e negar os esforços das pessoas, e isso enraiveceu o Tomozaki, porque ele é a prova viva de que esforços são capazes de mudança.Ele mudou seguindo as tarefas passadas pela Hinami. Uma delas em específico mexeu com ele, que era a de namorar a Kikuchi. Ele realmente gostava da Kikuchi? Era isso o que ele queria fazer?Esses questionamentos vieram do Mizusawa. Ele era um personagem parecido com a Hinami, de ser “perfeito” e sempre conseguir o que queria. Mas houve um problema: ele gostava da Hinami. E ele se declarou pra ele, e foi rejeitado. Mas ele desistiu? Não. Sendo a primeira vez que ele não conseguia algo, ele tomou a decisão de perseguir seu sonho, de ativamente buscar o que ele queria. E isso mudou o pensamento do TomozakiPorém, isso ia contra os da Hinami. Ela priorizava o pensamento lógico e racional, não se importando com o sentimento das pessoas. Fazer o que você quer? Pffffffft, pra ela isso não existia. Havia apenas um caminho, que era o caminho de sucesso, racional e lógico.Eles discutem e bla bla bla, até o final que é quando o Tomozaki fala pra ele que ele vai provar, que você pode ter sucesso na vida buscando o que você, de fato, quer fazer!E essa é a mensagem que eu tiro de Tomozaki. O que você quer fazer na sua vida? Você quer seguir um caminho que te leve para o sucesso, mesmo negando seus desejos e vontades pessoais? Você quer focar nos seus desejos e não no caminho de sucesso? Você quer tentar ambos?E é isso. Resumindo, Tomozaki é uma ótima representação do ambiente escolar, sendo extremamente fiel ao que o compõe e retratando de forma madura as consequências disso e em como cada estudante é afetado. Não só isso, é uma ótima história que nos ensina que esforço traz resultado, e que só reclamar na cadeira que a vida é ruim não vai adiantar de nada.Então, sim, vale a pena ver Tomozaki e recomendo a todos que vejam. De quebra, vocês podem ir ler a light novel também hehe.', ""Bottom-Tier Character Tomozakiis an odd one... this anime is not really Romance or RomCom. It's more like a geeky-gamer nerd makeover to try-hard life normie because we do not get much romantic (there are some but only a touch on the surface) and the drama part is not love drama or love triangle, it's more about the gamer's social status (look down or bully).As the title suggested,MC is a GOD in the game but he is a bottom-tier trash loser in real life, while FMC is a perfectionist GOD-tier both in the game and IRL. They met IRL and FMC decided to help MC makeover....However, they see people as objects (or NPCs) and only talk to them to fulfill objectives or missions. This is fine in early EPs, but it is getting weird and awkward after...MC talks to a guy to practice, he dates a girl for EXP, and to get a girlfriend for social status... This is so wrong because he doesn't have interest (or love) in that person. The whole conversation is awkward, not organic, because it's scripted. At least, MC realized this mistake as he progressed (around EP10), otherwise, this would be a trash anime...The quality is... surprisingly good:The art is sharp and clean. The characters are well-drawn, girls are very cute (FMC included). It's not stunningly good but it's plenty good for a seasonal TV anime, there is no poorly drawn scene. Hisako Kanemoto's voice acting is so good here, she can be very harsh or girly at any time. It's like 'Nakiri Erina' is stepping on me when she is harsh. Her girly voice is very charming also.Overall... 7/10I still have 'Mixed Feelings' about 'Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki'. I do not enjoy it as much (yet) since it is hard to watch because of awkward conversations. However, this is not a bad anime, the plot is interesting, the character development is good, and the quality is great also.

Socially inept Tomozaki defines his entire existence around how good he is at Smash Bros--sorry, Attack Families. When he meets up with his gaming nemesis in real life, by pure plot contrivance she turns out to be a girl from his school called Aoi. She's disgusted that this slob is the only person who can beat her at the game, and brow-beats him into sorting his life out. Since gaming is the only language he understands, she formats this as a series of 'missions' that he needs to clear.In terms of her plot function, Aoi could almost...be mistaken for a Manic Pixie Dream-Girl, since so much of her time and energy is devoted to showing the hapless protagonist The Light (TM). MPDGs are normally flawless and endearing though, and this definitely isn't Aoi. Normally, anything stopping a character from being a MPDG would be a good thing, but Aoi is so arrogant, cynical and manipulative that she becomes insufferable. It's sometimes hard to tell if she's meant to be a mentor, love interest, antagonist, or all three.Most of the show follows a decent trajectory, with Tomozaki levelling up his social skills under Aoi's Orwellian control. What's interesting is that as the story progresses, Tomozaki starts to pick holes in Aoi's mechanical way of attacking the Game of Life (not the boardgame).  There's a moment where the story threatens to become really compelling by having him reject her way of thinking and forge his own path, but it ends up lacking the courage to meaningfully break out of its formula and allow Tomozaki to take the reins of his own character arc. Since this is a typical one-cour adaptation of a longer work, we're left with no idea whether he ever will, making for an underwhelming ending that resolves nothing in any meaningful way. be mistaken for a Manic Pixie Dream-Girl, since so much of her time and energy is devoted to showing the hapless protagonist The Light (TM).

There were some cringey characters moments mainly coming from the main character though, but also growth. I think for me this anime has its downfalls in the other main character and their likability as well as rushing...the plot.Story 6So I thought the concept was really interesting. You have this loner high schooler who is the top Japan gamer at not* Super Smash Bros and isn\'t really socialized or has very cynical views (bordering on incelish views) on the way the ""normies"" interact and  how he could never be one. Then comes along another character who is very good at pretty much everything, sports, academics, at the top of her social game, but cannot beat the main character at the game. They meet up, she realizes who she is and decides to help him be socialized through having him see life as a game.Regarding how this story was actually executed felt stunted by the characters and how they were written which I will get into later.  So basically my main view of the story is the story was too rushed which then impacted the characters and how they were written. The writing of characters brought down the story, and we really only got to see the development of the main character, but not really the progression of others. So it was kinda a domino effect here.  Even the ending felt like the payoff needed more, like it just needed a more rounded out arc for multiple characters, especially the second main character.Really the story has the fault of being really rushed, but slow to get to the really hearty moments of the anime.Like I said in my intro the last I think two episodes were where I really enjoyed the show and I wished a lot of the rest of the show was like those last two episodes where we do see heartfelt moments and the result of the main character\'s growth.Art 6I feel like the art was fair, I don\'t think there was anything that really stood out to me about the art in either amazing or awful ways.Sound 6I actually kinda liked both the OP and ED because of how they tried to incorporate gaming into the lyrics, it felt creative. The rest of the soundtrack felt fine.Character 5The main character Fumiya with his first monologue I was like woahhhhh are we on some incel garbage? I was super worried about how it was going to take on this issue, the writing for some of his dialogue felt super cringey, and definitely felt like an older person wrote it.Although I can\'t say I don\'t know people who have felt like that, I think at its core, his feelings are relatable in the way that so many of us have felt like outsiders and unable to fit at some point in our lives. He does express his disdain, and it is a bit overwhelming to hear, it sort of feels a bit like animosity which can be a bit uncomfy and almost giving a school shooter vibe.It was also kinda unfortunate that with every failure, Fumiya would reason that it was occurring because he was a bottom tier character, I say unfortunate because failure is part of life and part of gaming and I think in those moments it would\'ve been cool to see some pushback to his doubts and beliefs that it is just who he is and to even frame it in gaming.I do know though that in general it is pretty realistic for one to internalize failure, and that is basically what he was doing.I liked that in his growth we see his develop care for being genuine and authentic, and as I put in my criticism of Aoi, I wished we could\'ve seen more pushback to her on pushing him to complete the tasks and goals regardless of how disingenuous the action would\'ve been for Fumiya, or regardless of how much he truly wanted to do that goal. I like that we see him still awkward even as he is getting more and more used to his interactions, I also kind of wished we got to see him actually enjoying being around people instead of solely viewing the stuff he was doing as the tasks to complete and then reporting it back to Aoi. Like it would\'ve been cool to see him do more and more social interactions on his own and because he wanted to.Throughout the show, we see the second main character Aoi or Noname(her gamer tag on Tackfam) guiding him through social challenges to help him socialize.She was not super likeable, first off why does she help him, that is never really answered, like if they are going for she helps him because of her wanting to live up to the expectations of Nanashi (his gamer tag) then it could\'ve been expressed a bit better, because I feel like I spent so much of the anime like, ""dude why are you helping him?"" Like there is no really hint that they would be romantic with each other, especially with how she criticizes him in their first meeting as Nanashi and Noname. Also there is the argument that they are friends, never does she ever really treat him like a friend, the only times we see them interact is for Fumiya reporting on his tasks and progress and when she is around while Fumiya is doing his tasks. She treats him as a project.Second off she is so mean to him, like yes does he have stuff to work on, and some of the stuff she criticizes him for are true, BUT she does it in such a harsh and demeaning way. With the way she talks down to him in such a cutting way it makes her come across as just like she doesn\'t actually want him to succeed.You can give constructive criticism while also being genuinely encouraging, but truly she never really is encouraging without also being incredibly cruel. Also noting she has this arrogance about her, as though the way she perceives the world is absolute, towards the end, she casts Fumiya as a loser and a coward when he actively refuses to force a confession when he is trying to avoid being disingenuous and trying to figure out what he ""truly"" wants.In that she is a hypocrite, because she herself cannot face herself for who she is and is wearing a mask, and I get that this is a flaw of hers, but it is only pointed out towards the very end of the anime. Throughout the anime, she is treated like this untouchable being, and I will acknowledge I absolutely know people like this who always have their mask on and there are for sure people who\'s mask is being that all around good at everything person.Fumiya does point out and question her a few times throughout the show regarding her suggestions being inauthentic and seem deceptive and she writes him off.Now I think she gave him some legitimate advice, because we do actively see Fumiya grow, but he is also doing reflecting over what she is asking of him, but I would\'ve been so interested to see him give her more pushback and both of them realizing where they are wrong in their perspectives and both growing. Like I believe this occurring for both would\'ve provided a satisfying arc.She is also incredibly push on what she deems what will give him the growth he needs, despite not showing her having had the same things, like a part time job, does she have that or experience, a girlfriend, where is her partner? Like to an extent she does explain why each task can be helpful, but she also doesn\'t back really why she believes this is crucial to experiencing high school.Like yes in so much media about high school it is about getting the guy or girl, or being popular so maybe it doesn\'t need to be explicitly stated why it is productive to the high school experience (which it seems like so many stories are trying to actively get away from and not make that the main focal point of the story and focus more on individual characters), and at the same time not everyone needs the same thing to enjoy high school, not everything needs to revolve around dating, one can learn to be more social without having to date, one can get the high school experience without having to date. None of this is to say that there is anything wrong with wanting a partner either. In this anime, the goals just didn\'t feel introduced naturally.Regarding Mimimi and Tama.I think it was really cool to see Mimimi wanting to help Tama socialize and that was cool to see AT FIRST.....BUT Mimimi actively sexually harasses Tama and occasionally Aoi, and this is played off as a joke.....yeah I wasn\'t really down with that. It was uncomfortable as hell. It is even said that Mimimi was no longer really competing with Aoi, but her harassment of Tama increased by like three times....and that\'s okay?!!Fuka-So I thought her character was cute and she did act as way for Fumiya to further develop and she did play a role in his development, BUT her character was pretty hollow and surface level. Like she didn\'t feel like her own character, she really did just feel like exactly what I said, written only for Fumiya\'s progress, like her whole character is writing and observing others to help writing, and liking this one author...how stereotypical can you get and base level character, like she deserved more depth.I would\'ve loved to see him make more progress in their relationship and see it naturally progress and get to know her more. Like maybe we find that they are better off as friends, and that is okay, or maybe they do end up together.Takahiro and ShujiKinda forgettable, it was cool to see Fumiya and Takahiro get close and bond though.Yuzu-Also kind of forgettable, was there to help Fumiya socialize and as a potential romantic interest, but then it ended up she was interested in Shuji and her arc was interest in Shuji and the rest of the characters trying to set them up. After Fumiya helped her with a birthday present, her character kind of faded out, and was only there a bit.ConclusionWhew, so after all of that I\'d say overall the anime is fine, those heartfelt ending moments I wish were more throughout the anime.I wouldn\'t say this is a complete throwaway anime, but if you are watching be prepared for a rushed story while also being slow to get to the best moments, and also in my opinion a dislikeable second main character, also an at first very cringey main character.If you don\'t watch it, you won\'t miss out on too much and if you feel like you are short on patience I would not recommend this anime. Overall it was fine, nothing great, nothing horrendous. the plot.Story 6So I thought the concept was really interesting.

Even the ending felt like the payoff needed more, like it just needed a more rounded out arc for multiple characters, especially the second main character.Really the story has the fault of being really rushed, but slow to get to the really hearty moments of the anime.Like I said in my intro the last I think two episodes were where I really enjoyed the show and I wished a lot of the rest of the show was like those last two episodes where we do see heartfelt moments and the result of the main character\'s growth.Art 6I feel like the art was fair, I don\'t think there was anything that really stood out to me about the art in either amazing or awful ways.Sound 6I actually kinda liked both the OP and ED because of how they tried to incorporate gaming into the lyrics, it felt creative. The rest of the soundtrack felt fine.Character 5The main character Fumiya with his first monologue I was like woahhhhh are we on some incel garbage? I was super worried about how it was going to take on this issue, the writing for some of his dialogue felt super cringey, and definitely felt like an older person wrote it.Although I can\'t say I don\'t know people who have felt like that, I think at its core, his feelings are relatable in the way that so many of us have felt like outsiders and unable to fit at some point in our lives. He does express his disdain, and it is a bit overwhelming to hear, it sort of feels a bit like animosity which can be a bit uncomfy and almost giving a school shooter vibe.It was also kinda unfortunate that with every failure, Fumiya would reason that it was occurring because he was a bottom tier character, I say unfortunate because failure is part of life and part of gaming and I think in those moments it would\'ve been cool to see some pushback to his doubts and beliefs that it is just who he is and to even frame it in gaming.I do know though that in general it is pretty realistic for one to internalize failure, and that is basically what he was doing.I liked that in his growth we see his develop care for being genuine and authentic, and as I put in my criticism of Aoi, I wished we could\'ve seen more pushback to her on pushing him to complete the tasks and goals regardless of how disingenuous the action would\'ve been for Fumiya, or regardless of how much he truly wanted to do that goal. I like that we see him still awkward even as he is getting more and more used to his interactions, I also kind of wished we got to see him actually enjoying being around people instead of solely viewing the stuff he was doing as the tasks to complete and then reporting it back to Aoi. Like it would\'ve been cool to see him do more and more social interactions on his own and because he wanted to.Throughout the show, we see the second main character Aoi or Noname(her gamer tag on Tackfam) guiding him through social challenges to help him socialize.She was not super likeable, first off why does she help him, that is never really answered, like if they are going for she helps him because of her wanting to live up to the expectations of Nanashi (his gamer tag) then it could\'ve been expressed a bit better, because I feel like I spent so much of the anime like, ""dude why are you helping him?"" Like there is no really hint that they would be romantic with each other, especially with how she criticizes him in their first meeting as Nanashi and Noname. Also there is the argument that they are friends, never does she ever really treat him like a friend, the only times we see them interact is for Fumiya reporting on his tasks and progress and when she is around while Fumiya is doing his tasks. She treats him as a project.Second off she is so mean to him, like yes does he have stuff to work on, and some of the stuff she criticizes him for are true, BUT she does it in such a harsh and demeaning way. With the way she talks down to him in such a cutting way it makes her come across as just like she doesn\'t actually want him to succeed.You can give constructive criticism while also being genuinely encouraging, but truly she never really is encouraging without also being incredibly cruel. Also noting she has this arrogance about her, as though the way she perceives the world is absolute, towards the end, she casts Fumiya as a loser and a coward when he actively refuses to force a confession when he is trying to avoid being disingenuous and trying to figure out what he ""truly"" wants.In that she is a hypocrite, because she herself cannot face herself for who she is and is wearing a mask, and I get that this is a flaw of hers, but it is only pointed out towards the very end of the anime. Throughout the anime, she is treated like this untouchable being, and I will acknowledge I absolutely know people like this who always have their mask on and there are for sure people who\'s mask is being that all around good at everything person.Fumiya does point out and question her a few times throughout the show regarding her suggestions being inauthentic and seem deceptive and she writes him off.Now I think she gave him some legitimate advice, because we do actively see Fumiya grow, but he is also doing reflecting over what she is asking of him, but I would\'ve been so interested to see him give her more pushback and both of them realizing where they are wrong in their perspectives and both growing. Like I believe this occurring for both would\'ve provided a satisfying arc.She is also incredibly push on what she deems what will give him the growth he needs, despite not showing her having had the same things, like a part time job, does she have that or experience, a girlfriend, where is her partner? Like to an extent she does explain why each task can be helpful, but she also doesn\'t back really why she believes this is crucial to experiencing high school.Like yes in so much media about high school it is about getting the guy or girl, or being popular so maybe it doesn\'t need to be explicitly stated why it is productive to the high school experience (which it seems like so many stories are trying to actively get away from and not make that the main focal point of the story and focus more on individual characters), and at the same time not everyone needs the same thing to enjoy high school, not everything needs to revolve around dating, one can learn to be more social without having to date, one can get the high school experience without having to date. None of this is to say that there is anything wrong with wanting a partner either. In this anime, the goals just didn\'t feel introduced naturally.Regarding Mimimi and Tama.I think it was really cool to see Mimimi wanting to help Tama socialize and that was cool to see AT FIRST.....BUT Mimimi actively sexually harasses Tama and occasionally Aoi, and this is played off as a joke.....yeah I wasn\'t really down with that. It was uncomfortable as hell. It is even said that Mimimi was no longer really competing with Aoi, but her harassment of Tama increased by like three times....and that\'s okay?!!Fuka-So I thought her character was cute and she did act as way for Fumiya to further develop and she did play a role in his development, BUT her character was pretty hollow and surface level. Like she didn\'t feel like her own character, she really did just feel like exactly what I said, written only for Fumiya\'s progress, like her whole character is writing and observing others to help writing, and liking this one author...how stereotypical can you get and base level character, like she deserved more depth.I would\'ve loved to see him make more progress in their relationship and see it naturally progress and get to know her more. Like maybe we find that they are better off as friends, and that is okay, or maybe they do end up together.Takahiro and ShujiKinda forgettable, it was cool to see Fumiya and Takahiro get close and bond though.Yuzu-Also kind of forgettable, was there to help Fumiya socialize and as a potential romantic interest, but then it ended up she was interested in Shuji and her arc was interest in Shuji and the rest of the characters trying to set them up. After Fumiya helped her with a birthday present, her character kind of faded out, and was only there a bit.ConclusionWhew, so after all of that I\'d say overall the anime is fine, those heartfelt ending moments I wish were more throughout the anime.I wouldn\'t say this is a complete throwaway anime, but if you are watching be prepared for a rushed story while also being slow to get to the best moments, and also in my opinion a dislikeable second main character, also an at first very cringey main character.If you don\'t watch it, you won\'t miss out on too much and if you feel like you are short on patience I would not recommend this anime. Overall it was fine, nothing great, nothing horrendous.', 'Boy am I glad they didn\'t drop the ball in the finale. While at a glance, the show has no outstanding qualities (both good or bad), it does have one edge over the competition:It actually has message plenty of people should take to heart. While it\'s packaged in this (sometimes cringe-iducing) ""seeing life as a game"" package, a message of self-improvement and living life to its fullest is very much appreciated within the realm of anime, which far too often even goes so far as to defend the typical hedonistic NEET lifestyle or are fraught with self-pity, never realizing that people are often their own...worst enemies.The cast are not too nuanced but are all portrayed as actual humans, which can\'t be said of plenty other shows.This show was well made, well played and actually had a worthwhile thing to say.

Pinning down all the heads of this hydra is quite tricky, because I'm not quite sure where to even begin.  For a tl;dr just skip to the end, but if you're actually thinking about watching this, I'll lay out the foremost of my thoughts.I guess the best place to start is with the first episode, because this is absolutely going to be the biggest barrier.  This first episode is where I'd say 95% of the people who drop it will drop it.  The first episode starts by sucking the skin off Super Smash...Bros' dick (Ultimate, specifically) but as cringe as all that is, it's peanuts compared to what comes next.  Tomozaki's worldview at this point is that of an insular, jaded loner.  He's got nothing going for him but being a smash gremlin and shunning the rest of the world.  Quite frankly, he's a boo-hoo beta bitch boy.  Through convenient light-novel happenstance, he is face to face with the most popular girl in his school who's also actually his gaming rival and they argue about SOCIETY.  The problem here, the thing that is going to turn off and probably already lost many people who watched it, is that the show makes absolutely no attempt to separate its viewpoint from that of Tomozaki's.  There is no assurance that the show doesn't necessarily endorse Tomozaki's outlook, there's nothing to let you as the audience know that what the character is arguing ISN'T the position the show will take and try to justify over the next 11 episodes.  Because for the bulk of this first episode, the only perspective of weight you're shown is that of the MC, through inner monologue and uninterrupted tirades against antagonistic characters.  There is little done to humble the protagonist, to balance his perspective with self-reflection or other voices of equal weight, to make it less serious and absolute than it comes across as, and without any assurance of what you are watching being self-aware, this can easily lead you to take this as the show's and protagonist's viewpoints being synonymous.  It's not until the very end of the episode where his perspective is meaningfully challenged, and literally from this point out, it's not really like it was before.  There's more self-awareness, more dialogue, and more exploration from episode 2 onward (more or less, it's not exactly the deepest) and the protagonist is never again that much of a complete sniveling loser.  So this first episode does a terrible job of ushering you in and laying out what the show is gonna be like, but if you can make it past this first stumbling block, it's honestly a far cry from what you see here.Well, okay first let's get something else out of the way: the cosmic background cringe.  The video game analogies and constant smash fellating will be omnipresent, they never go away, but they're also very easy to let roll off your back.  They're cringe, they're lame, the whole LIFE IS LIKE A VIDEO GAME shit is here to stay, but it's not enough to repel a champ like you if you made it through the first episode. Good job champ.  Now I won't bring it up again, but it's there the whole time, so just get used to it.There isn't really anything especially noteworthy until episode 4 when there's another giga-cringe moment.  Without getting too much into it, he basically wins new friends by REEEEEing a popular girl who called smash gay.After this point though, the MC overnight chills out and stops being a sperg.  From this point in the show onward, the show is basically standard romcomdram fare.  There's one more particular moment I need to address, but for the most part, from episode 2 onward, it is coloring inside the genre lines.  If you like this kind of stuff, if you want your light novel high school vicarious do-over, here it is.  The show is extremely derivative of Oregairu, and whether you've seen it or not, it's still going to feel familiar to you.  It's just very safe, formulaic, by the numbers, but adequate enough.  If you read the synopsis, read this review, and made it through episode 1, I think it's safe to say you'll find it serviceable.  Maybe even you'll find the later developments slightly more compelling than the bare minimum.  I honestly started coming around to it in the last 3 or 4.But speaking of that, I have to mention that particular moment.  I couldn't NOT.  This show, this genre really, is pretty indulgent wish fulfillment, but even then, what I'm about to mention is on a whole 'nother level.  THE GANG is out on a camping trip and the boys bond by... comparing pen0rs.  And of course, for your wish fulfillment fantasy, your self-insert can't be anything less than hung right?  That's right, they felt it necessary to make the MC packing and everyone in the story know, and there are callbacks to this later (in passing but still.)  Maybe you don't think it's that big of a deal, maybe this says something about me, but I'd wager most people will at the very least raise an eyebrow when they get to this part, if not do what I did and clutch my shoulders and writhe in cringe at the audacity to include this.There's more I could say critical of the story or the themes or the characters or the drama or this and that and the other but the long and short of it is that this is your highschool romcomdram slop with extra heapings of cringe on top.  Maybe you're like me and get a kick out of the agony and ecstasy of high-quality cringe, left gobsmacked by the bizarre unfiltered discomfort and savoring the eons it feels like for it to pass.  Maybe you don't give a shit and can stomach it just fine.  Maybe you think it's not cringe at all (hate to tell you what that means about you then tho.)  Whatever the case, I think if you just trust me that it only gets as bad as the first episode and that the MC's bitch boy attitude is intentional, then afterward you'll find a tolerable experience.

There are numerous Dragon Ball Z movies out there that are pretty bad or left me feeling it could of been better, but let me tell you that the Bojack movie is not one of those Bio-Broly failures. The movie started out with the richest guy in the world offering a huge sum of money to whoever can win his global tournament and then get the honor of facing the world champion...Hercule.

The man is built like a machine in terms of muscle or in Dragon Ball Z terms Broly. The fight between Bojack and the Z fighters was an interesting one to watch unfold and ended in a way I saw coming, but still a good watch. I'd hate to spoil the rest for you so I guess I'll leave it up to you guys and gals to watch it yourself!Arrgh! Hercule.

He's the 2nd strongest main character (for me) but everytime or even when Goku is dead, there was someone in his heritage would always defeat the enemy/ies, for example Gohan. Goku found out that a half saiyan-half earthling is stronger than pure blood saiyan but Trunks was also a half saiyan-earthling but...why is he appears to be weaker or it seems to be tahn Gohan in this movie.

It does have the problem of characters not fully powering up at the start of a fight, in order to create some artificial drama. But all of the dragon ball movies have that problem. I kind of like the flow of this movie better than a lot of them though. Starts off with a tournament that eventually goes awry because some villains show up. A lot of the comedy here works surprisingly well, better than most of the movies.Art & Sound:The art is fantastic for something from 1993....Period.The sound is good, but I prefer the Falconer replacement, and unfortunately this movie has very little (none?) of that. Regardless, I still enjoyed what it had, especially the climax.Characters:And now the characters, which are the best part. The villains for this one are great, among the series best. Their designs are fantastic. The second biggest thing is Gohan is the protagonist in this one. I love Gohan and that's a big part of that. However even if you prefer Goku as a character, at the very least Gohan being the main character makes for a different change of pace. Literally every other villain and movie as well as later entries GT and Super and the prequel Dragonball have Goku defeating the main villain. It's so cool seeing someone else- someone far more interesting at that- take down the main villain for a change. This movie is a good throwback to the Cell saga of the series, which is the best arc.Enjoyment & Overall:This is my favorite DBZ movie, and it's not hard to see why.A lot of the comedy works surprising well, the art is fantastic for something that aired in 1993, the villains are among the best the series has to offer, and Gohan rightfully gets the spotlight as the protagonist.Overall: 8/10 Period.The sound is good, but I prefer the Falconer replacement, and unfortunately this movie has very little (none?) of that.

For the sake of this review, Bojack: Unbound will be rated, assuming that those who have watched this movie, are up to date with the T.V show.Not to point out the obvious, but I think that it goes without say that anything dragon ball Z (T.V series) related, will not be taken into consideration when writing this review, as this is only a small branch taken out of the dragon ball franchise. This means that the timeline, and characters in the movie should be...already understood by the viewer, assuming that they are up to date.Characters: All main characters from the cell arc (previous season of the show) are apparent, all of them fill out their purpose appropriately in the movie, and all of their power levels are around the same as of the T.V show. NA/10oh yeah, and Mr Satan is in this one too :) yayStory: This is your basic dragon ball Z movie plot. It carries out for 50 minutes, does EXACTLY what it intends to do. Worlds martial arts tournament, bad guys at the tournament, tournament put on hold, 9/10 of the characters are defeated by the bad guys, and 1 character beats the bad guys. Simple, nothing wrong with this, wont really be taking into account. As a genuine plot? a 5/10. But because there\'s no room for an ACTUAL plot, the rating is NA/10.Art: The art is, good. Really good. The worlds martial arts tournament, is COMPLETELY revamped into the so-called ""Intergalactic World Tournament"", and looks COOL for once. Everything about the setting in the movie, is indifferent to every other movie in the series, despite the old and recurring plot and ideas used in every one of them. Toei animation\'s clear intent was to make something dark. Something gritty, something refreshing for the viewers, and they definitely pulled it off. There\'s blood coming out of each character, choking, screaming, and while this is all happening, you can feel the sheer agony of each character who are going through these things, all throughout the look in their faces. When the battle TRULY begins, the environments placed in each fight, are dark, poorly lit, gross, weird, creepy, black.Sound: The OST is pretty damn good. When the first half of the show is underway, its fun, is wacky, its suitable to the current situation at hand. Characters are having fun, gohan and krillin are fighting in the tournament, and Master Roshi is back at it, indulging in his daily little perverted acts. Essentially its all fun and games, but when the real battle between gohan, Bojack and his crew begins, the OST becomes... disturbing... You can literally feel the gravity of the situation. It\'s the first time any long itme dbz fan will ever be able to think with a worried look on their face, ""shit, everyones actually going to be f*cking murdered..."" without some goofy ass music playing in the background (T.V show)Sound pt 2: The voice acting of goku and gohan in this movie are incredible. When gohan is being strangled by bojack, he screams. But this time, with goku in other world, and everyone else essentially dead, no one can help him. When paired up with the brilliant OST of this movie, this sh*t is almost goddamn disturbing... When watching this scene for the 7th f*cking time, I couldn\'t help but get goosebumps.The next scene where Goku comes down from other world to save gohan, is also very well acted out. Goku gets mad. He actually gets mad at something....well done Sean Schemmel, great job.Extra: For once, when the characters in the movie are shown to laugh, it actually...seems...genuine.Enjoyment: Im biased, but I do not care, this shit makes me FEEEL good bruh. The way the characters talk to each other just.. make me feel happy. The first half of the show, sets the ending up real nice, so I never need to ask, ""wtf is going on???!?!?"". The main things that make this movie great for ME, is the great voice acting paired with the even greater OST towards the end of the film. 10/10This movie isn\'t a masterpiece, it literally cant be (as a standalone movie). But for all dragon ball z fans who have an itch for edginess, this movie can be enjoyed to the max. already understood by the viewer, assuming that they are up to date.Characters: All main characters from the cell arc (previous season of the show) are apparent, all of them fill out their purpose appropriately in the movie, and all of their power levels are around the same as of the T.V show.

But for all dragon ball z fans who have an itch for edginess, this movie can be enjoyed to the max.', 'Dragon Ball Z Movie 9 Bojack Unbound takes place shortly after the defeat of Cell, and is one of few movies that can fit into the main story. To celebrate the birthday of his son, Mr Money holds a tournament where the winner can challenge Mr Satan. However, your average space invader appears to ruin everything. It is up to the Z fighters to stop them and safe Earth.This movie is one of few where Yamcha and Tenshinhan take part in and the film does a good job utilizing them especially during the tournament part. The movie uses humor in a good way too especially...with the scene with Yamcha who like usual gets humiliated, but not in a disrespectful way. While Tenshinhan had an impressive showing fighting a Super Saiyan tier opponent respecting his strength.Even when facing opponents far above their level, them appearing to help Gohan show bravery and courage.Speaking of Gohan, this movie is basically taking advantage of the latest transformation introduced in Dragon Ball: Super Saiyan Grade 5 aka. Super Saiyan 2 and it is about Gohan taping into that power once again to save everyone. And how the movie did it, was not insulting by nerving Gohan for the billions of time as he happened to be the most powerful fighter of all the Z warriors even before taking that form. Most importantly, it was Toei\'s take on how taking the torch from Goku affected Gohan as now he grew from apprentice to master and from a protected to a protector. Showing that he took his father role as earth savoir.The movie also has Piccolo and Vegeta with their own unique issues. Piccolo desiring to fight a worthy opponent that takes him serious and isn\'t boring him to death. Vegeta has given up on fighting since Trunks was killed temporary and Goku left earth. In this movie, he has to find the courage to get his fighting instincts back once again. It is not the best thing the movies have done as Movie 6, 8 and 12 have used Vegeta far better, but it is something that make him feel more than a character who just appears for fan service.The antagonists in this movie are also unique. They belong to the same race making it more believable they know similar techniques and have similar abilities as some use a unique transformation giving a fitting design that stands out in the environment they are fighting.Speaking of environment, since the tournament is founded by a family with too much money, there stages created are all unique. Since the villains don\'t care about the tournament itself, the locations happen to change often when they smash the Z fighters somewhere else. Examples as such are: a flowery field, a place with hot lava, a desert and even a town that looks like Central Europe at night.Generally the movie did a good job taking advantage of ""show don\'t tell"" which many modern anime can\'t do and would rather infodumb to explain the things you see.A criticism about this movie is the appearance of Future Trunks which makes it questionable why he is still around instead of staying in his timeline since he is the only one who can protect it. However, the movie didn\'t waste him as it used him well to show that he grow past the need to use his sword by defeating a powerful sword user himself. Not to mention him reacting to his father getting his fighting spirit back which could only be effective when someone like Trunks witnessed it. Then again, swords in Dragon Ball since the defeat of Raditz should not even be needed unless they provide a specific purpose like when Janemba in Fusion Reborn used it.Also while Vegeta got his character arc, he still feels like a character who is there just because since neither he nor Piccolo mattered to this movie and their accomplishment meant nothing overall.Lastly Bojack himself. He used to be sealed by the 5 Kaios and the death of one undid one of the seals which was enough to free him, which gives some insight and justification for his power, but that doesn\'t explain why he is so powerful to begin with. The movie never elaborated on his race which is weird since his henchmen belong to the same race. It would be nice to know if they happen to be the strongest of their race or if they are relatives. Did they chose to leave their homeworld willingly or where they banished? Anything to grasp on would have been useful to flesh them out. Even something about their transformation would have been nice. Not to mention, Bojack coming to earth is also not explained well. The only interesting thing about Bojack is that he is the only villain who gangs up on his prey and doesn\'t usually fight a one on one fight.In conclusion, Bojack Unbound is a fine movie with a rather unmemorable villain. It uses the underused characters well but most are just here for fan service. Regardless, if you are a Dragon Ball Z fan you are going to enjoy this movie. Especially if you are a Gohan fan as this movie gives Gohan the most respect of all Dragon Ball movies does far including Dragon Ball Super Super Heroes. with the scene with Yamcha who like usual gets humiliated, but not in a disrespectful way.

Especially if you are a Gohan fan as this movie gives Gohan the most respect of all Dragon Ball movies does far including Dragon Ball Super Super Heroes.', 'Bojack: Unbound is the ninth movie in the long running Dragon Ball Z series, and I have to say it\'s not only among my most hated movies in the franchise, but also in the anime genre altogether. Even for a DBZ movie, there is no imagination or any attempt whatsoever to at least make the already beaten path the least bit tolerable. It\'s so by the numbers that after watching the first eight movies, you can actually create a checklist and start marking off plot related elements as you go.After a few very boring fights and mind-numbingly lame comedy; Trunks, Gohan, and Krillin advance...in the tournament and leave for a new area to continue fighting. From there they meet Bojack, his minions, and then several brawls occur. DBZ is an all out action anime, this is something we all know and there\'s nothing wrong with that. However, this movie is just way too by the numbers and very bland. The side characters are nothing but bodies to be dominated. They make very dramatic appearances as if they\'re going to actually pose a threat, yet they\'re beaten quicker than they show up. If a new viewer came into this movie first, I can\'t imagine them wanting to delve deeper because no one comes off looking like a bad ass at all. Bojack and his gang are nothing but cookie cutter baddies with about as much personality as a pimple between them all.This movie takes place after Goku\'s death which occurred during the Cell Saga, and his son Gohan arose as Earth\'s new protector. Instead of developing him in that way, he comes off needing support from his dead father. There was so much potential to develop the entire cast as a team, plus mentor Gohan along the way. Instead, they clearly find a way to cram Goku into it, thus proving there was no way the show could have possibly survived without him. Many fans believe that this movie can actually fit in the DBZ main continuity in between the Cell Games Saga and The Great Saiyaman. Well, without nitpicking in the characters dialog it actually can; but that\'s not a reason to praise this movie.While the backgrounds have moments of looking very good, from the peaceful looking prairies, to the dark and menacing ruins in the battle ground. The animation unfortunately is the usual reused-cels found in the DBZ series. In other words, very quick, blurred motions passing off as action, the laziest path to take when it comes down to delivering action scenes. There really isn\'t much choreography, as there\'s a heavy reliance on a light show. While plenty of the explosions and energy attacks look nice, the actual fighting has always failed to register with me. Up to this day I still haven\'t heard the sub, and I have no desire to. However, the dub is pretty good with the usual suspects featuring Chris Sabat playing both Piccolo and Vegeta, along with Eric Vale as Trunks; and please don\'t come into this expecting the fun rock scores you heard in Cooler\'s Revenge or Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan. Instead, what you get here is something mums will use to put the kids to sleep.Everything about this movie screams ""lazy money draining succubus"". If someone told me it took Toei Animation 10 minutes to come up with this movie, it would be lies to me and I\'ll swear it took less. In closing, this movie is only for Dragon Ball Z fans. Everyone else do yourself a favor and avoid it. If you\'re looking for a fun anime feature minus the psycho-babble, Redline or even Read or Die would make better choices. If you want something with a deep storyline that doesn\'t run for 10 hours, Area 88 OVA will be a great choice. Skip this 50 minute waste of time.Highs: Makes great anime look greaterLows: Slapped together boring and cliché story in the tournament and leave for a new area to continue fighting.

This part is great. You know the entire time that it's gonna get ruined by a boring fight scene with boring villains, but it's great while it lasts.Like with Broly, the very fact it mixes...up the formula makes it a whole lot more interesting than usual. Yeah, it still devolves into mindless fighting, but the stakes are more fun when you know Goku can't save the day (mostly). There's a couple REALLY iffy moments in the climax though that hurt the movie significantly. With just a bit of editing this coulda been great.Like the first Cooler movie, this actually fits perfectly in the timeline with no issues. It might even enhance the main series by being included, unlike Cooler. It's a darn fine Dragon Ball movie, even if it's not much of a movie-movie. up the formula makes it a whole lot more interesting than usual.

However, I am not telling anyone because I think he won\'t go after the Earth.Every anime has its qualities that should be praised. There aren\'t anime that should deserve 1 or 2/10 or even 3/10, but these movies keep breaking me with their absurdness, with their zero logic. Yes, it is non-canon. But, I expect from the DBZ franchise, the franchise that gave us villains like Frieza and Cell and memorable moments like Super Saiyan 1 and 2 and Majin Vegeta and some great plot twists, cool scenes, smart outplays, and many more moments...to hold up some standard. Yet, some of these movies are such a pain.Anyway, let\'s move onto the review. As I mentioned DBZ movie: Bojack Unbound is a non-canon movie. He does not appear in the manga.\\\\spoiler alert just in case//My positives from BU:Art and sound in DBZ coat, that\'s it.What could have been a positive:If this movie was a tournament solely, it could have been great fun to see other than Goku characters fight it out and be the spotlight of this movie, but sadly not. The movie went straight to hell.My negative from BU:1, Why is Future Trunks even here? He should already be in his timeline fixing the Android mess, his only reason to even be in this movie is to add a cool factor, or I don\'t know. He kills one enemy, defeats Tien and then gets destroyed and does nothing for the rest of the movie.2, Why Vegeta isn\'t here? At the start of BU, we hear he\'s not in the mood for a fight. Well, I\'ll tell you why he\'s not here. Because of the plot. We have Vegeta killing the Bojack pawns. Because this movie would have been over way sooner. Once he finally shows up on the battlefield, he does nothing and gets taken out by Bojack, wow.3, Why Piccolo forfeited the tournament? Did he sensed something or what? I don\'t know anymore, he ""fights"" with Kuririn, Kuririn almost fell into the sea, Piccolo saved him, forfeited the match and he shows up to save Gohan, well he saves him, but guess what, after that Piccolo gets destroyed. Same as Vegeta, Piccolo kills none of Bojack\'s minions, of course.4, Roshi\'s hentai moments: Just stop. I like Master Roshi and his perversion, but are these moments in the movie really necessary? It adds nothing, it only delays main events.5, It takes almost half an hour for us to finally see Bojack: I think this movie was supposed to be a tournament, but then someone had the bright idea to do a tournament ""gone wrong"" plot because we have never seen those in Dragon Ball.6, Bojack ""backstory"" is absolute bullshit. He was sealed by 4 Kai\'s. Ok, I can take it. After the destruction of King Kai\'s planet seal has been broken, ok that sounds fine, so what did you do? Nothing. What? Why? Because I thought he won\'t go after the Earth. This is absolute shit. This is a trash excuse of a backstory. Threat to the universe escape and you do nothing. Wow.7, The worst fights in the 1st 9 DBZ movies. Z fighters get taken out instantly. No enjoyment value at all. Vegeta gets destroyed within the 1st minute of his fight. What is that? Either you are Gohan, or you can\'t do anything beneficial.8, Why didn\'t Vegeta kill the minions 1st: Vegeta is a smart warrior, he proved that on Namek, when he took out Zarbon and Dodoria and fought Ginyu Force before he went to face Frieza, but here Vegeta goes straight for the villain, just to be defeated, as a result from this movie trying to be thrilling, it does not work, Super Saiyan can take out Bojack\'s minion, so why didn\'t he do it and then go against Bojack with numbers advantage? Because of the plot.9, Bojack went for the Earth because it is the most beautiful planet: This might even better plot device than the plot device from Broly movie (Goku\'s crying). This is so dumb of a reason. He goes for Earth, because of its beauty? Just to destroy it, wtf?10, Goku saves the day, again: I am just gonna ignore the fact, he was able to even hit Bojack, because that would take way more time. Gohan cannot achieve Super Saiyan 2, even when he sees all his friends defeated. Nope, it has to be Goku (who\'s dead) to be the hero, as always. I love Goku, but these non-canon movies could have shown other Z warrior being the hero for once, but nope.11, The end, Satan is the newspaper hero, that\'s fine, but one last negative, why was this competition even a thing and why Bojack attacked through this competition. He only says, he likes Earth. He never reveals, why he appeared in the tournament. Well, it is again because of the plot. This way was the only way to separate Z warrior, so they get defeated in pathetic order to make any sense for this movie.Summary: This is the worst DBZ movie in the 1st nine movies. It even bests ""The world\'s strongest"". It ultimately makes everyone except Gohan, Goku and Trunks that one time useless. I hate it because it\'s lazy, dull and boring.As for that, I award Dragon Ball Movie Z 09: Bojack Unbound with 3/10 and I cannot recommend you this movie in any possible way. It\'s garbage. Watch it only if you are doing 100% DB run or 100% rerun. to hold up some standard. Yet, some of these movies are such a pain.Anyway, let\'s move onto the review.

I don\'t know anymore, he ""fights"" with Kuririn, Kuririn almost fell into the sea, Piccolo saved him, forfeited the match and he shows up to save Gohan, well he saves him, but guess what, after that Piccolo gets destroyed. Same as Vegeta, Piccolo kills none of Bojack\'s minions, of course.4, Roshi\'s hentai moments: Just stop. I like Master Roshi and his perversion, but are these moments in the movie really necessary? It adds nothing, it only delays main events.5, It takes almost half an hour for us to finally see Bojack: I think this movie was supposed to be a tournament, but then someone had the bright idea to do a tournament ""gone wrong"" plot because we have never seen those in Dragon Ball.6, Bojack ""backstory"" is absolute bullshit. He was sealed by 4 Kai\'s. Ok, I can take it. After the destruction of King Kai\'s planet seal has been broken, ok that sounds fine, so what did you do? Nothing. What? Why? Because I thought he won\'t go after the Earth. This is absolute shit. This is a trash excuse of a backstory. Threat to the universe escape and you do nothing. Wow.7, The worst fights in the 1st 9 DBZ movies. Z fighters get taken out instantly. No enjoyment value at all. Vegeta gets destroyed within the 1st minute of his fight. What is that? Either you are Gohan, or you can\'t do anything beneficial.8, Why didn\'t Vegeta kill the minions 1st: Vegeta is a smart warrior, he proved that on Namek, when he took out Zarbon and Dodoria and fought Ginyu Force before he went to face Frieza, but here Vegeta goes straight for the villain, just to be defeated, as a result from this movie trying to be thrilling, it does not work, Super Saiyan can take out Bojack\'s minion, so why didn\'t he do it and then go against Bojack with numbers advantage? Because of the plot.9, Bojack went for the Earth because it is the most beautiful planet: This might even better plot device than the plot device from Broly movie (Goku\'s crying). This is so dumb of a reason. He goes for Earth, because of its beauty? Just to destroy it, wtf?10, Goku saves the day, again: I am just gonna ignore the fact, he was able to even hit Bojack, because that would take way more time. Gohan cannot achieve Super Saiyan 2, even when he sees all his friends defeated. Nope, it has to be Goku (who\'s dead) to be the hero, as always. I love Goku, but these non-canon movies could have shown other Z warrior being the hero for once, but nope.11, The end, Satan is the newspaper hero, that\'s fine, but one last negative, why was this competition even a thing and why Bojack attacked through this competition. He only says, he likes Earth. He never reveals, why he appeared in the tournament. Well, it is again because of the plot. This way was the only way to separate Z warrior, so they get defeated in pathetic order to make any sense for this movie.Summary: This is the worst DBZ movie in the 1st nine movies. It even bests ""The world\'s strongest"". It ultimately makes everyone except Gohan, Goku and Trunks that one time useless. I hate it because it\'s lazy, dull and boring.As for that, I award Dragon Ball Movie Z 09: Bojack Unbound with 3/10 and I cannot recommend you this movie in any possible way. It\'s garbage. Watch it only if you are doing 100% DB run or 100% rerun.']"

Futari wa Precure: Max Heart Movie 2 - Yukizora no Tomodachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1931/Futari_wa_Precure__Max_Heart_Movie_2_-_Yukizora_no_Tomodachi,"[""I've talked about the PreCure franchise quite a bit. Including Futari wa, Max  Heart, & the first Max Heart film. Thus far, the weakest thing I've seen for the franchise was the mediocre Max Heart. The first film based off of that series managed to avoid a lot of its problems and turned out pretty well. Hopefully, the same will hold true for this week's fare. Futari wa PreCure: Max Heart Movie 2- Yukizora no Tomodachi.Story:We open with an old man carrying an egg and flying across the sky on the back of a flying squirrel, Muta. Muta warns the old man, Roshi,...not to drop the egg. Roshi says he won't but does and that's why his grand kids never call or visit. Two ice looking guys sense the situation and move to get to the egg. We cut to the one girl... You know, the boring one who was introduced in Max Heart that I can never remember the name of... I want to say Kanade. She's working with Akane when she finds the fluffy  little bird that hatched from the egg. From there we get to see our heroines, Honoka & Nagisa, as they're enjoying a ski trip. But what is this mysterious creature and why are Freezen & Frozen after it?Let's start with the issues with the film. The biggest one is just that it drags quite a bit. Take the ending. We get our climactic fight and then a good ten minutes of an attempted, but not well executed, secondary climax. We also have some completely pointless scenes of Honoka's grandmother. I liked her grandmother in the series but there's no reason for her to be in this film beyond an early phone call where she gives Honoka some advice. Nothing else she does has any impact on anything. The scenes that surround Ellen in general are just a drag. They revolve around her “bonding” with our mysterious friend but its very clumsily done since most of it is her holding the thing while looking dull or watching it also while looking dull. There's also a part of the film that revolves around Nagisa & Honoka having a fight but the impetus behind it is really weak. Basically, Nagisa overhears some random people who have mistaken Honoka & Fujipi for a couple and she gets upset because that's her Honoka, dammit. Here's the thing, though, Nagisa has known since before Max Heart even started that Honoka & Fujipi are old friends and she also knows that there's nothing more to their relationship than that. There's absolutely no reason for her to be upset here.There are also parts to the film I like. In  concept, I like the idea of contrasting a pair of true friends who will overcome their difficulties with a pair who will only stay close when things are going their way and I do like a lot of the scenes surrounding that, even if the event that kicks off that plot point is weak. A lot of the Honoka and Nagisa scenes in general are just good. I particularly like the moment where they talk about their hearts burning for one another.Characters:The characters are much the same as they are in the series proper. Nagisa and Honoka are still great characters. Ako is still entirely bland. It's nice to see Shiho and Rina get some nice support scenes. The villains are nothing ground breaking but they're fine. The same can be said for Muta, Roshi & our little bird. They're not interesting characters but they work for what the film needs them to do. Pollun is, unfortunately, back to being a major annoyance. He does throw a loud, obnoxious tantrum in this one. Honoka and Nagisa need to start packing heavy duty duct tape.Art:The artwork is nicely done. The action sequences flow well and the backgrounds are well detailed. I particularly like the way the film captures both a very picturesque winter wonderland aesthetic and a very oppressive frozen wasteland at different parts. The magical kingdom isn't nearly as pretty as the Garden of Hope was in the first Max Heart film but it's decent enough.Sound:I'll quickly go through the major characters, since I've talked about their performances at least twice previously. Honna Youko & Yukana are great. Tanaka Rie is a great actress but her performance in this is flat because Miyuki is a bore. Ikezawa Haruna's performance is annoying because that's the aesthetic they decided to go with for her character. Moving on to the film exclusive characters, Nozawa Masako returns. In the last film she was Round & Honoka's grandmother. In this one she's Muta & Honoka's grandmother. Her performance is good. You can't even tell by ear that Muta and the grandmother have the same voice. Aono Takeshi voices Roshi and he does a fine job. Our villains are voiced by Kusao Takeshi & Hiyama Nobuyuki. Both of whom deliver nice performances. Hinata is voiced by Chijimatsu Sachiko and she's decent enough. Like with the last film, Futari wa and the main series, we have a Sato Naoki soundtrack which includes Max Heart's theme tune. Which is basically Futari Wa's theme tune with minor changes. Still, he  is a good composer and it shows here.Ho-yay:Honoka and Nagisa definitely have some. And it culminates in the “burning hearts” scene. Because this is PreCure and shoujo ai subtext is what they do. Actually, is it even subtext at this point? They've held hands while cuddling up in bed and talking about how close they are and now we get the hearts burning for each other. It might qualify as just text at this point.Final Thoughts:This is actually what I expected from a Max Heart film when I reviewed the first one. It has some strong moments, some weak ones and just averages out to be kind of mediocre. If you enjoyed Max Heart or if you were a fan of Futari wa who doesn't mind putting up with Yayoi and Pollun for some cute Nagisa & Honoka moments you might enjoy watching it. For myself, I give it a 5/10. Next week I'll look at Chocolate Underground. not to drop the egg. Roshi says he won't but does and that's why his grand kids never call or visit.

This makes the one dimensionality of Freezen and Frozen\'s dynamic quite apparent. I enjoyed the aspect of one\'s heart being ""iced,"" so to speak, and the fight was quite interesting, if emotionally devastating for younger viewers. However, I was able to enjoy it, as well due to the fact that it was wonderfully choreographed and Porun saying goodbye to Hinata was stirring as well....The only issue I have with the movie is the subplot which began it all: the fact that Nagisa and Honoka already had a fight over her feelings over Fujimura in episode 10 of the prior season seems redundant, and makes the plot of their friendship being ""fake"" due to an argument over this questionable to say the least, given how much they\'ve bonded since then. However, this was thankfully forgotten quickly and was little more than a bump in an otherwise whimsical plot set in winter. I would like to give this movie a 6/10.

Happiness Charge Precure! Movie: Ningyou no Kuni no Ballerina,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23083/Happiness_Charge_Precure_Movie__Ningyou_no_Kuni_no_Ballerina,"['I\'ll admit, I\'m not the biggest fan of Happiness Charge Precure. Despite the fact that it has my all time favorite character in it (Hime), out of all the Precure series I\'ve seen, HapiCha is the worst for me. I don\'t hate it, but its story was extremely flawed from the start. It left many subplots and plot threads completely unresolved, chucked previous ones in favor of new things that come right out of nowhere, and it had pretty much no sense of focus, especially during its filler episodes. I liked the plot related episodes, especially the Iona/Hime grudge arc, but other than that, HapiCha...never seemed to know what it wanted to do or be. It didn\'t help that other than Hime, it had bland, static, or utterly annoying characters that came off more like mouthpieces than actual people. Is it a bad thing that I like the movie for HapiCha way more than the TV series? Honestly, in my opinion, this is what Happiness Charge Precure should have been like!The plot on the surface looks pretty simple. A girl named Tsumugi is coerced by an evil villain into taking the Pretty Cure into her imaginary world called the Doll Kingdom, and its residents are all sentient versions of all the dolls she has in her room. She\'s convinced the Pretty Cure want to destroy her perfect world and her happiness, but the girls know that the villain, Black Fang, is the one responsible for making her suffer. Seriously, I laud this movie for actually wanting to know what it wants to do and running with this premise to the end, because the show\'s lack of focus really turned me off. In fact, the story itself is simple in theory, but considering it\'s about a girl who wants nothing more than to stay in her own world, far away from reality and the people around her and the fact that it doesn\'t make her or others happy, it could symbolize a lot of things. For all I know the whole thing could be a gigantic metaphor/allegory on autism and what it\'s like, or it\'s deconstructing the concept of closing oneself away to the point of wanting to stay inside yourself forever. It gives off a really good message that people can relate to: closing yourself off from reality and running away won\'t make you or others happy, even if you think it will. Let people in. Let people help you. And don\'t listen to people who claim they\'ll give you happiness or make your dreams come true, because its a scam or a trick.The animation is just sumptuous. I know HapiCha had a lot of animation problems in the series, and I didn\'t like how blurry the artstyle looked, but the animators really pulled out the stops on this one. Everything is flashy, colorful, fluid, and knows how to stimulate the senses in the best way possible. The music...yay! HapiCha has its own soundtrack and isn\'t ripping off DokiDoki for once! I liked the songs (except the OP and ED. Ugh! Too squeaky!) and the BGMs, but they\'re not particularly memorable. But that doesn\'t mean I hate it.Let\'s talk about the movie characters first...and seriously, I LOVE the movie characters! Tsumugi, Dark Fang, Zeke, good God they\'re awesome! Especially the main villain, Black Fang! He is pretty much everything that Red isn\'t: an intimidating, kick-butt, monstrous, heartless demon who will do anything to achieve his goals, doesn\'t mess around, completely ruins a young girl\'s life and happiness for his own ends, uses her the whole time, wants to trap her in a fake utopia, and pretty much tries to destroy the world. This is how you make a good villain, writers! A good villain is intimidating, gets what he wants, will do anything to get it even if it means hurting innocent people, actually does something, and doesn\'t give a flying rat\'s hat about anything else! Seriously, I\'ll take him over whiny, pathetic, annoying Red any day of the week! Better yet, WHY CAN\'T HE BE THE MAIN SERIES VILLAIN?! Sure, his motivation is kinda weak, but I can totally forgive it since Red\'s motivation was pathetic, incompetent, poorly executed, and terrible from the very start.Unfortunately...the main girls suffer in the character department. Yuuko and Iona are just there to be suspicious, Hime falls head over heels over Zeke, and Megumi is her usual annoyingly sweet ""shiawase happiness""-spouting main character who tries to help Tsumugi by being nosy and acting like she\'s an angel that can save Tsumugi from her suffering. Yeah, they\'re easily the worst part of the movie. Also, Deus Ex Machina power-up that never appears in the show, miracle lights save the day (though points for putting them in the movie in a way that actually makes sense!), everyone\'s all peppy happy blah blah blah. I don\'t think I need to go on here.Not a great movie, but not a bad one either. But if you\'re looking for good characters, give it a miss, because it doesn\'t handle the main characters well one bit. never seemed to know what it wanted to do or be.

This makes her despair as wanted for the villain of this movie, Black Fang. Once the girls go to the Kingdom of Dolls after being invited by her, it's the start of a mix of wanting to have fun there and doubts about the current situation the place is in.This movie handles pretty nicely the...drama of the story, and especially gives quite a lot of love to Megumi and Hime, with emotional protagonism to the first and lots of funny moments for the second, Iona and Yuuko sadly got the short end of the stick on that regard, and I don't even want to talk about poor Seiji and Blue. Together with Tsumugi there is also Prince Zeke, a character that cares a lot about her and that I liked quite a lot, which is nice especially considering the relatively short duration of this movie.The animation and art quality of this movie was very good, with nice action scenes and well executed reactions from the characters to the events, definitely nothing to complain on that regard.I'm satisfied with what I watched and I can recommend if you enjoyed the series or you just want to see more of Megumi and Hime. drama of the story, and especially gives quite a lot of love to Megumi and Hime, with emotional protagonism to the first and lots of funny moments for the second, Iona and Yuuko sadly got the short end of the stick on that regard, and I don't even want to talk about poor Seiji and Blue.

Jigoku Sensei Nube OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2745/Jigoku_Sensei_Nube_OVA,"['Its recommended to watch the anime first as the OVA takes place after key events of the series. Episodes 1 & 2 feel like extended Nube episodes, however Episode 3 has the feel of a movie.As expected of OVA series, the animation is of higher quality which is more noticeable in the prologue & some scenes. The same goes for the OST being new & performed by Masamichi Amano whose done soundtracks for several OVAs, however the biggest highlight is the last episode which will be explained in more detail down below.Episode 1: Students have been disappearing around campus which is the act of a...ghost that hides in the walls. Nube is nearly captured by the ghost as he extracts his soul in the form of a boy Together with his students, Nube must regain his body, save the children, & exorcise this phantom. Overall alright episode as it displays the affection the students have for their teacher Nube.Episode 2: A young ghost girl enters the dreams of Nube\'s students in which they must listen to complicated instructions on a path to find her harmonica, however if one takes the wrong path, they\'ll forever rest in peace. The story behind this OVA is a very creepy one but manages to deliver a heartwarming ending as Nube discovers the grief behind this girl.Episode 3: THIS IS THE BEST ONE!! A demon named Zekki has come from the 6th level of Hell in order to rescue his brother Baki from Nube\'s seal. Meanwhile Nube\'s seal is getting weaker as Hell itself will soon feast itself on Earth. The animation for this episode is very unique as it almost resembles a different studio even though it\'s still animated by Toei. The character designs have more of a ""pop"" to them as their hairstyles, color & detail seem more ""movie exclusive"". Interesting thing about this OVA is that it really resembles a Go Nagai series as the author & artist of Hell Teacher Nube were inspired by Devilman among other series. With its near perfect blend of comedy & horror, certainly gives this episode a Go Nagai vibe along with delivering as something you won\'t see in the anime. There isn\'t that much violence but certainly feels more like a dark battle shonen with the great animation of demon battles.Overall, this OVA series is great with the final episode being the perfect way to end it. ghost that hides in the walls.

There isn\'t that much violence but certainly feels more like a dark battle shonen with the great animation of demon battles.Overall, this OVA series is great with the final episode being the perfect way to end it.']"

This series needs way more attention then it's getting.Story and characters: 8You know whats actually super refreshing when it comes to these kinds of shows. Where it be reincarnation, isekai, any of the sort. Actually having a character that THINKS, and acts SMARTLY for once. Instead of making either silly and stupid choices.That is what we get through this show when it comes to Pride. A main character that actually not only considers options, but thinks through them, and acts upon such, resulting in a better outcome then what the game she's been reincarnated into would've gone.It's so refreshing...to see such take place, and makes us actually take notice of other things within the story and it's context. Seeing the foreshadowing in certain parts, and making us interested in the direction that it takes us next. Credit to the people behind this.The main reason this isn't getting any higher, is mainly because from the first three episodes, we mainly know of Pride to get behind. Not that the other characters aren't there, and there isn't pathways to go down in terms of plot to go behind. More that through a lot of the first three episodes, it will esbalishes the direction of the show, but also really showcases Pride as the headliner, and those round her at the moment, are her back up dancers, and while they've had time to shine, and will more so as the series goes on. But given what we got, it's Pride's show right now, it's her play, and she's moving the pieces in the direction that'll save her life, it's good stuff.Art and sound: 8The art has a very good tone to it. I really adore the colours, and how everything looks. So well detailed, and being fit for purpose. Being followed by some excellent sound work, and music to set the tone of the series. Not only being easy on the eyes, and easy on the ears, but makes it appealing to watch as a result. Making sure to capture the atmosphere, and really showcasing that to perfection, that'll deliver on all fronts of what it's presenting, and how the characters feel within each and every scene.

If you’ve ever watched fantasy shows and cringed at how stupid the main character acts or the usual anime shenanigans like not being able to communicate properly which would solve 90 percent of issues, good news for you. This series actually addresses those things. In fact, that’s the bulk of the show. The characters communicate and talk through their issues like normal people. It was such a breath of fresh air and I will...miss it greatly. If you’re a fan of good worldbuilding, fantasy, shoujo, otome or just cute anime girls, this is a great watch that you won’t regret.I’ve always felt that the best fantasy shows are the ones that you forget are fantastical. Instead of focusing on magic and action, they focus on interpersonal relationships and character growth. Lastame is exactly that. There’s several episodes that largely consist of just the main cast talking and working their way through ideological issues, but they’re set up in such a way that you become captivated and lose track of time. Pride as a MC just finds a way to compromise and achieve results no matter what. The thing is, it never feels like an asspull. The show walks you through the perspectives of everyone involved and by the time a solution is found it feels natural. This is the biggest selling point of the show for me. Yea, Pride is cute, but she’s not just a pretty face. She’s aware of the things that she’s done in the past and truly wants to make amends, while promoting equality for her kingdom. She doesn’t just want to change her future, she wants to change the systems and traditions that made that future possible in the first place.You’ve probably gathered already, but Lastame is a slow-burn character driven story that focuses on Pride and her relationships with the side characters. All of the side characters are dealing with some trauma that Pride helps them through. They all feel developed, meaningful and their emotional story beats land very well. There’s a couple scenes throughout the show that truly got me emotional. It’s always good to see smaller casts in these fantasy shows as they really make it easier to flesh them out and become attached. There’s no harem or fanservice antics either in here. There’s a little bit of romance hinted at, but it’s very much on the backburner other than a blush every now and again, so if you’re someone who likes good writing that doesn’t rely on anime booba or wish fulfillment, you’ve got one here.Lastame takes its time getting into the meat of the story. It’s not until the last 3 episodes that we even get hints as to the big bad(s) of the story. Up until then it’s mainly worldbuilding and conflict resolution. That’s not a knock on it though. In an era where every fantasy show has 3 episodes before a 5 year time skip where the MC is already OP, I will always appreciate shows like this that take their time. There’s two minor time skips, but for the bulk of the show Pride is still a little kid/pre-teen. Albeit a very smart one. I think if you enjoyed Honzuki, Niehime or other slower paced stories you’ll see similarities both in the maturity of all 3 MCs as well as the vibe of the story.Really the only flaw I could point out with Lastame is that the animation is a little meh. The studio aren’t exactly known for groundbreaking stuff, so it is what it is. The story also doesn’t have too much action, but when it happens, it’s noticeably low grade. A few of the fights use that generic white line going towards the character to indicate motion gimmick. If you’ve watched enough anime you know what I mean. But, since it is overwhelmingly dialogue based it did not affect my enjoyment too much.In closing, I think we’re in a weird limbo of sorts with anime. People claim they’re tired of the same old same old, but then they get shows that actually focus on characters and establishing a world, and they don’t check them out. This show is quite simply put criminally underrated and deserves more love and attention. One episode is all it took for me to know it would be in my top 4 of the season and to go out and buy all the books. I thoroughly enjoyed this series and am very much looking for a possible second season. Here’s to hoping it’s soon.Lastame gets 9 out of 10. miss it greatly.

At around age 6, MC gets her memories from past life and realizes that she is a villain princess who will bring this country to ruin (does lots of evil stuff in the process). And she wants to somehow try to save her kingdom from herself.It does resemble bakarina in regards to villainess + harem + not realizing that everyone loves her + saving the love interests etc.. But this show is much darker with basically no comedy/romance.Right now, we are still in the harem gathering phase. It basically loops through a plot that roughly goes --> ""introduce sad...boi, MC does something nice for him and saves him, sad boi become happy and join her fan club"".  MC saves 4 bois by the end of the season.1. In the supposed game, the villainess was really fucked up and felt like a truly evil person. not like the usual stuck up ego princess bullshit, but someone who truly enjoys the misery of others.2. MC is (sort of) realistic and actually understands her situation. She also has no problem with killing people or making people into slaves as long as it is in the best interests of her subjects/country. She is also a little suicidal (self-sacrificing?) when trying to save others.3. She uses her brain, which is a rare trait among anime leads. And She has something called the ""last boss buff"" which allows her to be OP. This makes her really strong and we can always appreciate a strong badass female lead.4. The harem members. instead of infighting, they actually work together hard to be of better service to our future Queen (MC). Lots of bromance moments.On the negative side though,1. the original villain character was so unhinged, that i am starting to wonder if she had brain damage. why so dark :(. I am here for otome harem gimmicks, not to be repulsed by tragedy/torture.2. The show milks that ""tragic"" heroine sentiment really hard. our MC is continuously worried (whining) about how she may become a cruel person eventually. It gets annoying after a point and doesn\'t need to be forced into every episode. It definitely needs a Drama tag.3. zero creativity. The story is very predictable (especially the plain dialogues). Every scene feels like you have already watched it a hundred times in the past.Overall, this is a mediocre show just like most isekai/otome productions. But within the otome genre, this may be a decent watch. boi, MC does something nice for him and saves him, sad boi become happy and join her fan club"".  MC saves 4 bois by the end of the season.1.

And half of the episode is just 2 dude\'s talking about Pride.The Pacing is Horrible, for 12 eps per season anime.Character? Cringe, they keep praising the MC Like there\'s No tomorrow, they have no other personality other than to praising and fall in love to Pride (The MC name), seems the author or script writer self insert them self In this story...And The characters name Giving the vibe of ""Yes, I do read dictionary!""I mean seriously...Pride?, STALE, Tiara. And the Royalty or...should I say Family name was ""IVY"" Sure... Might as well calling my son AK-47 in the future...The story can be more interesting If the Story is more Darker, like it\'s supposed to.Kinda like Stale is actually treated like a slave, or Roderick (Arthur Dad) Die in that Cliff.Episode 2-5 they barely changing scene, or doing anything, it\'s basically just watching Ted Talk, but with some ""Dark Flashback"" occasionally.Only episode 4 that has some action.It basically trying to copy The my next life as the Villainess, but more ""Dark""Yeah right... The only thing that\'s different from the mentioned anime, was GUN.Oh and a Horrible story.No comedy, the story barely moving forward, don\'t waste your time... should I say Family name was ""IVY"" Sure...

There is this section called ""MAL Score vs Anime Score"", and to me, this show in a nutshell belongs to the criteria of ""They loved it, I didn\'t"". Now you know, thanks.We\'ve had like the Isekai villainess/Otome game sub-genre for like what, 3 years now? HameFura was a lot of fun (and still is to this day); AkuLas was kinda OK in spots; TsunLise was really fun mashing both real life and virtual reality at the same time; and the most recent of all, Kanojo ga...Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu a.k.a Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke\'s Mansion easily takes the cake for being one of the best Shoujo Isekai reincarnation stories of recent times. Yeap, you might ask why I put Raeliana on there, knowing full well that it\'s not related to the villainess sub-genre at all. This brings me to novelist Tenichi\'s Higeki no Genkyou to Naru Saikyou Gedou Last Boss Joou wa Tami no Tame ni Tsukushimasu. a.k.a The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen: From Villainess to Savior (abbreviated by its short name LastAme), yet another work that lends itself to the sub-genre and its defining tropey features. But however, like a tick-tock cycle of ""good, then mediocre/decent"" show count, LastAme was kinda lackluster to be very frank.Let\'s tick all the boxes that LastAme has to offer:- A villainess that gets reincarnated as the villainess who has to avoid bringing her own doom through her own in-game scripted harbingers and change history forever? Check, same with HameFura and (technically) Raeliana.- A harem that seeks to please both the MC and her surrounding people of influence, be it family members, friends or even royalty? Check, all of the above has at least a single armchair of influential people that is willing to see her through, turning past misadventures into opportunity to change for the better.- Has countless enemies that seek to execute the misdirection and bring the MC to doom, as well as both intended and unintended people to love her one and the same? Check, same as above.Literally the only thing that LastAme stands out in the villainess regard is in its title: From Villainess to Savior. This is the story of the once dominant Heretical Boss Queen Pride Royal Ivy who is nothing but a terrible queen to all of her subjects, where the rightful queen and dear sister Tiara would end her life to stop all of the misogyny that surrounds the four walls of the kingdom. And seemingly, her reincarnation has a second chance to basically renege all of the wrongdoings of the original timeline, which alters history and the original queen\'s devilish evil side to earn the usual reputation of the good and nurtured queen in her growing-up years. The sole objective of Pride Royal Ivy: from hate to love, that\'s her name of the game.The thing is, all of her subjects who come into contact with her, supposedly when reset back to the very first time that Pride wasn\'t building her infamous and nasty reputation, they did not know all of these and assume that things should go the same way as how it\'s done. But that\'s what the reincarnation phase is for, to give a second chance at redeeming what is otherwise the usual fiery and nonchalant personality of Pride herself. As mentioned, Pride has only one goal, which is to fix her mishaps and lead her people into victory and reconciliation, that her position of being the First Queen is a testament to that regard, from her own younger sister of Tiara and the adopted brother of Stale, to people like Arthur Beresford (the son of the Knight Captain Roderick), showing their unwavering loyalty towards her to build constitution and stability in the kingdom, amidst the usual enemies whom for better or for worse, had their lives changed by Pride in one way or another through heretical, but justified means. And that same mentality also earns her a harem of sorts, though that part is weighed down against achieving her goal, which is a good differentiator from the rest of the pack.The problem is, this formula seems to be so repetitive in fact, that it feels predictable as heck. For example, the original Pride Royal Ivy treated Stale like hell, forcing him to obey her through a magical contract that ends up with him being ordered to kill his biological mother. And when the new reincarnated Pride comes along, she senses these pre-meditated events through dreams of visions that haunt her memories and makes a decision to save those whom she will oppress later on. And when all is said and done, earns the loyalty of the oppressed and becomes a fighting force alongside her in the process. While this is good and all, down the line, with Tiara, Arthur, and even some of the key supporting character cast, the formula is one and the same with no varieties of the sort, and this is where LastAme really falls short of the typical villainess story beats, though I\'ll admire Pride being a centrifugal force of the story\'s plot, being actually involved when the need calls for it. As it goes on and on, Pride gains the respect of more and more people (which is a good thing in fact), but at the cost of repetitiveness, it just seems that the author had hit a brick wall with his/her creativity, drawing the plagarism line on trying not to be too similar to premises like HameFura, which had preceded the original source material by some years.OLM is a rather large and renowned studio for many works and all, but like Sunrise, having to be split into production teams for the sizable workforce. And in recent years, the Team Yoshioka division has been rather forthcoming with some of their most notable works like Spring 2021\'s Odd Taxi and Winter 2022\'s Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to a.k.a Life with an Ordinary Guy who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout (a.k.a FabiNiku). The closest resemblance to production values like the latter, it\'s decent and doesn\'t offer any in the way of much action, but it just honestly speaks being servicable at the very least.For the OST, I\'m still not convinced that rock band Tsukuyomi has ever graced a song that feels like it\'s overcomplicated for its own good. And being the likelihood that their first outing being Birdie Wing\'s 1st ED song and then Iseleve\'s OP song, if you need a song that speaks the edgy side of things, then Tsukuyomi is a rather good fit, just as is with this show\'s OP here. Though I will say that I found a surprise with ChoQMay\'s ED, serving as their debut Anisong with both a comfy and upbeat song, which I really like.I really wanted to like LastAme, I really do, deep down from my heart of always giving underrated shows a second chance at redemption. But it turns out that all that the show has going for it is a mocked strategy of plot repetition and intensity (which is par for the course for villainess works), and other than the usual ""I love the MC, then MC blushes"" trope, there is nothing significant about LastAme. Not even its dark undertones, which ironically, Raeliana did it better in almost every other way, and there\'s just no safe haven of distinction that I can say about this show and the original source material.Try if you feel like wasting some good time on a show like this, but as engaging as it tries to be with all its (really) good foreshadowing, it really doesn\'t stand out a lot and feels mundane.

Such a waste.', 'It\'s incredibly good, has an actual intelligent, powerful and OP female lead, as a girl myself I find this so refreshing. She\'s actual badass and the story isn\'t at all focused on some romance that takes the spotlight from the female lead. It\'s very well made thus far and has become one of my absolute favourites!! ❤️It\'s been a while since I last watched an anime that made me this excited, don\'t create expectations based off of my review, just watch it and create your own opinion, bottom line is that I recommend it to everyoneThe trope is similar any other villainess anime/manhwa,...where the protagonist is reincarnated/isekaid into another world, however this story is more similar to the manhwa\'s I enjoy reading the most, with the bad side of the original villainess being more raw and better portrayed than any other anime released yet. The current Villainess is the complete opposite of the original villainess and that contrast is very well portrayed too.Ex. ""My next life as a villainess/I\'m the Villainess so I\'m taming the final boss"" are very sugar coated; don\'t portray the crimes the original villainess did; become too focused on romance and take away the spotlight from the female lead; don\'t have much of a plot (or an interesting one, at that).OP female lead ✅Balance between suspense, cuteness and charismatic female lead ✅Caring family ✅No sexualisation of women ✅No focus on random forced romance ✅Character development and interesting characters ✅ where the protagonist is reincarnated/isekaid into another world, however this story is more similar to the manhwa\'s I enjoy reading the most, with the bad side of the original villainess being more raw and better portrayed than any other anime released yet.

Rather than judging its elements separately I will rate it by how it made me feel which has been AWESOME. Its tear jerking and emotionally satisfying even without complexity or novelty. With that said, its not entirely predictable ether and I like the moral its trying to convey, which is that even villains are often just victims of their circumstances. If you're looking for something easy going that will make you feel fuzzy on the inside then...this will be a great choice. this will be a great choice."", ""I think this might one one of the few villianess shows that breaks the mold enough to recommend to people outside of the subgenre.Regarding out protagonist, Pride. She is being terrified of turning into everything she hates. Early on its clear she has nightmares about what her 'character' will do, but unlike most other shows of this kind she really believes she's fated to bring tragedy to the kingdom and people she loves. Large chunks of the show are her setting up ways and means to protect people against her. It's an interesting twist and creates a number of flaws in her character. Personally...I got the idea she was almost driven to madness by this, but this is up to interpretation (and really not a spoiler).The supporting cast are excellent, with both siblings being adorable and properly fleshed out plus a number of important supporting characters I grew to love. There's not a lot I can say without spoiling arcs. The only criticism is that Tiara doesn't get much to do, but I assume that's because she's more important to the story further in the LN.If romance is important to you though look elsewhere, Pride is a driven heroine and bagging a dude isn't her top priority. I appreciated this and it only made me love the show more.The pacing is a touch rushed in the back half of the show but I can't complain too much. I loved watching Pride's journey, and the development of those around her as she obsessively protects everyone she can. It's a character-driven narrative, and it does that well.

To the extent that I feel obligated to write my first ever review to help it along. I\'ll break it down upon four bases: Story (Plot + Characters), Aesthetic (Artstyle + Soundtrack).Plot: 10/10Doubtless one of the best stories for a villainess reincarnation story. I\'m not going to make unrealistic comparisons with anime that have god-tier stories like Death Note and so on because the genre is different. Higeki, despite using a generic isekai trope where the female protagonist reincarnates into a villainess with prior knowledge of the story doesn\'t fail to...entertain. More importantly, it doesn\'t fail to move. Pride is undoubtedly powerful, but the strength and OP-ness of the MC doesn\'t deduct any points from plot development and character development. Which brings me to my next point.Character: 10/10Character development is Higeki\'s biggest strength. I would argue it has the best storytelling thanks to its tasteful insertion of character origin stories, exposing what drives them on. Higeki tops it all off with numerous endearing, heartwarming, and emotional scenes with moral didactics that have made me shed a tear more than once. Close to unrivalled amongst isekai.Artstyle: 8.5/10The artstyle is not as flashy or as amazing as other anime this year. I\'m not surprised, considering the fact that it\'s produced by a relatively lesser-known studio. Despite this, it\'s most definitely not shabby at all. In fact, the action scenes (which there are a noteworthy amount) are quite engaging. Outside of action scenes, the animation stays plain drawing our attention more to the dialogue and characters, but once the action starts, you suddenly get much better animation, and some nostalgic old-school effects that I think really enhance the style of this anime. Very impressive, actually.Soundtrack: 8.5/10Let\'s start with the opening. I was pleased to hear that it was sung by Tsukuyomi, who is equally underrated and starting to pick up steam. Her unique voice really makes the opening palatable to sit through, unlike other shows. Furthermore, the opening itself has very good scenes and isn\'t some generic boring ""character showcase"". More points there. The ending wasn\'t as striking, but this is a typical stylistic choice to relieve the tension from the audience. The ending\'s singer is quite pleasant to listen to actually. Finally, about the soundtrack throughout the show: Nothing short of masterful. Apt and fitting for each scene, to the point where you don\'t know it\'s there and working its magic on you. That\'s how soundtracks should be.Overall: 36/40A very high score for the reasons listed above. I\'ve been a watcher of anime since 2013, and I\'ve seen so many including older shows that I don\'t bother logging them anymore. This is one of the only shows I have put in my favourites. It\'s not like a candy that I will regularly use to cheer myself up, but a hearty stew that truly warms me in the inside.I highly recommend giving this a try to anyone. Even if you don\'t find it to your taste, at the very least you can see that it is a cut above the others. entertain. More importantly, it doesn\'t fail to move.

Pride, the main character is a strong yet loveable lady who tries to repent for the terrible things her character had done to others.The story isn't very elaborate but what makes this show good is Pride's plans and will to change. All the old male film producers always assume girls only like delicate, shy and helpless female characters in stories. And if those female characters can protect themselves then they are made to be sexualized otherwise. Which is why I really enjoy watching Pride casually pull out...a sword and a gun and fight. Her character alone is carrying this show basically.They say isekais are all the same but anime like this one prove that they aren't afraid of changing the status quo. ( which obviously doesn't apply to isekais targeted at men )The art is very enjoyable, it has some really good moments. Set and costume design is very generic but it's not a bad thing. a sword and a gun and fight.

Set and costume design is very generic but it's not a bad thing."", ""The character development here is very obvious and simple but it works, what makes it interesting to me is the comparison between the character's original motivation from Pride's first incarnation to the current one, the only character that feels boring is Tiara who suffers from the Nezuko Syndrome (cute and kind little sister with no personality besides being a good sister)- although I will recognize she doesn't feel out of place, she properly acts like a noble and she's not just a stereotype to make Pride (even more) insecure, but so far she's not very well written.On the topic of character writing It's also...refreshing to see that the love interests don't hate each other or ignore the other's existence, seeing Stale's and Arthur's relationship grow is very nice.Now, not to be that person but this is just your classic overpowered isekai protagonist and the mc knows it. And it's not bad at all, I wouldn't say it's exceptional or anything close but, it's worth a watch if you enjoy these tropes. However this is not an action-packed anime, and I don't think it's trying to be one, It has fight scenes but the focus is clearly on the characters and how they relate to Pride; It is a bit tiring how Pride is treated as a perfect goddess meanwhile she sees herself as a monster, the and the dynamic gets annoying after episode 3, while I have some hopeful thoughts on the matter for now its just that inconvenient little theme.On to Pride herself, I usually don't like isekai protagonists because they tend to be quite stupid and naive, Meanwhile Pride can be blind to people's emotions towards her during the series- she's not conveniently dumb for the plot and she thinks before acting, so that's another good point in my eyes.The art style is pretty but it's clear as day that the animators didn't have the budget to make things consistently good, some scenes are animated in funny ways (especially some of the walking scenes) but I believe that they managed to make the show flow decently regardless, it didn't bother me too much and I laughed a little.Overall it's fine, I will continue watching it and I don't think it's a waste of time. It's definitely not for everyone though. refreshing to see that the love interests don't hate each other or ignore the other's existence, seeing Stale's and Arthur's relationship grow is very nice.Now, not to be that person but this is just your classic overpowered isekai protagonist and the mc knows it.

I\'ll try to break down what a piece of garbage this is, as best I can, without spoilers.First, and most importantly, the ENTIRE premise of the show makes absolutely no sense. I\'m not talking about the whole reincarnation issekai thing, I mean the motivations of the MC. The TL;DR of the plot is the MC is living a game she previously played and is now the antagonist in that game. The original antagonist and protagonist in the game had some sort of premonition power but now the MC just has her knowledge from having played the game....Within the first 5 minutes of the first episode that the MC drastically alters the game world by her actions, and understands the implications of this. Take that in. Literally 5min in we are given this information, yet the MC seems to believe in some sort of predestined outcome with ABSOLUTELY NO evidence and as the series continues the overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary. This means the entire motivations of the MC make absolutely no sense.To make things worse, the MC\'s knowledge of the game is supposed to represent her ""premonition"" skill yet it isn\'t long before the world is totally different from the game world she had played. Why is this even still useful? Why does the MC not recognize that things are totally different? Which brings me to the next point which makes this so egregious...The MC is super competent and brilliant. Totally forward thinking, strategic, empathetic, and mature sometimes but completely irrational, dense, unaware, and outright stupid the rest of the time. There is no logical consistency within the character as whole.Now let\'s get into the ""powers."" I won\'t spoil anything but the powers are suddenly insanely powerful or totally useless basically as it suits the story. They have the most outlandish powers and use them for the dumbest reasons, then occasionally will be like ""oh I could do this!"" only to somehow immediately forget that fact soon after.Lastly, what makes this such a horrible anime is that its actually kind of cute, charming, and fun. The characters are likeable in their own way, and the stakes feel real, and you can lean into the cheeze. Also, the anime seems to constantly place subtle hints about something more going on, a bigger picture, teasing a twist. There are so many opportunities to have made this interesting, and its like the writers didn\'t even see the nuggets they themselves had written. The story is just a bland execution of a flawed premise from ep 1 to 12 with everything playing out so blandly that the ""what could have been"" is the most cardinal sin of the entire show.Trust me, you are better off not wasting your time watching this. It will pull you in and NEVER deliver. Within the first 5 minutes of the first episode that the MC drastically alters the game world by her actions, and understands the implications of this.

Not as the main Heroine, but she is an evil last-boss Villainess (very strong). Which... is not new, this genre has become very popular recently in various settings and storytelling, after HameFura\'s success (I think). Even though I am a man, I enjoy this category quite a bit as well.The story,is interesting and fun in the first few episodes. Since FMC is a vivid fan of the ""Our Ray of Light"" game series, she knows everything and knows the future. She tries to fix her doomed future...which she will ruin her country and get killed by the main Hero.The problem is,the story is kinda flat after that. She executed her plan flawlessly and avoided all mistakes, which is too perfect in my opinion. From the most hated evil villainess, she turns 180 degrees and becomes the most loved princess. The story doesn\'t have many surprises or plot twists.For an otome game genre,it doesn\'t have much love rival, conflict, or love triangle because the supposedly real Heroine is her sister and FMC treats her with love very well, thus there is no sister drama either. Everyone is all good friends here in this story timeline.Maybe it\'s still too early? or need SS2 continuation? because I still don\'t see real enemies, country conflicts, war, or anything yet. FMC is still 15 y/o but the actual game should start when she is 18 y/o.Quality is ok,The art is nicely drawn, the girls are cute and wear noble fuwa-fuwa fluffy dresses all the time. The boys are shoujo-style (too handsome). The animation is average but it\'s not bad (many Isekai are worse than this).Overall,I give Lastame 7/10 ""Mixed Feelings"" because it\'s not bad (but that\'s all about it). You can enjoy this if you like feel-good no-drama otome Isekai anime. Otherwise, you can skip this show. which she will ruin her country and get killed by the main Hero.The problem is,the story is kinda flat after that.

And this one is no exception.As with most isekai, someone passes on and thus becomes princess pride from their favorite video game. What I really liked about this one as opposed to other stories with similar plots, is that the main protagonist, princess pride, doesn’t win over her people by being just kind and pretty. Her intellect was much more valued in this show, and was the reason people began to devote themselves to protecting her or supporting her on her endeavors to become queen.This one really...reminded me of the one I just watched, 7th Time Loop, where the MC also uses her intelligence to succeed - not only in her personal life, but in her relationships. Her intellect was something that was admired, more than anything else about her. but what I really liked about both of these shows, is that even though they had the girl boss mentality, they still allowed for romance. 7th Time Loop has a lot more romance than this one, but I don’t mind that this one’s lacking in that because there’s a lot more love interests to be had.I really hope they do a second season and she spends more time with each of the love interests and thus having more romance between them. But, even without that the show was still very fun to watch. I highly highly recommend! reminded me of the one I just watched, 7th Time Loop, where the MC also uses her intelligence to succeed - not only in her personal life, but in her relationships.

From trying to change the your own fate by doing everything you can to be the best person you can be is honestly refreshing.

And that\'s fine, that\'s a good idea, and the first episodes kind of hook you, but the it all stops.As usual with this kind of anime, after a while the ""interesting idea"" of being reincarnated in to an evil character simply becomes meaningless, she was evil before being reincarnated, but now she\'s a nice person, so who cares if the character of the game was originally evil? It\'s not like it has any impact of the story anyway.And in fact, it doesn\'t. The story becomes the usual sort of boring thing that doesn\'t really have a direction where nothing too exciting ever happens, it\'s alright, but nothing special, if anything a tad boring at times.The characters aren\'t anything too special or deep, we see them growing but they aren\'t too complex, they are stay, grow up nice and stay nice, Gilbert is probably the only one with a sort of more interesting background, the teleport kid also has an interesting background, but those interesting backgrounds are simply explained in a single episode, aside from that they make a very little difference.I believe that it would have been a better if the character reincarnated in the princess already being adult, that way the princess being originally evil would have already created some events that would end up affecting the main character, this is ""too easy"".Or they could have made the sister become evil instead, to make contrast with the game and mix up the story, bring something new and unexpected.In the end, this anime is nothing special, it had a good idea that got discarded pretty early on, it has ok characters that aren\'t anything too memorable.The animation is mid, nothing too special, fights aren\'t god tier level, there are a couple nice scenes like the one with the prisoner crying which was pretty touching, but that\'s about it.I you don\'t have anything else to watch that you are excited about, watch this, but don\'t expect it to be great. tries to put it\'s own little twist to it, and in this case the ""twist"" is pretty interesting, the protagonist is reincarnated into a world from a video game that she loves, she reincarnated into the evil princess, but since she\'s a good person, she does her best to not become the dictator of a tyranny, but rather to be a kind and loving princess in the future rules of a peaceful place.

I see the direction they\'re trying to head towards, and it is not a terrible presentation (yes it is), but the way it\'s shown to me is just plain bad. However,...I appreciate the logistics they try to put out (it\'s still poorly executed) and I enjoyed the few moments she obliterated and killed everyone as an 11-year-old girl like it was nothing!If you\'re in for some weird dramatical shit where the lead collects play-toys of boys along her crying adventure, then you\'d probably love this series to death. Otherwise, either never see this thing or just use it as a way to feed your Isekai Genre addiction. Perhaps it\'s just me who doesn\'t have the patience to see the ""depth"" the show offers, but who is able to stand a Female Lead complaining about her self-doom and bitter ending? Not me.All in all:- Predictable and typical plot- Dramatic- Badass MC who gives no shit about her enemies- Side characters adapt to how she\'s feeling (she cry they cry she mad they maddd)Won\'t rec to anyone, there are plenty of better options.

The character she body hops into is the 6-year-old princess of the story who will become the game\'s villain, the ""Last Boss"". Upon realizing her role in this world, the MC decides to defy fate and prevent her scripted death. Equipped with her knowledge of the game\'s timeline and events, she can make changes at key moments in the ""story"" and alter the future...in her favor.The above is the standard start for the Villainess genre, nothing new here, however, in this case the whole setup is basically pointless. In any good series about changing the future, the point is to use knowledge not because you can, but because you will be unable to achieve their goals without it. In the case of this series, the original villain is so ridiculously evil that no sane person would be able to act the same even if they tried. By simply swapping the original villain to the MC, her fate has already been saved even if she doesn\'t realize it. In spite of this, the MC continues to worry about her future, thinking that someday her mind may suddenly change and she will become the thing she is trying to avoid. She cries for the people ""she"" has wronged, showing extreme remorse for actions that have not (and will not) come to pass swearing to do everything she can to make things right. Again, this is pointless given she is not a psychopath, but the problems do not end there.Beyond this are the plot holes, too many to overlook. Listing them off: the MC character\'s personality does a complete 180 once the body swap happens but no one thinks anything of it; in the case of her father, the MC makes crucial changes to the story without thinking or even realizing things may change until afterword; the MC\'s mother can see the future and knows that MC was supposed to become the villain, but does nothing to stop it; the MC has a ""cheat"" ability for some reason that makes her a master swordsman with zero practice; the plot justifies a heroic battle for the MC by teleporting someone in, rather than the simpler option of teleporting someone out. Three episodes was all it took to turn the plot into Swiss cheese.Personally, the biggest disappointment was that I could see potential. There was a key moment in episode 2 where I thought they could drastically change the story and make things more interesting. When the MC became a sword pro, I thought ""All they need to do is throw in a line about her body being unuse to the activity or getting sore later,"" but they didn\'t. In the teleport incident I thought maybe there was a limitation to the power, only to watch as that idea was spit on just for the plot to progress in a certain way. This is the show\'s biggest sin.If you read this and decide to watch anyway, my advice is to turn your brain off. The show looks and sounds fine so at least you\'ll have that to distract you. Just keep in mind that you won\'t find anything thought provoking or worth remembering. in her favor.The above is the standard start for the Villainess genre, nothing new here, however, in this case the whole setup is basically pointless.

This time with a twist of a darker theme to it.The anime follows Pride, the first born princess of the kingdom, who suddenly gets the memory of a Japanese girl. She realizes she is reborn as the future villainess of a game, and decides to change her destiny. You then follow her going through scenes related to the original story and see her try to change it for a brighter future.One of the things that differs from similar animes is that the main character has strong abilities and the anime keeps a...darker tone. Where you see in small bits how the story would originally have unfolded, with all its dark and evil twists to it. This is often seen through different characters, which helps shape the characters perspective to the world and their relations to each other.Another thing they also do in a great way, is showing how the main character Pride reflects over the changes she makes to the original story. We see both how she sees the changes and have hope for the future, but also how her destiny is pressuring her.The relations of the characters develop throughout the season, but not in a way that is out of the ordinary. So character progression is decent throughout it, just not necessarily the most interesting part of the anime.The animation is slightly above average, with it seeming more clean and colors more clear then average. Music is not really special, but the opening has a good pace to it.So overall is it a nice anime that does the Josei genre proud, just not anything really impressive.

And I tried to like this, I swear I did. It's a great villainess reincarnation story, the soundtrack was fitting, voice acting was great, and the art and animation were all nice to look at. You know the problem I had with this anime? Everything was just so c r i...n g e y-- like all these lines Pride says to her adopted brother (also what was the deal with that? bro got kidnapped and forced to be a prince and he was sad for a little bit but i'm confused why he was okay with it later), her knight, the criminal guy, they were supposed to be very, heartfelt, emotional, empathetic lines but all I felt was cringe and embarrassment. Like I like cliche lines but they were just so cringey that I couldn't help but actually screech when watching it. I love the trope, I love the execution of OP female MC, but man, the show was just so cringey that it lowkey hurt to watch it.So did I enjoy it? Occasionally. But would not recommend if you're not into some reverse harem type of stuff, if you cringe easily... but you know, feel free to give it a try. If the first few episodes don't make you cringe, then maybe you can handle the rest of the series. n g e y-- like all these lines Pride says to her adopted brother (also what was the deal with that? bro got kidnapped and forced to be a prince and he was sad for a little bit but i'm confused why he was okay with it later), her knight, the criminal guy, they were supposed to be very, heartfelt, emotional, empathetic lines but all I felt was cringe and embarrassment.

HOWEVER, i thoroughly enjoyed this anime and would love to see more of it. Why? Well, let me explain.First of all, I have watched what I feel is the most popular version of this type of anime, ""My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!"". The one thing I had issues with that anime is the issue that separates ok anime and great anime. That is the attention to building characters and the world. For an extreme example let\'s look at...an anime that does an excellent job with world-building but falls somewhat short of characters. That would be ""Log Horizon"". The reverse is Too much character and not enough world-building. For that, I would have to say ""Welcome to the NHK"" or ""Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions"" Because by the end of it you feel like the characters are almost family. You feel for them.Usually, in isekai anime, you will receive some world-building. Then introductions to characters and then the anime just speeds off into the future. This leaves the interest in characters and the world hollow. That is the reason why near the end of the story you feel bored or annoyed. The characters do not feel like they have lived but are instead 2D representations of themselves.With that being said for context I believe that this anime has nailed the introduction and character development to be very good. It does not feel like the pacing was too fast or too slow. Characters actually feel like people and you have time to feel and learn about them. So in comparison to ""My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!"" This anime is perfect! With proper pacing, the second season is an excellent place to start the story in this case. You have learned about most of the characters and feel like the story will matter. Which is the way it should be. I hope this anime continues for at least 2 more seasons. It is a rare find in the isekai genre. Truly something I enjoy seeing.IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT WATCHING THIS ANIME THEN WATCH IT! an anime that does an excellent job with world-building but falls somewhat short of characters.

But I can\'t say that I am enjoying this anime so far.Good points of this anime are the premise of a more serious and darker variation of ""I got reincarnated as a villainess in an otome game universe"" We had My Next Life as a Villainess and we also got I\'m the Villainess, So I\'m Taming the Final Boss which tackled the premise but on a lighter and more humorous note, but this one seems to have an MC where the one hey highjack...is a genuinely horrid person (to an almost comical degree mind you)Now bad points....it\'s boring. the pacing is bad, the characters are just maybe 1 step above being flat paper characters, and our dear MC...I just don\'t care much for her personality.It\'s like the moment she went into the original Pride\'s body she immediately acts like she is really the original Pride, despite the fact that she still has the mental link of her original world and that she\'s inside a game universe, she keeps lamenting about how horrible she\'s gonna be in the future......despite the knowledge of NOT being the same game Pride at all. Does she think she\'s gonna be brainwashed into being evil? This kind of worked with My Next Life as a Villainess since Katarina is a confirmed dumbass (there\'s a reason her nickname is Bakarina with the fans) and the series doesn\'t take itself seriously but the level of denseness just doesn\'t work with this anime it just makes Pride look inconsistent about it.Now currently we are more than halfway into this anime, and we are still in the backstory mode of seeing the MC rewrite the game plot, now we don\'t know what will happen once we are on the \'present\' game scene but maybe things will get better, who knows. is a genuinely horrid person (to an almost comical degree mind you)Now bad points....it\'s boring. the pacing is bad, the characters are just maybe 1 step above being flat paper characters, and our dear MC...I just don\'t care much for her personality.It\'s like the moment she went into the original Pride\'s body she immediately acts like she is really the original Pride, despite the fact that she still has the mental link of her original world and that she\'s inside a game universe, she keeps lamenting about how horrible she\'s gonna be in the future......despite the knowledge of NOT being the same game Pride at all.

When The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen From Villainess to Savior got announced, it became obvious that the otome experiment has been a success and opened up a new realm of possibilities. Based on the web novel of the same name, we are greeted with perhaps a heretical anime that we didn\'t know we wanted.The otome fantasy genre has a very familiar formula and that involves some sort of villainess from a video game in the past. Then, a faithful event happens that gives that character a second...chance to live their life but in a new timeline in a new body. In this case, we meet Pride Royal Ivy who goes through this phase. With her knowledge of the past, Pride Royal Ivy tries to change her fate and his is another all too familiar theme of fantasy otome in recent years.Can I just say that the names of the characters in this show has gotten a bit peculiar? Pride Royal Ivy sounds more like the title of a military unit or commander than a villainess. Yet, Ivy does have a sense of pride in herself and tries her best to revert her fate of a ""bad ending"". Indeed, the show wants us to root for Ivy because that\'s her main goal. As we follow her journey across the show, it became obvious that she tried to make herself completely different from the original Ivy. Through efforts, she proves herself to be a worthy character capable of showing compassion, kindness, and helping the helpless. From a character perspective, she earns the respect and friendships of other characters who would likely not be her friend from the original timeline. Among the most prominent of these friends is Slate, who she originally forced him to commit heinous acts in the past. Now in the present, they form a friendship that can be described as loyal and geninue. Yet Pride herself is not without flaws. She tries to put too much responsibility on her shoulders and sometimes faces immense pressure. This results in miscalculated acts that jeopardizes problems. It\'s later evident that she cannot change everything herself and that fate sometimes is more than just a game.For Ivy, her influence varies throughout the show from changing fates of characters from her past and altering her own future. What does make Ivy herself somewhat unique is that her original character is the embodiment of evil, or at least in her world. Obviously, the Ivy we come to know in the present is a complete foil of her former self. But at the same time, there are glimpses of her past that still haunts Ivy in the present day. To me, this anime is a darker version of the typical otome isekai show. It takes its elements and goes on a much more dramatic route than just saving people or changing a timeline. It\'s about altering the very fabric of reality and facing the truth. We should recognize the author wanted us to experience the feeling of despair, even when changes are successful. Ivy is also not exactly what I call a noble protagonist even if in her mind, she is ""doing the right thing"".Ultimately, you need to ask yourself if this type of show is aimed correctly for you. Because in some instances, it borrows many elements from otome isekai in today\'s industry but also throws in a few unique twists. Ivy herself can be a mixed reception as she is far too dimensional and lacks distinct traits despite her personality change. The relationship between her and Stale is meaningful but isn\'t a main focus throughout the show. In other words, this anime puts more emphasis on plot than relationships and that might not be everyone\'s cup of tea. Other characters such as Clark and Arthur represents what they are: supporting cast. Unfortunately, this show has an overemphasis on Ivy that most of the other cast is overshadowed even someone such as Tiara. If you don\'t find Ivy\'s character appealing, then we got some problems.Admitingly, I was neither disappointed or impressed by the animation quality of the adaptation. The studio seems to adapt the characters at a fundamental level that made them feel believable. Among this, Ivy\'s scarlet hair represents her determination while the rest of the cast are given an elegant look with noble qualities. Despite the genres and themes, the show isn\'t too heavy into fantasy so don\'t expect heavy action backed by a budget. Instead, it\'s a pretty standard adaptation with the look of an otome isekai.The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen From Villainess to Savior shows that even though otome isekai isn\'t dying off the industry any time soon, it hasn\'t set a massive standard yet.

', ""My Next Life NOT as the Villainess.The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen: From Villainess to Savior is another in the increasingly common sub-genre of isekai where an ordinary Japanese girl gets hit by Truck-kun, reincarnates as the villainess of her favourite game/visual novel and tries not to be evil so she doesn’t die a horrible death at the hands of the protagonist and her reverse harem. Or bisexual harem in the case of Bakarina.Unlike others in its genre, Last Boss Queen goes for a more melodramatic tone rather than comedic. Reincarnated princess Pride Royal Ivy uses her knowledge of the visual novel as a...substitute for her visual novel counterpart's ability to see into the future. Whenever she changes something from the original story timeline the former victims of the villainess's cruelty see visions of the absurdly monstrous deeds she inflicts upon them from the original timeline. She also uses her Last Boss cheat abilities such as being good with a sword and a gun to help and save her subjects instead of torturing them.The story itself is fine and I found myself engrossed more or less with every episode, but I think some of the writing takes the melodrama a bit too far. For example, Pride feels way too guilty for the things she hasn’t done yet by her character in the visual novel which comes across as weird rather than emotional, and although there were times the character's plights and outbursts got me, others were either obnoxious or where drawn out for way too long.That said, I liked the cast. Pride is a more competent Bakarina and her relationships with her siblings Stale and Tiara and her knight Arthur are very wholesome. I also liked one of the villains, Val who is an awesome heel and general shit-stirrer between the four of them which is always fun to watch.The show does some pretty interesting things with its narrative too. I already talked about characters seeing visions of their potential torture at the hands of Pride and I like the way Pride setups precautions in case of the event she turns into a tyrant when she inherits the throne. These little nuggets of interesting foreshadowing are what kept me interested and I would like to see how they pay off with a second season.There's also quite a bit of barefoot kissing and licking… if you’re into that… Quentin Tarantino would approve. That’s got nothing to do with me wanting a second season. I just thought I should put a little disclaimer for people not into that.Even with its average light-novel-level animation and good art The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen: From Villainess to Savior is a pretty fun watch. It is rough around the edges thanks to some of the writing, but it has some good ideas and despite its wrong edges I enjoyed myself. It's on the cusp of 7/10 but for now…6/10 It’s Okay. substitute for her visual novel counterpart's ability to see into the future.

She even acknowledges that she is capable of doing so, and she continues doing so across the entire season.

This series had great potential with its basic idea. Namely, that a Japanese office worker gets reincarnated as Princess Pride. A princess who will grow up to become a genuinely evil, psychotic tyrant. A tyrant destined to be killed by those she tormented. To save herself, our protagonist has to avoid this fate and she chooses to do this by doing the exact opposite of the Tyrant whose body she now posses- to be a good ruler. Now this is  not an original idea for a Villainess Isekai story. But, unlike many such stories, the...original Princess Pride is not a generic  rich girl bully but a genuinely irredeemable tyrant. This could have been an excellent plot point with the main protagonist taking control of Pride after Pride has committed some reversible acts. This would have made new Pride's (as I will call the girl who is reincarnated into Princess Prides body) journey towards redemption challenging and worth watching. This would have been a more compelling story as many of the characters in the series would have genuine reason to hate Pride, thus creating a challenge for our protagonist to overcome. Instead, New Pride takes over original, Prides body before original Pride was old enough to do anything bad at all and so New Pride being nice to people is more than enough to solve the problem. In fact, New Pride is too nice. In  stark contrast to the original Pride, New Pride has not a single bad bone in her body and so New Prides constant worrying that might slip into old Prides evil ways feels almost ludicrous. As for all of Prides would be murderers? Because new Pride took over before original Pride did anything, these would be regicides now practically worship Pride as the best thing since sliced bread. And all  because Pride was nice to them. The show essentially resolves its own conflict in the first few episodes leaving the rest of the series to turn into little more than flattery for the main protagonist. The closest to a conflict we see is the flashbacks that show what the original Pride did in certain situations. However,  even this has little effect as we are soon treated to new Pride doing the exact opposite and solving everything. Because of this, what could have been a compelling and interesting series wasted its potential, and instead we get a 12 episode long power fantasy with very little conflict were a morally perfect protagonist wins over almost everyone. By the time I watched the last episode, the series felt so repetitive boring that I was glad it was over. The same basic plot happened over and over again with no hint of a challenge.In general, Last Boss Queen had an excellent premise but little else.

Of course the princess is overpowered in not only her foresight, which is an actual ability her character has and not just her memory of the game, but can basically do any skill perfectly (which is explained as her being able to do because she's the final boss). She teleported into the middle of a battlefield and took out a bunch of people with guns by herself, as an 11 year old, so she's definitely a Mary Sue. "", 'One should open with the positive sides and descend to the negative ones so here we go-The best part of this anime for me was, unexpectedly, the ending song- ""Pride"" by ChoQMay.One thing I love from within the story is the friendship and yet rivalry dynamic of Arthur and Stale, though they could expand much more upon this friendship. But at least it\'s wholesome.This anime has all the tropes of the reincarnation genre, and this is coming from someone who has been reading manga and manhwa of this genre for the past 3 years without getting tired of it, but these tropes are executed poorly....The tropes- suddenly remembering memories from the previous life and knowing the future events of the current life, reverse harem consisting of men of a wide range of ages with questionable relationships with the mc, general theme of mc winning everyone\'s love and respect by being a good person- these are all fine if executed well, to be honest. The mc is saving so many lives all within such a short amount of time that it\'s baffling honestly. From literally saving Arthur\'s dad, Val, and Gilbert\'s fiance, to indirectly changing Arthur, Gilbert and (again) Val\'s lives, mc is always saving people by saying ""But you\'re also a citizen of my country, you\'re all my people"". Like, yes, saving people is a good thing in general, but how come every single person she comes across needs her to save their life? And then they\'re always so moved by her act of kindness that they\'re quite literally kissing and *licking* her feet? I don\'t know about anyone else but the scene with Val, a fully grown adult, licking her bare foot is something I could not digest, specially since the last episode was a filler one, it was not in the manga as far as I remember. So there was no need for this scene, but here we are.And another huge theme of this anime is the concept of ""protection"". It\'s just really sad that Stale and Arthur are literally dedicating their whole lives to protect someone who needs no such protection. I mean, yeah, sure, Stale has been politically protecting Pride for a long time now. But honestly speaking, the only political problem that was shown was Gilbert spreading rumours about Pride to bring the other courtesans to his side so that his law gets passed. And that was solved, yet again, by Pride saving Gilbert\'s fiance (and now he is eternally loyal to the throne), and not by Stale doing any protection. And then we have Arthur who is supposed to be her ""sword"". Now, yes, Arthur is going to be the strongest knight in the future and he\'d be able to defeat even Pride. But all this talk about Stale and Arthur protecting Pride when Pride is solving all her problems by saving other people\'s lives makes these two look quite purposeless. In fact, how can Arthur even protect Pride when Pride keeps on jumping off of cliffs (to save Val) and diving headfirst into all sorts of problems other than those which require physical strength or sword skills? And even when sword skills are required, Pride currently has much better skills than anyone (I mean she deflects bullets with the tip of her sword, I think I can rest my case here). So why is Arthur\'s strength even needed? It might be needed in the future if, and we all know it won\'t happen, Pride ever becomes evil. But even that is such a far away future that it all ends up making Arthur look more useless than Stale. Useless might be a bit too harsh, he\'s a sweetheart, but objectively speaking, his character is contributing nothing to the plot.What\'s more, Arthur doesn\'t even feel like he\'s the main male target here, when he\'s the one, among all the other harem members, who probably has more understandable circumstances to actually be with Pride. But that\'s a different topic, I\'m not gonna dive in to the ship hole. My point is that, Arthur and Stale are practically frothing at the mouth by saying how much they want to protect Pride from all possible problems in every episode in every 5 minutes, and yet they have never been shown to actually protect her from anything. You might think it\'s because they\'re still learning and bettering themselves, which I\'m sure they are; however, what, then, is the point of their characters in the story? Other than being harem members, of course. They talk too much about protecting and yet the story is not allowing them to protect Pride from anything at all. Pride has the physical strength, sword skills, and even her political sense is good enough for her age.And they keep throwing in more and more characters who are saved in various ways by Pride. Are there no way to win people over other than literally saving their life or majorly changing the course of it? The characters ended up existing for the sake of being saved by Pride and flatly speaking, they lack depth. Also why did they not flesh out the relationship between Pride\'s parents and the three children? That could\'ve been so interesting, specially since it\'s a matriarchal kingdom! Instead, we have Pride running around to save everyone she comes across, which is, again, a great thing to do as a crown princess; but for her to jump off the cliff to save Val- man, I was expecting Stale and Pride to be grounded, and Arthur suspended from his duties for a month at least, for the reckless behavior they showed for people who would be leading the country soon. This plot point could\'ve been used to gently teach them about their priorities and alternative methods that would have achieved a similar result with a lot less risk. But oh well, if the prince and the crown princess of the country don\'t risk their lives to save trafficked children, how could they possibly hope to win the trust of a criminal? And again, this takes away the gravity of importance from the person who actually runs the country- the queen, Pride\'s mother. What was she doing when her children were in that cave with the human traffickers? How does a queen of a kingdom not have spies who would at least bring intelligence from within the palace, if not from outside the palace?Or I\'m just thinking too much for the sake of an anime. But if these points were pondered upon more carefully, I\'m sure the tropes could play out much better, I wouldn\'t have to cringe every 5 seconds, and the overall plot would be much more enjoyable.

We get to see everyone talking to eachother and spend time getting invested in all of the relationships. This is the major reason I loved this anime, despite plot being fairly lack-luster and straightforward. The characters are allowed to have emotions and react to things, and characters are allowed to have meaningful conversations even when the main character isn\'t there.As I said, the plot is simple and easy to follow, and it\'s definitely a feel-good fluffy iseki rather than a an in-depth political thriller.The only drawback other than the plot is...the love triangle. To be fair, I have seen a lot worse in the love triangle/harem department. At least these one is subtle (ish) and they haven\'t gone ""oh actually you can marry multiple people"" as a solution. The two love interests are both compelling characters in their own rights, and the development of their relationships with the protag feel fairly natural. the love triangle.

Something I can turn my brain off for a bit and watch. HOWEVER, immediately after she meets the male mc. It got weird VERY fast.(SPOILERS)WHY would they make them have an incestuous relationship with each other other?!?!?!? And you can say ""but they aren\'t really related"" all you want but that made my rating drop from a 6 to a 2. If they had just stayed on the course the show was going without mentioning how these CHILDREN are supposed to provide their kingdom with an heir, it would have been an ok show. ', ""For the first episode I watched it with full hope that it would be good, but after I noticed it was getting boring, Remembering too much about what MC has done in the past, keeps crying because he regrets what he did.Remembering too much about the storyline in the game, if it will be like this, or will be like that, every action always brings up past memories in the game, and this applies to episode 1, it's very, very boring.For episode 2, the storyline has been replaced with a small child who was supposed to be a slave in MC's past. Episode 3...is filled with battles, are you serious? It's nothing, there's already a riot, plus scenes that are too far-fetched, You think I'll feel sad about that dramatic scene? After what I saw in the first episode, of course my mood for watching dropped drastically, So the placement of the contrived drama in episode 3 is useless.The character design is also sometimes not perfect, Princess Pride looks mature, but sometimes she still looks like a child. Even though it was originally a child, why does the design always change to make it look like an adult? I don't really care about that because the story alone is already bad. is filled with battles, are you serious?

There is no arguing about it.Animation & Artstyle: 5.5/10The art style is actually pretty decent, nothing jaw-breaking but it has good details, and I like the character designs, plus the contrast is actually pretty good compared to the pastel colour grading that other otome game anime usually have. But, the animation is pretty bad; The choreography makes the characters stiff, especially in fights, and the cinematography is quite plain as well.Sound design & Music: 7.5/10The overall sound design is rather bland, but the soundtrack is actually...quite good.Story & Characters: 2/10I don't know about the original novel, but I have to say, the writing in this anime is god-awful, just terrible. The plot itself is unoriginal. The characters are extremely shallow and often do things that shouldn't be possible at all. It's like the author has never met and interacted with real human beings, and only knows them through anime. quite good.Story & Characters: 2/10I don't know about the original novel, but I have to say, the writing in this anime is god-awful, just terrible.

It's like the author has never met and interacted with real human beings, and only knows them through anime."", ""I will keep it simple.This anime is a cheap copy of My Next Life as a Villainess. I'm not even going to elaborate on the fact that the script is inferior, that the story has a lot of plot holes, or that the characters are annoying and dumb as a bag of rocks. Nothing makes sense when it comes to the plot of this monstrosity. Instead, I would like to introduce you to one particular character, which should be enough to understand that whoever wrote the script is an idiot. Oh, and it's a light novel adaptation, so technically someone with the name or pen...name Tenichi was responsible for the story. However, this does not absolve those responsible for the production of this anime of responsibility for how the end result looks, as this is a different medium and they could have changed the story to make it not as awful as it is.So whom am I talking about? About a boy named Stale. He is to become the adopted brother of the main character because of his special ability. He can teleport, and let me tell you one thing, the only word that comes to mind when talking about this whole plot with abilities is cringe. But back on topic, what's so bad about his character arc? Well, let's start with the fact that he is a peasant who becomes the adopted son of the current imperial ruling family. Only to become something of an assistant to the head heroine. Do not think too deeply about it, the author wanted to create a copy of Keith, but even that he could not do well.What's next? Oh well, he is kidnapped and forced to forge some kind of magical pact with his new family, making it impossible for him to escape. Which technically makes him a slave. But our main character says a few kind words to him, and that's enough for him to get rid of any malicious emotions directed toward his usurpers, and start supporting his new older sister with a wry smile. And finally, I can't even describe how much I laughed the moment Stale read the letter from his biological mother. He was so uplifted and happy, and so was his new family, everyone laughed as if nothing bad had happened. Everyone absolutely forgets about the fact that he is a slave who was brought here against his will, he cannot defy his rulers, and this letter, oh god. They let the real Stale mother write to him once a year... ONCE A YEAR! And he is happy about it like it wasn't this family that forbade him to contact his biological mother in the first place.My biggest conundrum is why the author copie-, I mean wrote that Stale will be Pride's brother. Oh yeah, the main character's name is Pride, and it's a terrible name that I only associate with FMA. And the thing is, that the whole plot would have made a lot more sense if Stale had actually been treated as a slave in the service of the imperial family, rather than as a member of it. Then the kindness of the main character would actually mean something, and the stupid restrictions that were imposed on Stale would actually make sense.Ending this review which turned out to be a little longer than I planned. Because it's a copy of My Next Life as a Villainess, Pride was an evil and violent character before she had awakened memories of the game. Which is funny because she was also a much more interesting character back then. For example, she forced Stale to sign something that made him completely obey Pride, under the pretense that Pride would let him see his mother. And she wasn't lying, the catch was that she made him kill his mother with his own hands. Like man, if that was the actual story I'd be happy to watch it.Anyway, the plot is garbage, worldbuilding is nonexistent, and character development doesn't make sense. I dunno, go watch the original. name Tenichi was responsible for the story.
