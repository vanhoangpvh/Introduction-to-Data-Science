You don\'t need to read it to watch this, I didn\'t. definitely romantic with no conflict whatsoever. Pure fluff. Its literally like 15 mins maybe.The art style is simple and clean and very beautiful. I think the limited colors really add to the whole ""this isn\'t a full story but just a piece of their life together"" vibe. You can really tell who the characters are even with such limited run time based on how they look and how they...interact with each other.I like how it wasn\'t a super dramatic romance, and it showed playful banter between the two characters like what would be in a real relationship.Def rated PG-13, especially the 3rd episode. There\'s nothing graphic but just a warning I suppose.

I honestly think this is as good as a short story can get, genuinely!When you think of short anime, you don't exactly expect something to be super engaging. These types of animation tend to go through its motions pretty quickly, telling a story in as rushed of a manner as possible (or not even telling a story at all). Semantic Error goes about it in another way: it bets on simplicity, and telling a whole story from just a quick glimpse into the world without needlessly rushing it. And ooohh boy, it...delivers so much and more! Here you get pretty art, beautiful animation, great acting and a couple with instant chemistry. I can't praise it enough, so please go watch it right now! delivers so much and more! Here you get pretty art, beautiful animation, great acting and a couple with instant chemistry.

Kaidan Restaurant,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6980/Kaidan_Restaurant,"['Kids anime? Based on my opinion as a 15 year old im against the fact that this is kids anime. At a first glance it doesnt seem all that scary,but i was mistaken.When i watched the first episode, it pretty much creeped me out so i watched the next and then the next and the next and the next.Each episode is split into 3 sections.The two stories will be about ako and weird phenomenons that happen to her and her friends.The 3rd part will be aghost story told by ako and her friends.Some may just be a little weird and creepy but to be honest...some actually frightened me a little.Some of the stories are interesting and i certainly enjoyed most of them.Although the art maybe not be up to expectations it would be considered average but it cant be compared to all the really detailed new animes.The back ground music really fits the situation and might give u a fright at certain parts.In my humble opinion i say that it is an enjoyable anime and each story is pretty much just a story on its own. This anime has no story line so dont expect one :P some actually frightened me a little.Some of the stories are interesting and i certainly enjoyed most of them.Although the art maybe not be up to expectations it would be considered average but it cant be compared to all the really detailed new animes.The back ground music really fits the situation and might give u a fright at certain parts.In my humble opinion i say that it is an enjoyable anime and each story is pretty much just a story on its own. This anime has no story line so dont expect one :P', 'The first episodes haven\'t impressed me much - they were nor annoying, nor special. But for some reason I continued watching and unexpectedly began to enjoy it. I can\'t say I\'ve ever liked ghost stories and stuff and, fortunately, it didn\'t matter - \'cause the stories told in this anime aren\'t scary at all. In fact, it\'s not the storytelling which makes you watch this show. As for me, I was delighted by the number of various myths and legends  collected in these episodes: I\'ve even recognised 2 russian fairytales, which are very familiar to me \'cause I\'m from Ukraine :) So it\'s one...more way to learn about japanese culture and people\'s customs.Summarizing, it\'s not an anime which makes millions of people  scream ""What will happen next?"". Though, I believe many people will find it enjoyable to learn something new about Japan and will relax for at least 20 minutes watching calm fairy-tales. Looking forward to downloading the new ep! more way to learn about japanese culture and people\'s customs.Summarizing, it\'s not an anime which makes millions of people  scream ""What will happen next?"". Though, I believe many people will find it enjoyable to learn something new about Japan and will relax for at least 20 minutes watching calm fairy-tales. Looking forward to downloading the new ep!', 'TL;DR+ story variety+ surprisingly enjoyable- ""is this really from 2009?"" visuals- some annoying stereotypic characters- ass-pullsStoryStory is about 3 middle schoolers telling or experiencing some classic japanese horror stories. Each episode is split in 3 parts, something that happens to them, something they tell and 1-2 minute short. When you see horror tag in anime, it usually means a lot of blood or human torture. Your classic horror movies often rely on on jump scares - woman walks down the dark halway of her house with only flashlight, nothing but her footsteps are heard, suddenly killer appears behind her with loud ""bang"" ambience and you...get scared just for that moment. I\'m glad these stories are different - they build up tension just to leave you creeped out at the end.Few problems I had - to me they often felt unfinished, like they tried to squeeze as much as possible into their allocated time. Also, I was surprised how often were authors bringing up the concept of death, since this is basically kids series. And because this is kids show, none of the characters died despite being really close to it, thanks to some randomness that occured. Don\'t get me wrong, I didn\'t want to see them die, but it was killing the tension - whenever someone was about to die, you just knew he\'ll be fine.ArtProbably the weakest point. Animation was pretty weak, backgrounds and character design simplistic, those ghosts/monsters more often than not, uninteresting.SoundEnding was ok, no opening. Surprising right? How dares a japanese show to not have an opening theme! Actually it had something similar - shows you as guest going to thriller restaurant, where ghosts and monsters present you menu with some ""creepy"" foods, while playing ""classy mansion"" ambience in the background. Was supposed to serve slight comedic purpose - didn\'t work on me, as those food names sounded incredibly cheesy. Left me with ""what the hell are you trying to do with this"" feeling every time.Background sounds were nice and atmospheric, except for one or two which sounded awfuly generic. (can\'t exactly remember)CharacterCharacter development is close to 0. This isn\'t surprising as each episode is a standalone set of stories. As main you have this trio of kids - scaredy cat, who likes stories, tsundere girl who doesn\'t believe in ghosts but always tags along because ""it can\'t be helped"" and a blondie boy, who usually saves the day. There are few more of their classmates, but they don\'t always play a role in episode.So I didn\'t like 2 out of this main trio. The tsundere girl - she always has evidence right in front of her yet still refused to believe in ghosts. It\'s like she knew she\'s in anime or something. Also her ""high class"" image was annoying 9.9 out of 10 times. The blondie guy was mostly the story teller and life saver. This is literally how few stories went:girlX: ""Nice weather today.""blondie: ""That reminds me of this story I read the other day..."" *story begins*Yeah he\'s that kind of guy. And his saves seemed way too random and pulled out of nowhere.EnjoymentDespite the bad stuff I mentioned, show is surprisingly enjoyable. Each story is unique and will leave you little bit creeped out. Therefore was fun to watch (except for occasional annoyance from few characters).OverallDo you like horror stories? How about classic japanese horror stories? Then please don\'t get put off by ""kids"" tag, as it shouldn\'t stop you from enjoying this little piece of work.Although, I can\'t help but think how much better this could be, would they drop the kiddy aspect and made it more like Yami Shibai but animated, or Aoi Bungaku Series but episodic. get scared just for that moment.

MAL says it's picture books but it's actually short story collections, each story goes for about 10 to 12 pages and every other story has an illustration to go along with it. I've personally read about 10 or so of these books and I feel like the anime does a very good job translating the material to animation.The books and the anime are actually a sort of modern take on several classic horror,...folktale stories and more modern urban legends. Most have Japanese sources but there are a good number of European stories as well. If you have any interest in Japanese literature, especially related to the weird, folk tales and horror, then you'll recognize a lot of these. Some of the stories are based on sources as old as the Konjaku Monogatarishu and Ugetsu Monogatari compilations. Some are based on very modern urban legends related to technology, like being able to talk to the dead through a cell phone, creatures from the Beyond being able to use TV signals to cross dimensions, etc.Although it's a show written for children, you would be surprised how it doesn't shun away from a lot of things a show like this in the West would do. Children actually die in tragic ways here. This is not a spoiler, just a warning. It's also very well written, setting a good precedent; it's not because it's for children that it needs to be lazy, uninteresting and avoid exploring themes like death, loss, pain, tragedy and the like. Just remember, it is a show for kids first, so it won't wallow in depressing themes, but it uses well to tell the stories it wants to tell. It explores all these things very well and in a very Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai-ish way. That's how it usually starts; the 3 main characters, Shou, Ako and Reiko get together, usually after seeing something weird. Shou remembers a story relating to that event and tells it to the other characters. Sometimes the characters themselves go investigate whatever weird thing that happened in their town or in their school. Most episodes are divided into 3 stories, sometimes 2 and a couple of episodes have a single story.This show was extremely popular in Japan in its demographic and it's easy to see why. For adults however, it might require a little bit of persistence. Some stories are rather mild and an episode here and there can be a little dull, but if you keep going, there are very good tales to go through, some quite tragic and emotionally charged. Each story is self contained so you can skip the ones you don't like, just make sure to watch the last episode. It's a very nice one and it gives some development to one of the main characters.Each episode gets a little intro by Garcon, the ghost who runs the Kaidan Restaurant. In the books he serves the same purpose, welcoming\xa0 the main character of each story as he or she enters the restaurant to tell or be told a horror story. Here however, he just introduces the stories with the help of other supernatural creatures, but they happen in other places. He's also played by Mr. Hirata Hiroaki, one of the most charming male voices in the industry today.Going with this show's premise of introducing each story as dishes, I think this anime is a good palate cleanser. If you watched something very somber or depressing, or if you just watched something too cute and excessively sweet or silly, then I think you'll enjoy going through this, especially if you're into horror. There's also a movie out there but what this really deserves is a second season. All in all, it's a very satisfying show to go through. folktale stories and more modern urban legends.

Neither is entirely untrue, however surprisingly these apparent shortcomings do not detract from the enjoyment this show provides.The series lacks a definitive overarching plot and rather consists of an anthology of horror stories centered around a group of school children and the town they live in. The stories are presented by the manager of the Kaidan restaurant to the viewers. They may be experienced or narrated by the protagonists. Though almost none of these stories are genuinely frightening, they...do have their slightly unnerving moments; some even border on the emotional rather than the supernatural.Also the inclusion of several folktales and traditional ghost stories not only from Japan but from around the globe, makes for a delectable recipe.Not having seen the live-action movie that followed the anime, I do not know if the story continues or not; but I would like to know more about the Ghastly Garcon and his connection to Ako, which was hinted at in the last episode.Overall a delightful series which may be far from perfect, but serves its purpose decently and provides a welcome relief from continuously watching serious plot-heavy stories in anime.Score :7/10Recommended.P.S. I absolutely loved the ending theme song, LOST BOY. do have their slightly unnerving moments; some even border on the emotional rather than the supernatural.Also the inclusion of several folktales and traditional ghost stories not only from Japan but from around the globe, makes for a delectable recipe.Not having seen the live-action movie that followed the anime, I do not know if the story continues or not; but I would like to know more about the Ghastly Garcon and his connection to Ako, which was hinted at in the last episode.Overall a delightful series which may be far from perfect, but serves its purpose decently and provides a welcome relief from continuously watching serious plot-heavy stories in anime.Score :7/10Recommended.P.S.

Back in the 90s, when I was a kid, that was the only tv-series that showed ghost stories to kids / teens.This is clearly the present-day (& anime) variant of that series, presenting ghost stories to kids & teens.

Kaiketsu Zorro,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3010/Kaiketsu_Zorro,"[""Not a single review yet on this anime. I'm not surprised. I know how many people will watch this series regardless of a review, so let me inform you that my intention is really just to rake up and reflect on my childhood days as well as to contribute a little to this anime, (not to mention I was immensely bored as well) but don't underestimate this.The Legend of Zorro. 'Another ripoff' is what you might think. That's not the case (atleast not completely). This is hardly the type of anime you'd come across, even while searching randomly. Nor is it something you would give...a second look or thought about. I ran into this series years ago when it was airing on the local TV channel (hindi dubbed) and I can honestly say that my ten year old self waited eagerly everyday for a new episode of 'Zorro'.There is a plot, yes. The series focuses on the prevailing tortures and injustice dealt to the villagers and the townspeople by the army. Then, naturally, our coward of a protagonist (or so it seems) Diego, clenches his fist at this unsightly behavior and behold: the next day a hero emerges on a white horse with a black cloak (guess who) who goes around whipping big 'Zs' on the soldiers' uniforms. And I never got tired of the repeated scenes where Zorro's whipping the Zs on the officers/lieutenants and sometimes, making their pants fall down.And so, naturally, our hero can't just keep his identity to himself. There's a 'Little Zorro' as well who stays by his side and continuously helps him in his missions and also plays a major role later on. Then more naturally, the hero is incomplete without a heroine, so therein steps the beautiful but egotistic Lolita who shows a deep reluctancy towards Diego but harbors an equally deep admiration for 'Zorro' (cliche much?). However, Zorro's persona as Diego, is shown brilliantly. His hilarious interactions is part of the series' comedy relief.This is the Blue ray era, so you can forget about ART. But I'll say this: The characters are drawn very well, even if you can immediately figure out the goodie, the baddie, the clever and the idiot.Sound is something I cannot judge clearly because the OP song comprised of an action instrumental and there was no ED at all. You can imagine a 50s movie where they put in the same gun-shots, screams and effects of  merchandise breaking  and played them over and over again for different scenes. It's not something highly noticeable though.There's a wide variety of characters in this one, many of them fillerish as the series is mostly episodic in nature. But there are a few prominent lingering ones, like Lieutenant Gabriel and Gonzalez who always end up embarrassing themselves whenever they face Zorro (and admittedly are the type with more potential towards goodness). There's the much bastard like Raymond, the head commander, Diego's family and some of Bernard's friends.I believe endings hold great importance to any series. You might predict this one to end in some funny/happy/idiotic note. However, the last few episodes is where the epic twists are born. From a light-hearted and lame action filled array of comedy, the series plunges into deep conflict and takes a somewhat tragic path in case of Zorro. The sudden change in behavior alarmed me. The change which occurred when you realised that the events had taken a turn towards utmost seriousness and now, even you couldn't guarantee whether the problems will be solved like pie as was the case with the previous episodes. But one thing I can guarantee is that the ending won't let you down. The most it can do is double your admiration for our black-cloaked and white suited hero.I started out this review thinking I'd be able to rough it up in barely a paragraph. Turns out that wasn't the case. It's been years since I last saw Zorro and it still comes back to me fresh as yesterday. It wasn't the best of the actions, but it was still worth it. It was stupid at times but it was still awesome.Everything about it will seem to put you off, but try getting an 8 year old to sit in front the TV and watch it. You'll be surprised.To all voters: feedback greatly appreciated a second look or thought about.

But that doesnt means its animation is poor. The animation is 'MASTERPIECE' of its time.In terms of plot, it...has 19 or 20th century backrground with sense of patriotism and other themes with swordplay and a great sense of humour.The plot gets interesting as strory unfolds and after some times, episodes become continuation to each other.With a classicical music theme and swordsplay and a touch of comedy,it is a must especially for those who loves protagonist with secret identity or historical series with classic story and action. has 19 or 20th century backrground with sense of patriotism and other themes with swordplay and a great sense of humour.The plot gets interesting as strory unfolds and after some times, episodes become continuation to each other.With a classicical music theme and swordsplay and a touch of comedy,it is a must especially for those who loves protagonist with secret identity or historical series with classic story and action."", 'Henshin sequence... Shot on a blond guy\'s face with blue eyes. Black jacket on, pimp boots next. A lightning streak tears off the sky to illuminate the unknown face... It sports a stern, unswerving determination. He is not here to joke around... Belts, gloves, masks and hat follows in a thunderbolts galore. Flipping his cape, swinging his foil, He\'s here!Who? A cosplaying Shirota Yuu?? No, the cunning fox of Spanish California, the one and only Zorro!!Does this outstanding way in announces a great adaptation? I want to answer yes and no. Let\'s elaborate more on exposition, beforehand. Some inexact points, you can notice in this...very webpage, need to be corrected. Kaiketsu Zorro is mainly a co-production between three countries: Toho Animation (Japan) / Mondo TV (Italy) / Royal Pictures Company (Switzerland). It\'s from a time when animation still was held in way good esteem outside of Japan\'s bounds. Nowadays, Mondo TV produces nothing and Royal Pictures Company limited went bankrupt in 2008 after 23 years of existence. While it benefited of international recognition, coming with substantial budget, this show isn\'t exactly of the calibre of a World Masterpiece Theater production. I\'ll explain you why with the following points.....| Story |.. 4/10The most critically flawed aspect. It\'s due to the lack of cohesion in direction. Indeed, storyline tend to loaf with filler episodes of relatively uninteresting workmanship (the ones where sergeant Gonzales/Garcia fall in love, this cheesetacular one where Zorro fences a shark...) to pick up suddenly the pace, as in the last arc where conclusion is rushed through regardless of its potential. It\'s like Toho or some other unindentified third party took over, upon realizing imminence of deadline, aware that this production is in need to show teeth to end at least half decently. Secondary intrigues often are disposed of, regardless of continuity. Thus, you can see Bernardo tie new friendships which aren\'t taken into account for the remainder of series.Format is at fault: independent episodes often gun down a franchise, if there\'s not a strong director to back them all under one flag. It\'s difficult to tell who was at the commands. Sometimes, it seems like the Japanese had a blast, making one tribute to Kaiju-eiga (if Toho isn\'t behind it, I don\'t know who is!!)... While in other instances, quite conventional angles transects these wild fits of fantasy as in an attempt to stick back with Johnston McCulley\'s spirit. In conclusion, due to how anime was produced, it\'s perpetually seated between two chairs. Does it want to be comedic with Boke/Tsukkomi routine? Does it want to be badass looking? Does it want to be oneiric? Plotline definitely lacks a common thread, so it falls short as one influence short circuits another...| Art |.. 8/10Takaya Hirotoshi\'s chara-design is rock solid. It\'s impossible to confuse one protagonist with another. For instance, Commandant Ramon has that subtle, handsome and yet silently ominous expression about him. Lieutenant Gabriel really looks like a smug douchebag with his top student air, while Don Alexandro has a austere and yet venerable look. The vast array of design is one top quality this series have.Art Direction is uneven. at times, sceneries are downright amazing!They have that Ghibli-like touch, as for the episode 19 with that mechanically redesigning house, The south India company headquarters or the docks full of Spanish gallions. A certain contrast strikes in when action pans over the dull town. Once again, At the reins of background art, two persons... Miyamae Mitsuharu, a veteran on this position, signs hands out best part. I doubt more about Giuliana Bertozzi\'s talent. She\'s certainly decent but her touch doesn\'t exactly show overall...| Animation |.. 6/10Whereas episode animation is fluid most of the time, quality critically slacks down at times, to the point of being shoddy. One example: the son of an assaulted landlord is chased as he\'s suspected in an assassination attempt. Upon escaping residence, the immediate soldier after him dashes... Like a drunkard. At one frames, he even inexplicably ends up in an axis way too outcentered of his course, on the right side. There happens to be a certain amount of continuity errors as well, when you focus attention on objects characters hold or background elements... I don\'t think key-animation is at fault. Only perhaps a couple of scatterbrained animators. Now, I know animation is dated, but there was noteworthy failures here and there explaining my low grade, as for the dance competition Lolita took on for her friend: staff was really off, expressing the sensuality of that performance above everything else...Indeed, these aren\'t unredeemable mistakes, but it\'s definitely sub-par with many other TV productions...| Sound |.. 6/10Fair. Music delivers overall a convincing chilvarous impression. Latino like guitars alternates with trumpets to stand for dynamic moments where Diego cease to be slacker to take on Zorro\'s persona. I like Zorro\'s theme, even if it weirdly channels City Hunter\'s spirit. The part coming after intro would perfectly fit with Ryo Saeba righting wrongs with magnum. The mystery theme, when Diego and Bernardo devise about situation, is one of the very best. I have also in mind the action theme, where a heartful electric guitar kicks in to insist on emergency aspect. Rest of the soundtrack is rather ambient. It lounges around mostly when nothing much happen. In a way, it makes good echo to the dull looking town, when nothing is troubled by some greedy capitalist or the army.I watched this anime with french dubs mostly. You can only picture how cheesy they are if you live by my place. That jeweller... He has an accent from the south which makes me burst in laughter everytime I hear it. Here, he is, the bandit from Carcassonne, ready to make California bows down on its knees! It\'s also very difficult to keep a straight face when that lady look to defend her father, who happens to paint faux-masterpieces. Well, think about fish seller in the market of Bagnolet for her voice. It immediately defuses dramatism of situation despite soldiers brutality. I yet wonder what was with dub team\'s running joke around the sergeant and his comb (?). All in all, I enjoyed myself a load! Nevertheless, for a more serious approach, it\'s better opting for the subbed version instead...| Character |.. 5/10Yes, the rate is low. On with positive aspects to finish with the less pleasant ones...I appreciate the evil mastermind of Ramon. The ruthless commander, main antagonist of the show, pulls the strings and manage to retain composure, even in dire straits. His equivalent in benevolent form, Diego/Zorro\'s portrayal is well drawn, as well. It\'s enjoyable to see that goofball changes attitude all of a sudden to take care of problems backstage like a true selfless badass. It\'s only a pity Lolita\'s suspicion about his double identity is so underplayed. Roots of the evil is Bernardo: either you will love him or hate him... To be fair, a mute adult\'s pantomime is too hard to translate into animation. So, I can see how storyboard came for a perfectly ""normal"" child approach here. Funny character on whom young spectators would love to identify as, and whatnot. The fact he becomes little Zorro needlessly inflates importance of his character, though. Moreover, it brings into disrepute dramatic build up of episodes. It\'s really not easy to take it a face value when you see him barge in with his equally masked bulldog (!!). Is it a detached joke as to about why supporting cast come to be so dumb to not recognize Zorro and his team despite body of hints? This could have been a funny take on on the original spirit of the series, if Lolita and others wouldn\'t look so unsurprised upon learning the truth. On other note, this makes the villains pass as too incompetent to be of real menace. That\'s a pity.In conclusion, Characterization is the mirror reflect of plotline. A certain cohesion lacks in their portrayal, due to anarchic direction...| Enjoyment |.. 7/10This series is a bundle of enjoyment, regardless of my critical insight. In spirit, it\'s rather respectful to the works of Johnston McCulley if you choose to ignore the many eyebrow raising elements. It\'s a light-hearted title, which would certainly be of help to decompress between a violent steampunk/gun and a dark action/cyberpunk addition. Just enjoy the ride on Viento\'s back at heart\'s content, as it\'s the only known Zorro anime will you ever get=)..| Content indications / Buzzwords |..Ketchup meter: Some characters die, but overall violence is mostly toned down.Ecchi meter: 0Fishing scene(s): 2 of them! Yay!POSITIVE aspects:+ The only Zorro adaptation+ Badass main character who reminds Kenshin+ Nice art direction+ Excellent character-designNEGATIVE aspects:- Inconsistent plotline- Incoherent characterization- Uneven animation value very webpage, need to be corrected. Kaiketsu Zorro is mainly a co-production between three countries: Toho Animation (Japan) / Mondo TV (Italy) / Royal Pictures Company (Switzerland). It\'s from a time when animation still was held in way good esteem outside of Japan\'s bounds. Nowadays, Mondo TV produces nothing and Royal Pictures Company limited went bankrupt in 2008 after 23 years of existence. While it benefited of international recognition, coming with substantial budget, this show isn\'t exactly of the calibre of a World Masterpiece Theater production. I\'ll explain you why with the following points.....| Story |.. 4/10The most critically flawed aspect. It\'s due to the lack of cohesion in direction. Indeed, storyline tend to loaf with filler episodes of relatively uninteresting workmanship (the ones where sergeant Gonzales/Garcia fall in love, this cheesetacular one where Zorro fences a shark...) to pick up suddenly the pace, as in the last arc where conclusion is rushed through regardless of its potential. It\'s like Toho or some other unindentified third party took over, upon realizing imminence of deadline, aware that this production is in need to show teeth to end at least half decently. Secondary intrigues often are disposed of, regardless of continuity. Thus, you can see Bernardo tie new friendships which aren\'t taken into account for the remainder of series.Format is at fault: independent episodes often gun down a franchise, if there\'s not a strong director to back them all under one flag. It\'s difficult to tell who was at the commands. Sometimes, it seems like the Japanese had a blast, making one tribute to Kaiju-eiga (if Toho isn\'t behind it, I don\'t know who is!!)... While in other instances, quite conventional angles transects these wild fits of fantasy as in an attempt to stick back with Johnston McCulley\'s spirit. In conclusion, due to how anime was produced, it\'s perpetually seated between two chairs. Does it want to be comedic with Boke/Tsukkomi routine? Does it want to be badass looking? Does it want to be oneiric? Plotline definitely lacks a common thread, so it falls short as one influence short circuits another...| Art |.. 8/10Takaya Hirotoshi\'s chara-design is rock solid. It\'s impossible to confuse one protagonist with another. For instance, Commandant Ramon has that subtle, handsome and yet silently ominous expression about him. Lieutenant Gabriel really looks like a smug douchebag with his top student air, while Don Alexandro has a austere and yet venerable look. The vast array of design is one top quality this series have.Art Direction is uneven. at times, sceneries are downright amazing!They have that Ghibli-like touch, as for the episode 19 with that mechanically redesigning house, The south India company headquarters or the docks full of Spanish gallions. A certain contrast strikes in when action pans over the dull town. Once again, At the reins of background art, two persons... Miyamae Mitsuharu, a veteran on this position, signs hands out best part. I doubt more about Giuliana Bertozzi\'s talent. She\'s certainly decent but her touch doesn\'t exactly show overall...| Animation |.. 6/10Whereas episode animation is fluid most of the time, quality critically slacks down at times, to the point of being shoddy. One example: the son of an assaulted landlord is chased as he\'s suspected in an assassination attempt. Upon escaping residence, the immediate soldier after him dashes... Like a drunkard. At one frames, he even inexplicably ends up in an axis way too outcentered of his course, on the right side. There happens to be a certain amount of continuity errors as well, when you focus attention on objects characters hold or background elements... I don\'t think key-animation is at fault. Only perhaps a couple of scatterbrained animators. Now, I know animation is dated, but there was noteworthy failures here and there explaining my low grade, as for the dance competition Lolita took on for her friend: staff was really off, expressing the sensuality of that performance above everything else...Indeed, these aren\'t unredeemable mistakes, but it\'s definitely sub-par with many other TV productions...| Sound |.. 6/10Fair.

It was a weekly basis episode for which we used to wait so restlessly that we didn't even liked to miss the intro music.I searched for it again and again on the internet but wasn't able to find it. But luckily just yesterday i found it on www.animeget.com website which is having this very rare...series. And i just started it watching it again just to refresh my childhood memories.As far as the story, plot and characters go,they are really good. The character Zorro is a true picture of a hero  that  saves the world.I gave it 10/ 10 rating just because when i watched it in childhood it really entertained.

If you watched it when you were a child or you like children's series in general, you will probably find it entertaining. If you're expecting a faithful Zorro adaptation or a mature story, you'll most likely be disappointed.First things first, the creators of this anime have taken some liberties with the characters and premise. The basics are the same - Diego de la Vega returns home to Spanish California because his father is worried about the state of things and the corruption of the army. Diego realises that he can't...fight the injustice openly, so he dons a mask and becomes an outlaw in order to stop the army from terrorizing the people. You will find a lot of the iconic Zorro elements in the series, such as a bumbling sergeant, a beautiful love interest who adores Zorro and sees Diego as a weakling, corrupt army officers and bandits and so on.So, what's different? First of all, Zorro gets a young sidekick who also wears a mask and a cape and provides a lot of the comic relief for the series. Almost every main character is blond for some reason. Zorro's horse is white instead of black. Diego has no moustache, and when he dresses up as Zorro, it's mostly in white with a black cape. The legendary image of Zorro in all black cannot be found anywhere in the series. If these changes don't bother you, you might enjoy the wacky adventures and humour that the series provides.CHARACTERSThe main cast consists of characters you'd expect to see in any version of Zorro, but they're a little different from usual. Most versions portray Diego's cover as a cultured intellectual who talks about philosophy and believes conflicts can be resolved through talking. Here, Diego is simply a loser. He spends his days napping in the sun and getting scolded and laughed at by all the other characters. This provides lots of funny scenes, but it can also be annoying. When he becomes Zorro, he's dashing and handsome and defeats his opponents in the blink of an eye, never forgetting to lecture them about justice.Zorro's sidekick is a young boy servant called Bernard who works for the de la Vegas. In most versions, he's deaf/mute and an adult, but here he's a normal kid, maybe so that the target audience has someone to identify with. There's really nothing special to say about him, except that if you think the idea of a little kid tagging along on Zorro's adventures together with a bulldog is annoying (the bulldog also gets a mask!), you may want to consider if you want to watch this. However, toward the end of the series Bernard gets to have a few serious scenes that really make him stand out as a character.The role of the love interest is played by Lolita, Diego's childhood friend who is openly disappointed by his laziness and cowardice. She's very opinionated and usually the first and only one among the citizens to object to the army's actions. Despite this, she has to be rescued on a regular basis because she keeps getting kidnapped and harassed in the streets whenever she goes out. Her constant nagging at Diego also gets tiring after a while, but there are enough scenes showing her good-hearted nature to make up for it.A lot of the comic relief comes from the incompetent but good-hearted sergeant who goes by the name Garcia or Gonzales, depending on which language you're watching the series in. He's more or less the same as in any other version, except that he gets to play the hero and be cool towards the end of the series.Finally, the villains. The main antagonist of the series is Commander Raymond who plots to overthrow the General-Governor and rule California himself. He's entirely ruthless and the only character in the series who never gets involved in the crazy nonsense that often engulfs the other characters. He mostly operates in the background and always manages to look good even when his plots fail, but those few times he decides to gets his hands dirty, he's a truly threatening figure.Most of Raymond's schemes are carried out by his right hand man, Lieutenant Gabriel. He's arrogant and without mercy, but he becomes more and more difficult to take seriously as the series progresses because he's the butt of so many jokes. Eventually, he more or less forms a comedy duo with Garcia. However, the last few episodes get him back on track. Episode 44 is also interesting since it revolves around him and shows just how rotten he is inside.PLOTThe series is very episodic and there isn't much of a story arc. A few side characters show up in several episodes, but other than that every episode is as if none of the previous events in the series had happened. The only significant event is the introduction of the corrupt British businessman Kapital as he shares the role of the main antagonist with Raymond for a while. However, episodes 47-52 pick up the plot, cut down on the humour and have continuity, which makes them among the best in the series.ANIMATIONThe animation varies greatly. Some episodes look horrible, but others are amazing and have such a Ghibli-style character design that I have to wonder just who animated them. Examples of such episodes are 31 and 51. Fighting scenes get recycled all through the series, but I guess that's nothing strange.MUSICThe opening and ending themes are great, but the music in the actual series is mostly forgettable and even boring.OVERALLIf you don't mind that the series takes lots of liberties with the source material, you might enjoy it. It's light-hearted adventure with comedy sprinkled all over it, and with a few exceptions (such as episode 34 and the very last episodes) it never gets particularly deep or mature. But it's very good at what it wants to be, so I don't think it would be fair to blame it for not being something it never tries to. fight the injustice openly, so he dons a mask and becomes an outlaw in order to stop the army from terrorizing the people.

Seeing him again has taken me to that happy childhood when after seeing the chapter of the day I played with my friends in the false door to the Fox. Seeing him with my friend has made me relive those wonderful days, although I still do not understand why in all the versions we have seen the Zorro is Latin-looking with his brown hair...and here is blond, but well still childhood is childhood and that is not changed. My favorite characters undoubtedly El Zorro and Lolita, the most hated ones are undoubtedly Ramón and Gabriel seem to me very despicable more than any other villain, but above all the worst is Gabriel, it is believed that it can have any woman at any price even going through kidnapping and blackmail, on top it calls itself a gentleman that is not gentlemen. Bernardo, in this version I think it’s a beauty, in addition to the fact that unlike in other versions it is not deaf and dumb, which is something new, it’s strange how the original character was created, But he’s charming, especially when he helps Zorro and here he has a pretty young girlfriend, he’s the one who reminded me of me when I was a little girl playing with my friends, I also disguised myself as the hero of the town. In addition, the Spanish dubbing is very well chosen too, in addition to the characters are both loved the good and hated the bad as it should be.  It also transmits that message of justice and values that the Fox always transmits, in addition to showing a great message of family and friendship.Decidedly, this is what they should put on TV along with other anime and drawings from our past instead of putting shows like SpongeBob or Dora the Explorer, which in my opinion created it so that the following generations did not think at all. The best series and anime or even movies are like this anime that show a great elaborate story that makes people feel and think, but above all that makes adults and children enjoy it. Children because it is a good entertainment and adults because it brings them back to that childhood that most of us left behind until we are ourselves parents. Because if I also think that if there is a good relationship between parents and children, they should share this type of series, because the stronger the bond with the family the better the children will feel and not all of us get that relationship with our parents and attending the manga events I could see how this type of bond is possible and the envy that gives me that my parents did not take me or they would share that taste with me at all.   Thank you so much for reading this is my opinion! and here is blond, but well still childhood is childhood and that is not changed.

Thank you so much for reading this is my opinion!', ""I grew up on this anime, i finished it at least 4 times but i could still rewatch it at any time.Since the main idea of the series is the fight for justice, it is perfect for small children because it teaches them to stand up against injustice. It also has a little romance-sideline so girls also can enjoy the story.But i wouldn't only recommend it for children. It's enjoyable for adults too, because of its historical reference and credible storylines.The episodes are mainly detached from eachother except for ep. 51 and ep. 52. The last two episodes are the dramatic peak of the...whole series.

Servamp Movie: Alice in the Garden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36803/Servamp_Movie__Alice_in_the_Garden,"['these movie is the sequel  of servamp . the movie show us the mystery of misono and mikuni . nothing is special here. if you wanna kill your time be free . but i suggest if you are not a fan of servamp just ignore it. i personally do not recommand it.The only positive thing I can say about it is the animation. It’s actually not that bad. The character designs were unique and each episode was often consistent. The action sequences weren’t terrible, but still a bit uninteresting. I did like it when the style changed like when a Servamp was using...its powers or we were inside their minds.Although it had some good ideas and animation, “Servamp” is still pretty boring with nothing to it. If I may be completely honest, the only thing that I truly got out of the show was the opening theme. It’s one of the styles of music that I love, but what got me was how unexpected it was. I had known beforehand that this was based on a shoujo manga, so this opening surprised the hell out of me. Knowing there are major differences in the manga, I may give that a shot someday. Otherwise, I don’t plan on revisiting the anime its powers or we were inside their minds.Although it had some good ideas and animation, “Servamp” is still pretty boring with nothing to it.

I would have liked to see more of Mikuni's character and growing up experience as well though.The story was alright, though not particularly very elaborate and the suspense was next to nothing. It was mostly about the things Lily, Misono's father and the servants were keeping from him (his whole past basically).

It may not be perfect, but it definitely deserves its lofty status in the history of anime as a proven classic. As one cannot have one part of the trilogy without the others, this review will cover all three of the compilation movies.The first question on any new viewer's mind regarding the story of Mobile Suit Gundam: the Movie Trilogy (MSG) would be: &quot;Do the films condense too much story from the TV series to fit into its limited run time?&quot; The answer to that is...&quot;no&quot;. MSG takes the liberty to cut some of the flab from the original series and manages very well in terms of preserving the integrity of the story. The pacing may strike as a little faster than usual, but there are no glaring problems pertaining to the question above.The story of MSG follows the crew of White Base, a secret earth federation battleship housing the RX-78-2 Gundam. The protagonist, Amuro Ray, makes the difficult transition from an ordinary civilian to the ace pilot of the federation military, along with a number of other civilians who were also pulled into the conflict against the Principality of Zeon when their space colony was destroyed by a Zeon attack, the purpose of which was to destroy the White Base, along with the experimental mobile suits being developed in secrecy. The long journey aboard the White Base exposes Amuro to many ugly facets of war far beyond the destruction of his home and the loss of life. In the midst of it all, Amuro is burdened with the responsibility of risking life and limb to protect his friends and comrades aboard the White Base, a target of constant Zeon attack, with the gundam. All this weaves an engrossing tale of struggle and growth, rife with challenges on and off the battlefield, making MSG a very interesting war story. There is an epic feel to the films, because though the adventure of the White Base stretches over many destinations, it is but a small part of the vast web of war and politics that makes up the interstellar conflict, and the characters' struggle for survival in the monstrous web makes them seem all the more vulnerable and the story that much more gripping.The characters of MSG are some of the most iconic in the history of anime. Amuro, as mentioned above, is a very well-developed character. His teenage angst may strike as a little too much in the beginning, but his clear maturation throughout the story makes him an endearing character. The antagonists of MSG also also equally memorable, as they are some of the best antagonists one will come across in anime: the cunning and skillful Char Aznable and Ramba Ral, the bold and courageous Dozle Zabi, and even the cold and calculated Ghiren Zabi -- all of them have plenty of admirable traits that really makes the viewer respect the nazi-inspired Zeon. Even when these antagonists bite the dust, the viewer would still feel for them.Hailing from the early 80's, MSG's visuals and sounds are quite aged. Though the animation has definitely improved from the sometimes laughable quality of the original TV series, it will not win over any new anime fans by itself. The frame rate is low, the proportion are sometimes warped, and the details are always shallow. Yet despite all this, MSG still manages to produce a number of memorable battle scenes, which is something to applaud for. The mecha designs, especially that of the gundam and zaku II, influenced mecha designs for decades to come. Even to this day, these old-school robots are sights to behold. The sound effects of MSG are almost as iconic as the mobile suits themselves. Fans will recognize the buzzing sound of the beam saber as well as blast of the beam rifle from miles away. Granted, the quality of these sound effects aren't anything amazing objectively, but they serve their functions well, and their nostalgia value is beyond measure. There are also a couple of very catchy battles tunes to be heard, as well as great sound acting, though Amuro's voice may be a little over-the-top at times.In the end, Mobile Suit Gundam: the Movie Trilogy should be a must-watch for anyone interested in mecha anime or the history of anime in general. Its influence, popularity, and historic value is simply through the roof. There is a reason why even almost three decades later, model kits of the old RX-78-2 are still selling like hotcakes and the name &quot;Char Aznable&quot; remains recognized almost everywhere in japan. MSG is the very definition of a classic, and this fact cannot be denied. What lies in question is the modern viewer's enjoyment of the aged classic. But with a stellar story and memorable characters, MSG still has the quality to win over its viewers, a quality that will most likely remain as long as there exists people who watch anime. &quot;no&quot;.

Going back to my first exposure to it, my 11 year-old self was rather indignant that this new ""Gundamn Wing"" show was going to be replacing my favorite cartoon Dragonball Z. I now know that my local network was simply attempting to introduce a new, more serious anime and using the DBZ timeslot was a perfect test-drive. And I was hooked. A serious story, political drama, and giant robots, what wasn\'t there to love? As I put more research into this strange new series, I learned of course that it was only a small...part of a much much larger franchise which consisted of alternate universes and of course, the Universal Century. Of course, I did watch other Gundam shows in between, namely SEED, SEED Destiny and 00. However, nearly all Gundam fans kept recommending me to go back to one series of shows I\'ve missed...Finding myself with plenty of free time and in need of much relaxation after a hard semester, my summer this year will consist of me watching every single UC series, OVA and movie (well, maybe except G-Savior) Beginning my arduous task was this movie, which was recommended to me over the TV series. I was expecting something a little more light-hearted during the opening minutes as I had watched the OP for the original series on Youtube (KIDOU SENSHIIII GUNDAMUUUUU) No, it was during those opening minutes that I realized the Universal Century was something entirely different from the alternate universes I was familiar with. It was a rather awkward situation for someone who was used to the slickly animated AU shows to be so disturbed by relatively crude images of colonies falling. Yoshiyuki Tomino\'s vision was simply uncompromising.A couple of very common criticisms of later Gundam shows are awkward characterization and slapdash plot, two criticisms which cannot be leveled at this movie. Amuro\'s characterization is rather realistic, showing plausible battle fatigue and interpersonal tension. From the get go, the viewer is drawn into the mysterious relationship between Char and Sayla. Captain Bright establishes a commanding presence on screen, just as he should. The great extent at which we sympathize with the characters and believe in them really lie on the shoulders of the seiyuus whose performances result in very believable overall characterization.As mentioned above, the plot cannot be criticized, mainly because there really isn\'t one. The movie is simply a series of battles, albeit entertaining ones. A situation is established, and the characters are thrown into it. Rinse, repeat. Glimmerings  of underlying story do shine through, namely Char\'s. The famous SIEG ZEON speech gives a good impression of the inner workings of the enemy who up until that point were simply cannon fodder.Visually, the movie shows all of the hallmarks of 70s anime, a bit of a negative. Bright, pastel colors punctuate every scene. Explosions are eye-assaulting fireworks shows. Uniforms resemble those of the super robot animes that Tomino fought so hard to differentiate from (this probably stems from executive meddling) Everyone wears ridiculous looking tights for some reason. However, it is because the designs are so eye-catching that they stick in the mind. Having 30 years to get to know their beloved characters, everyone in Japan will know who Amuro Ray, Sayla Mass or Kai Shiden is, what they look like, how they act. Even more iconic than the characters are the mecha. I remember first seeing the Zaku model kits, thinking ""what a weird design"" Placed within the context of the UC, they are excellent designs and do what they were intended to do: evoke totalitarian militarism. The titular mecha is by today\'s standards bare-bones, but it\'s presence on screen is always attention grabbing through it\'s actions and it\'s color scheme. To sum up, every character and mecha is distinctive.In conclusion, the first movie gave me an incredible first impression. Hitting hard in the opening minutes, the movie carries action and character development consistently all the way through. Though marred by some questionable art choices, this is overshadowed by how distinctive each and every design is. A great way to start, but I just wished there was more of a plot. part of a much much larger franchise which consisted of alternate universes and of course, the Universal Century.

I couldn\'t distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys but then innocents got killed so yeah. The story started slowly with a little display of conflicts, nothing wrong here. The problem is that it kept dragging on till the first hour and a half. I got sleepy there and had to take a break. However the ""second part"" got a lot better because the actions made more sense and some characters got development.A mix of good and bad so 5.Art: The art part was good for such an old movie, the chara design was great,...no look-alike. That\'s a plus for me. However some scenes were weirdly drawn like one where Amuro puts a sad face but the way I see it, it looked like he was high on mushrooms with eyes gone white and staring at the wall like a broken robot. Not much to be considered a flaw but had to be noticed.Good old stuff: 8.Sound: The film had good music and the ending was great too. The main theme is a plus (the dvd menu theme). I give it a 8.Character: Some guy need some development (Char: good introduction as the Akai Suisei but then fall into oblivion). Maybe I\'m asking too much with just the first movie but then I\'ll see how it goes. The same goes for Sayla Mass. She seems like a strong female lead character but the only thing I know about her is that she hates cowardice. The main character Amuro is getting more interesting as he has some inner conflicts with war stuff but there\'s a chance he just turns out to be an ace pilot who\'s good at saying ""Yes Sir!"". A 6 for now might get better for the second movie.Enjoyment: I couldn\'t watch this movie as a whole so no plus here. A 4 because it wasn\'t shitty yet nothing amazing. no look-alike. That\'s a plus for me.

Back then I wanted to learn more about the history of anime and Mobile Suit Gundam is definitely one of those foundations the expanded anime to the western world. Before Pokémon came along, the craze was all about Mobile Suit Gundam toys and games in the 80s.Although the series hasn’t aged well, the trilogy movies is a slight improvement from the original series.It is easy to digest and the series doesn’t feel too dragged...out as the original. Art work is fairly decent and the diologue in English dub is really nice. For some reason when I watched the series it takes me to the decades of the 80s, in a way you can learn a bit about the lifestyle of people during the 80sThis first film covers the events of Amuro Ray’s first flight into the Gundam all the way up to the fight with Garmna Zabi.Definitely the trilogy movies is a good option if you don’t want to watch it’s longer version. out as the original.

It's one of my favorite things, UC Gundam especially. The Original movie trilogy is my typical go-to if someone wants to experience the original story, as 40+ episodes can be pretty daunting to someone who is interested in Gundam but not yet ride-or-die, y'know? But, I always lay it out like this-The first movie is kind of a tough watch in lots of places.The second movie gets it's shit together in the right places, and is pretty dang enjoyable!I have requested in my will that I am buried with a copy of...the third movie.This movie is a tough watch- it's pacing is odd, as it tries to capture as much as it can in a short amount of time. That's just the nature of a compilation, I can't fault it too hard! I doubt I could do it better, in fact! But, in my opinion, this movie is slow going, but with the two that come after it, I'd recommend powering through! Hey, you might even end up liking it a lot more than me! :D the third movie.This movie is a tough watch- it's pacing is odd, as it tries to capture as much as it can in a short amount of time.

However, with such a large ensemble cast, the story doesn't focus so much on Amuro like it should. The beginning jumps around a lot and around the halfway mark is it clear that the main arc we're following is Amuro's transformation from geeky teenager to self-sufficient soldier. It was annoying, because once I realized this I was wishing for more time to be spent with it.I really enjoy the gray area nature of the narrative. Both the Federation and the Zeon have a cast of characters that are only fighting...because they're aligned to different factions, not because they are inherently evil. That said, we do see on both sides the evidence of hatred and evils within the factions. It's a nice addition to something that could have easily been a white and black conflict. It means there will not only be combat within the story to come, but politics that come into play where we as viewers may sympathize with the opposition during an event.All that said, nothing particularly special takes place outside of Amuro's evolution. War is war, but character development makes war a story. If we'd seen something similar with other characters (which we get a tease of with Garma) then my rating for Story would have been above a 7.Art:I can't say whether there had been better animated works during the year this released, but I can say that certain scenes in this film are better animated than others. I find this to be incredibly lazy, and it's only made worse when some scenes are re-used. Not only that, it uses some classic animated gimmicks that thankfully have not been used in ages (outside of references or satire). There's a reason we don't see triangular profiles of speaking characters anymore.Sound:Really enjoyed the sound effects. I thought they sounded really cool and always enjoyed hearing the ships take off or Gundam in combat. This may be my favorite part about the film, in all honesty. The sounds are solid.Soundtrack was okay. It's nothing special. It feels like it was made real cheap and with no inspiration what-so-ever. A real shame, as some songs sounded good, but as they went on I felt like I was lied to.Character:Designs are neat. I always liked realistic character designs. Outside of Char's goofy outfit, nothing to really note here.Personality wise, I felt as though Amuro's character was strange and kinda bipolar. Perhaps it's because of the run-time (although it's a WHOPPING 2 hours and 20 minutes) but after each fight, he enters a new stage of emotional reaction that seems too swift to appear and too swift to resolve. Honestly, it's kind of stupid. This, again, is the fault of the ensemble cast that must also be attended too, despite the story trying to put an emphasis on Amuro.Enjoyment:Yeah, I had a good time. The run-time was the biggest problem. It's long, and the film doesn't particularly have much to offer during its length, and I refuse to pause a movie and come back to it (despite the fact I left 15 minutes into the film to go shopping before it was too late)((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!)) because they're aligned to different factions, not because they are inherently evil.

Half of the time, Wing and Iron-Blooded Orphans, it\'s been good. The other half, 00 and 8th MS Team, has been mediocre to sub-par. This time, we\'re going back to the beginning. To be specific, we\'re watching the first recap film based off the original series.Story:Our narrative is set in the distant future when humans have formed various colonies in space to handle our growing population. In this climate the Zeon colony declares itself independent from the Earth federation and they go to war. We open in the Side 7 colony where...Federation troops are delivering a new mobile suit weapon and Zeon forces attack.The biggest problem with the narrative is that it\'s all kind of formulaic. And I\'m not just talking about the Gundam specific tropes that started with this series. In general, it just uses a lot of very obvious flags and old sci-fi tropes. Like, there\'s a point where a character is about to go into battle and you know just from thirty seconds of build up that he won\'t survive. The death flag is just really obvious. We\'re talking a senior cop two days from retirement obvious. Which makes things more than a little uninteresting since you can always predict what\'s coming. Another issue is that the film tries to present this balanced perspective where the Zeon aren\'t all bad but then they have a Nazi style speech and salute towards the end of the film which pretty much destroys any moral grey area. I mean, the moment any side is reminiscent of Nazis, they\'re the bad guys. Just objectively.On the positive side, this series does do a good job of explaining why young teenagers are the best choice for piloting these destructive weapons into battle. It\'s a simple explanation of ""most adults have already been killed in the war"" but it works.Characters:The big problem with the characters in this is that they\'re very bland. one of them have much complexity or development. About the most we get for that is our protagonist, Amuro, sulking in his tent like Achilles because he feels overwhelmed and that ends up boiling down to three minutes of ""I can\'t go back out there and kill more people"" followed by ""guess I have no choice."" So, it ends up coming across as him being an easily malleable tool. Another issue I have with Amuro is his relationship with his parents. His dad disappears during his first battle and he barely says anything about it after. And his mom, who he hasn\'t seen in like ten years, gets mad at him for changing in that time and for killing someone in self defence. Which just lacks verisimilitude.The only character with some potential at the end of the first film is Char. His story arc is kind of obvious. He has some vendetta against the family at the top of the Zeon empire and he\'s infiltrated them for the sake of his revenge. But I do think if that gets properly developed it can be really interesting. Other than that, the cast is boring.Art:The artwork is dated. It uses a lot of those old school animation tricks to save on frames. Reusing cells, blurred motion lines, segments where characters basically stand completely still and the only animation is some mouth movements. It also doesn\'t have designs that are as good as the subsequent instalments of the franchise. Which is understandable since this was laying out the groundwork but it also contributes to the whole thing looking dated.Sound:The acting is fine. Furuya Toru, Ikeda Shuuichi, Inoue You, Ukai Rumiko and the others all sound fine. It\'s just one of those series where the acting is limited by the lack of character complexity. The music is pretty good.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any to be found.Areas of Improvement:1. If you want to have a conflict that\'s morally grey, you can\'t have one side be reminiscent of Nazis. It\'s a good thing to have sympathetic antagonists, but once they start talking about being the superior race and doing Sieg Heils, sorry Sieg Zeons, they\'re never going to be sympathetic. No matter how much you talk about them having families and fighting for their freedom.2. Develop your main cast. The protagonists in this are all just bland. And it does hurt the film that Amuro is such an unevenly written character.3. Use some subversion. Yes, there are times when writers should play their tropes straight. But when they do it with everything, you end up with a narrative that\'s far too obvious and predictable.Final Thoughts:As a start to a film trilogy, this is pretty dull. So far, the narrative is predictable, the characters have nothing to them, the artwork shows its age. Overall, I give it a 5/10. Maybe the other two films are better. I will look at them eventually. Not a great start though. Federation troops are delivering a new mobile suit weapon and Zeon forces attack.The biggest problem with the narrative is that it\'s all kind of formulaic.

Which just lacks verisimilitude.The only character with some potential at the end of the first film is Char. His story arc is kind of obvious. He has some vendetta against the family at the top of the Zeon empire and he\'s infiltrated them for the sake of his revenge. But I do think if that gets properly developed it can be really interesting. Other than that, the cast is boring.Art:The artwork is dated. It uses a lot of those old school animation tricks to save on frames. Reusing cells, blurred motion lines, segments where characters basically stand completely still and the only animation is some mouth movements. It also doesn\'t have designs that are as good as the subsequent instalments of the franchise. Which is understandable since this was laying out the groundwork but it also contributes to the whole thing looking dated.Sound:The acting is fine. Furuya Toru, Ikeda Shuuichi, Inoue You, Ukai Rumiko and the others all sound fine. It\'s just one of those series where the acting is limited by the lack of character complexity. The music is pretty good.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any to be found.Areas of Improvement:1. If you want to have a conflict that\'s morally grey, you can\'t have one side be reminiscent of Nazis. It\'s a good thing to have sympathetic antagonists, but once they start talking about being the superior race and doing Sieg Heils, sorry Sieg Zeons, they\'re never going to be sympathetic. No matter how much you talk about them having families and fighting for their freedom.2. Develop your main cast. The protagonists in this are all just bland. And it does hurt the film that Amuro is such an unevenly written character.3. Use some subversion. Yes, there are times when writers should play their tropes straight. But when they do it with everything, you end up with a narrative that\'s far too obvious and predictable.Final Thoughts:As a start to a film trilogy, this is pretty dull. So far, the narrative is predictable, the characters have nothing to them, the artwork shows its age. Overall, I give it a 5/10. Maybe the other two films are better. I will look at them eventually. Not a great start though.', 'Engaging from beginning to end and holds up like a gem.

This can very safely be watched in the place of the series, but you do trade some scenes for better overall animation quality. The first film covers the events of Amuro Ray's first flight in the Gundam all the way up to the fight with Garma Zabi.The animation is passable, improving on the original in terms of avoiding stock animation (mostly) but still keeping the charm of the original's very saturated colours, large, blocky mobile suit designs and cute...characters. I do prefer this approach to redoing the original, and I would say this means that the film generally gives the same experience as the series.The films are edited a bit strangely, with very harsh cuts at times that don't give you much time to process what is happening. For example, in the early scenes a hole is blown in a colony and Amuro's father just gets sucked out into space, which happens insanely quickly and is barely brought up later. Characters die, jump between battle and being onboard, in and out of mobile suits and all around white base with very little warning from the score or dialogue. I have decided to optimistically take this as a way of showing how war does not allow people to take proper time to grieve or something, just make sure to not look away from the screen too long or you'll find yourself missing the whole battle.Mobile Suit Gundam's greatest suit (lol) is by far its characters. Char particularly is THE character for most of MSG, and I am always glued to his presence and the incredible VA work. Amuro is a very interesting protagonist, subverting the expectation of a wide-eyed kid who wants to give his life in a cool robot to fight for justice, instead he is far more aware and sensitive, the first flight in the Gundam ends with him being visibly disturbed at his capability to kill. Amuro is often insubordinate to anyone he can be to, particularly Bright, the 19 year old captain of the white base who by far is the most relatable character, embodying the complaints of the viewer at Amuro and the other (child) soldiers aboard the white base by beating respect into them often.The mobile suits are just cool. I like the Zaku II. Nothing more needs to be said without being unoriginal, big robots are cool and I very willingly assembled many gunpla after watching this film.

I haven’t seen the series, but these films managed to be much more coherent than I had expected, considering they had to condense something like 20 hours of footage into about 7. Even more surprising is that at least two of them - the first and last - manage to be totally functionable movies in their own right, both of them featuring something like a distinct beginning, middle, and end rather than the general homogeneous ‘this thing happened then that thing happened’ that can easily emerge from turning a tv series into a film. This makes...sense, because the first film couldn’t have not had a beginning nor could the last not have had an end, but beyond this both these films also display a clear conceptual movement across their runtime. The first film starts in something approximating peace and quiet and moves into the exploration and exposure of the horrific effects of the war (Amuro's mother telling him, upon their first encounter in over 10 years, that the war has made him a killer, standing out in particular from the last third); the second in the standard intensity of war that has been established thus far and ramping it up to critical intensities - weapons of mass destruction, senseless slaughter, patricide, fratricide (it is worth noting the film has no epilogue, we end right on the post-climax apprehension of the destructive consequences of the climactic battle. The period afterwards, of trying to pack the horror up and establish again a veneer of normality, the film does not concern itself with at all).  The second film lacks any movement like this, and, at a not-even-that-high resolution, any point in it is much like any other. The result is something that, rather than something capable of standing on its own, feels very much like watching 15 episodes from the middle part of a tv show.One of things Gundam made very clear to me is that Evangelion is excellent and remarkable for reasons other than the one that is often given - that it “subverts” its genre by taking seriously both the characters emotions and the traumas that would inevitably result from the events they’re forced to bear. That feature is in fact absolutely core to the ‘real robot’ genre itself, and it's right here at its genesis with these movies and the series. Evangelion even seems to be in direct communication with in Gundam at many points regarding which parts of this conceptual space it explores; compare the opening 15 minutes of both and you’ll see multiple points where Evangelion seems to have positioned itself as a complete inverse of Gundam - the relationship between the father, the protagonist, and the conflict being one particularly obvious example. In the few psychedelic sequences that pop up in the last film, Gundam even has something of the supremely confident weirdness that elevates Eva to the level of masterpiece, although admittedly to a much much lesser extent.Other than this somewhat-lacking element of confident weirdness (which I really is necessary for the peaks of artistic greatness), the only other real weakness of the film is how much development of secondary characters that was presumably in the series had to be cut. You can really feel this in the third film, as characters who have spoken as little as 3 lines die or suffer in weighty moments. It’s testament to the success of the film that these moments still feel reasonably significant, even when you can barely remember the names of the characters involved.Taken as a whole then, the trilogy is mostly very good and interesting, with a slight dip across the middle. Probably a must-watch for anyone who even vaguely thought Eva was good. Also - make sure to watch till the epigraph after the last film's credits.

It\'s lacking in the striking visuals of something like Eva, which comes out much later, but nonetheless remains a visually pleasing piece of work for its time; it sort of has a ""rustic charm"" to it.The real star of the film is the characterisation of Amuro and his struggle with PTSD, which grows over the course of the film to excellent pacing, until he\'s incapable of sleeping or eating almost entirely, barely being animated for anything but the Gundam he pilots. It completely does away with the cultural...idea that all mecha anime pre-Eva was lacking in any sort of psychological conflict or focus; the image of war is vivid: it\'s not just Amuro who gets subsumed by the pointless and eternal war, but all of his friends and neighbours, who quickly assume their roles in the military as if it were second nature.Certainly, the writing is good, excellent, even: Amuro\'s portrayal of PTSD, and the war he\'s fighting in, feel grim and real, often lacking in some of the theatrics and eccentricities that come with a lot of anime, but if one thing can be said, it\'s that the film likes to announce ""this is war"" just a little too much. idea that all mecha anime pre-Eva was lacking in any sort of psychological conflict or focus; the image of war is vivid: it\'s not just Amuro who gets subsumed by the pointless and eternal war, but all of his friends and neighbours, who quickly assume their roles in the military as if it were second nature.Certainly, the writing is good, excellent, even: Amuro\'s portrayal of PTSD, and the war he\'s fighting in, feel grim and real, often lacking in some of the theatrics and eccentricities that come with a lot of anime, but if one thing can be said, it\'s that the film likes to announce ""this is war"" just a little too much.', ""A solid film that develops the narrative of the original Gundam universe.

Imagine this coming out and seeing such a profoundly different style of the show, especially with how different politically the world was back then with what was appropriate and what was not.The movie 1 of 3 culminations covering a series to a certain point brings home some pretty old ideas, age roles and gender roles.

One thing I really love especially later in the series is how they connect and how some characters here have children eventually that are involved in later movies and series. Not a spoiler just a fun fact. Amuro Ray the main character twinned as one with Char Aznable.

The voice acting is a little awkward sometimes (in the subbed version) and evcen the vintage animation can feel odd during certain scenes, but this movie has an undeniable charm. I really wonder what happened to Amuro's dad. Is that a plot hole, or will it be resolved in the following film?One thing I notice is that there doesn't seem to be too much depth or development in many of the characters. You don't really care that Amuro's mom is ashamed of his actions,...and it doesn't bother you too much that Amuro is tired and crying from not wanting to pilot the Gundam. If you are specifically looking strong character development, you might be disappointed with watching this, but if you're just wanting an old school piece of anime history that's aesthetically pleasing, Mobile Suit Gundam I is pretty good.

This first short begins by showing us Bob, looking desolate, inside a dark, colorless train. A child, approaching, offers him a red flower, to which he shakes his head, denying it. Here there is already, semiotically, something said. According to websites about the meaning of flowers, ""red flowers are associated with love. Receiving a red flower means that you are loved"" and, if we assume that this flower is a rose, we could also say that ""the rose is the flower of greatest symbolism in Western culture. The Rose is a flower consecrated to many goddesses in mythology. Symbol of Aphrodite and Venus (Greek and Roman goddess of love). Christianity adopted the Rose as the symbol of Mary"", that is, the child, in her purity, offers her the purest love, which can also be the grace of life, and Bob denies it, for reasons that will be shown to us in the future.

A buffalo-drawn carriage, driven by an old man, stops in front of him and invites him to board. Inside, he soon finds an open piano, which takes him back to his past, which will be dealt with in the future, and closes it, as if to keep the memory of the trauma locked away and hidden. As he puts his hand under the falling rain, however, he faces his fingers, and a melody played on the piano begins to play. When she returns her hand to her knee, she is already fingering an imaginary piano, unraveling the memory that she wanted to keep hidden. Now Bob brings a melancholic look, as if turned inward. When he arrives at the next station, the same child who had offered him the flower boards the wagon. Along the way, the child opens the closed piano and plucks disordered notes from it. This sight is enough to make Bob\'s memory come alive, and it is then that we see what is probably his daughter, in the past, playing, on the piano, the same melody from memory, while being watched by him. And it is then that we see the cause of his reluctance to accept another\'s love and of his drive to keep the trigger for his past locked away: the death of his daughter. As he sails her body away, the piano in the room and the girl herself undergo a fade out and disappear, of them only the longing in Bob remains. Back on the wagon, he is now looking into the distance, as if absorbed in his thoughts; the child continues to play until he falls asleep, it is dark. Bob, his eyes glowing (holy detail, Tomoyasu!), faces the open piano once again, takes off his hat and brings it to his chest, closing his eyes. This, besides being a common sign of respect, may also be the beginning of a prayer, an attempt to find the grace he has denied the child. Decided, he then takes a seat and begins to play the piano, accepting the opportunity granted by the innocent purity of that child. Then he faces his open palms once more, and, with the child\'s hands over his right, closes his left over them, a gesture that is the final acceptance of the love offered by that child through the rose. Waking up, amazed, from this dreamlike adventure, Bob finds himself on the train again, but now the color saturation of the image and its luminosity are much greater than before, as if the world then seems more alive and warm to him. When he opens his hands, there is the rose, symbol of the acceptance previously mentioned. On that road, on that path that symbolizes the passage of life, Bob was first alone and stopped in the middle of the desert, but the presence of another person willing to give him back the grace took him out of this state, put him back on the road, and he now goes on, as the train goes on, looking for new meaning in life after the acceptance phase of mourning.White RoadI would say that Scarlet is already a complete work in itself, but Murata has much more to comment on about Bob\'s life.The symbolism of the color white: purity and innocence, concepts also related to childhood. In this second short film, we see him visiting the place where he spent the first stages of his life, as if to remember his whole life in search of finding himself again after the events of the train. His first memory is of him, together with a little girl, collecting acorns in the forest. The hand twisting on her blouse, a nervous gesture, already creates the idea of her affection for little Bob, which is reinforced by her gaze to the sky, as if fantasizing in a daydream. In the middle of the trees, they find another key element of this past, a puppy dog adopted by Bob. The affection he has for the animal is well evidenced by the time he spends lying next to it, and by his reluctance, shown by the look back that Bob has on leaving the dog alone in its separate room in the house. And it is then that two losses occur in sequence for him. One night, a blizzard starts, knocks down the window of the room, killing the dog with cold and covering the area in white, which is followed by the departure of the girl\'s family, her included, to another region, which we know is far away by the emphasis given in the girl\'s gesture of farewell. Interesting to note: when Bob, an adult, arrives at the place, it is still covered in snow, as if ""nothing has changed"", but in a psychological aspect: these two first traumas, related to loss and separation, have become strong enough memories in Bob for the whole place to remain as if stopped in time, always snowed, which reinforces the idea previously mentioned that this trip back to the place is made with the intention of changing this paradigm, of finding the good parts of his childhood. And rightly so, the next scene features Bob walking along a white path towards the old house, while his younger version runs past him, visually symbolizing this meeting of the past self. Nevertheless, the first thing Bob looks at outside the house is his old swing, a probable childhood companion. When he enters the house, he walks through the rooms not only looking at them, but also touching the furniture, in an attempt to relive each memory of that place through synesthetic stimuli. When he falls asleep lying on the floor, we see, as if in spirit, the older version of the dog (which should be his current form if he had survived) staring at his former owner. As if sensing the presence, Bob wakes up, and the first thing he sees, behind the door through which the dog has left, is a red flower. Bearing in mind the aforementioned about the symbolism of this plant, we can infer that at that moment Bob obtained the puppy\'s forgiveness and love, gaining from him the grace of life as he had gained from that child. Leaving there, he makes his way to the small village cemetery, where he faces the memory of his last and desperate efforts in trying to warm the already dead dog. The dog, in spirit beside him, seems to show him that, by his intentions and feelings, he is free of the guilt he carried for the animal\'s death. Arriving, finally, at the place where he said goodbye to the girl, he sees the puppy in the same position as when he left, a clever way of the work to say that, as in her case, he will now have to deal with the definitive separation with him, which is reinforced by the passage of the bus. Facing the dark sky now, he holds in his hands the last remaining item from the girl\'s memory: the acorn they picked up the same day the puppy was adopted. In the last shot, we see the dog in the snow staring at a red flower, which I think is the final representation of what this stage of Michi had as a goal: Bob\'s attainment of the grace or meaning of life through the memory of his childhood and the elements in it. Doing a little research, I have found that it is well accepted in psychoanalytic theory to treat a patient\'s trauma by the forgiveness given to his past, a past brought to light through hypnosis, and forgiveness granted by the individual himself to his former self. Whether this is the parallel that Tomoyasu brings in this short film I cannot know, but I doubt it is just a coincidence, especially when we think about the visual presence of the dog, which is analogous to the experience of the patient under hypnosis.Indigo RoadEven though Bob has reconciled with his childhood, he has not yet overcome his most recent losses. The color blue, in more contemporary symbolism, carries with it mainly sadness and despair. Not by chance, the term ""feeling blue"" means, in English, to be sad. However, indigo, in specific, transmits ""A better understanding of life situations. As such, the color is excellent for people who cultivate negative thoughts and obsessions of any aspect, since it cancels out these behaviors."" Of the 5 states of grief, this stage is the fourth, depression, while the last short one will be the acceptance stage.At the beginning, we see Bob awakening from his sleep in the open in the middle of an empty city, with a broom by his side. In the next scene, a woman arranges sheet music lying haphazardly in front of a piano. From then on, the narrative consists of interspersing this woman\'s domestic activities with Bob\'s visits to different abandoned buildings. Jumping to the final sequences, Bob enters the same room where we saw the woman, and it is from this point that we can interpret the passages I have ignored. Finding the room in a darker and dirtier version than previously shown to us, he bursts into tears, and from this, coupled with his visual search for recognizable traces, we can infer that not only was this his former home, but the woman shown was his companion, probable wife (given that Bob had a daughter), who also left. With this revelation, saved for the ending with cathartic intentions, in mind, every previous scene, which I have so far ignored, takes on new meaning. In the past, we can see a red flower in the window being visited by a butterfly; in the present, we see not only the dead butterfly being swept away by Bob, but the flower also withered and dead. Given the aforementioned symbolism of the flower, and taking the butterfly as a symbol of ""happiness, beauty, inconstancy, ephemerality of nature and renewal,"" the death of the two in the present signifies precisely the lack of life, of grace, of the passage of time, that is, an eternal melancholy monotony in which the protagonist finds himself. In the past, the woman took care of Bob even when he was not present, as we can see by the organization and cleaning of the house, by the preparation of meals and the dinner table, by the assiduousness with which she arranged everything for when he returned from his job (which, by the way, was that of a pianist in an establishment, given the presence of a grand piano in the already abandoned place visited by Bob in the present time). The loss of her is for Bob the loss of a constantly received affection, of a reason why he returned home happy every day, of a safe haven in the midst of difficulties. When Bob sweeps a hallway, it is in memory of her. When he sees himself in the past cleaning the bathroom, it is in memory of the time he spent alone in that house after the loss. When, following the same path as his past self, he interrupts his walk to look at himself in the mirror, it is to contemplate his present self, finishing the three phases from happy memory to sad memory, and from sad memory to the empty present. Conscious now of the present, he finally goes towards the room in which he spent his conjugal life. His last illusion is of the woman coming to meet him to open the door at the same moment he turns the knob and opens it by himself. A black screen, a sudden interruption in the music. Disappointment and emotional shock come at the same time. When the colors return, from all the windows emanates indigo, whose meaning I have already mentioned. The interior, in contrast to the past, is decrepit and in disorder. It is precisely at this point that we see the withered red flower, whose meaning I have already explained. With the dishes of his last meal still together and haunting him, Bob falls asleep on his bed, bathed in the blue light that brings with it the cruel reality.Lemon Road""The taste of lemon makes it a reference to the feeling of bitterness and disappointment. For the Hebrews, however, this fruit is the symbol of the heart."" As stated earlier, the latter short is the acceptance of the bitter reality left over after disillusionment, and the attempt to create a heart, in the metaphorical sense, for oneself within it.Most of it is made up of sequences that show Bob\'s routine life after the events of the other three. With the change of weather marking the passage of time, we see Bob coming and going, several times on different days, from a public library. Although there are now people around him, he is still reluctant to accept new contact, preventing another party from dialoguing with him through the use of headphones. A woman, sitting at the same table inside the enclosure, looks at him with interest, a detail that will be important for the conclusion.  As we see him, at first, returning two books and already taking out a new one, we deduce that he has become an assiduous reader, trying to fill his life with literature; the clock, twice framed, shows the great amount of time Bob spends in the place. On one of these visits he finds, inside a book of his interest, a paper note, containing a telephone number. The sound of footsteps heard in the background added to the emptiness of the library gives us a hint that one of the regulars there has left him, probably being the woman who had looked at Bob earlier. At home, he refuses to call, for there is still in him a reluctance to start a new life, both out of fear of another loss and because he has not gotten from his ex-wife what he got from his dog; there has not yet been a schism between the Bob of that stage and this one. At a certain point, since there has been no connection on his part, the other party starts calling, giving him the maximum opportunity, but he still ignores it.And it is then that the dream comes to change this situation. Inside, Bob is in a room, in which there is a telephone and a window. The telephone rings, clamoring to be answered. But just as Bob is gathering the courage to cross the line, the object is pulled out of the window by the cord. Looking through it, our protagonist sees a summary of his fears and traumas: all the things and people around him being swallowed up into nothingness, a visual metaphor for the losses he has suffered, leaving only him, alone, static and inactive as the days and nights go by. The fear that this will happen again is what keeps Bob isolated, refusing to interact and meet new people, lest new happiness become new pain.Looking into the room again, he sees a huge lemon beside him. And the lemon, what could it be? As I mentioned in the introduction to this section, the heart, but a heart full of the bitterness and sourness of life; Bob\'s own sentimental core. And it is then that this heart, with an effort that was only made possible by the forgiveness and flowers received in the first two short films, prints him the note from the telephone, which he had in hand. Accepting the open space in his heart, Bob takes his pass to a new life, and wakes up from the dream.The next morning, he goes to the phone booth and calls the number on the paper, but is not answered, and the call drops. A final defeat after the last momentum? But suddenly the music becomes more cheerful and energetic, the sky takes on a vivid color, and the atmosphere is bathed in sunshine. The paper, left in the cabin, has its numbers erased, and becomes a butterfly, symbolizing that, even though this chance was only a failed attempt (and that is why the writing is gone), Bob\'s acceptance to say goodbye to the past and try new possibilities to be happy with other people and environments around him gives him a new lease on life, gives him the rebirth, already mentioned as one of the meanings of the butterfly, the hope to be happy. And for this reason, the last scene of the play shows us Bob, drinking coffee in a brightly lit place, surrounded by red flowers, of love and the grace of life, even though for the time being he is alone. For, without the blockage of his past, the chances to be happy are in all places and people, and a new meaning to his life can be longed for and sought after. As long as he decides to face the world and risk being betrayed, hurt, and losing everything again, he can rebuild everything he once had, and if the worst happens, he will have the strength to overcome it again, as he has done before.If in Indigo the butterflies and flowers were dead and withered, now they fill the environment! protagonist as Bob (hail, Sshuraa). This first short begins by showing us Bob, looking desolate, inside a dark, colorless train. A child, approaching, offers him a red flower, to which he shakes his head, denying it. Here there is already, semiotically, something said. According to websites about the meaning of flowers, ""red flowers are associated with love. Receiving a red flower means that you are loved"" and, if we assume that this flower is a rose, we could also say that ""the rose is the flower of greatest symbolism in Western culture. The Rose is a flower consecrated to many goddesses in mythology. Symbol of Aphrodite and Venus (Greek and Roman goddess of love). Christianity adopted the Rose as the symbol of Mary"", that is, the child, in her purity, offers her the purest love, which can also be the grace of life, and Bob denies it, for reasons that will be shown to us in the future. The train then jerks, and the main character wakes up. When he opens his eyes, he is surprised to find himself in a station in the middle of a deserted place. A buffalo-drawn carriage, driven by an old man, stops in front of him and invites him to board. Inside, he soon finds an open piano, which takes him back to his past, which will be dealt with in the future, and closes it, as if to keep the memory of the trauma locked away and hidden. As he puts his hand under the falling rain, however, he faces his fingers, and a melody played on the piano begins to play.

Some are simple enough you can make them at home.10/10 Desire of viewer to cook or buy dishes featured after watching show - Will motivate you to cook if you have the ingredients available, especially for the simple, accessible dishes like Watermelon Pizza.Overall 8/10It\'s a grand gourmet anime that has 100% focus on preparing, cooking and eating the food during the Chinese New Year Spring festival period.

Masamune-kun no Revenge R,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51498/Masamune-kun_no_Revenge_R,"[""The anime had a very promising start in terms of romance, but also a bit strange with the introduction of a caricatured, flashy character, surrounded by unlikely things. That said, it didn't focus much on this secondary story about the Frenchwoman Muriel and at one point left this plot completely aside. Another positive point of this beginning is that it made rapid progress in overcoming the Kanetsugu problem, resolving it in a very satisfactory way. Kanetsugu had been introduced at the end of the previous season, being hated by the public, and causing damage to the experience of almost everyone who only watched the first...season.Generally, I have no problems with works divided into seasons, but not in this case. The anime presents significant changes in the perception of several events that were being developed in the first season, since they were not yet finalized. Some things that seemed bad in the first season turn out to be great in the second. In this aspect, Kanetsugu's arc was particularly affected, since the seasons divided him in half. In addition to this arc, the perception that the anime conveyed about Yoshino and Aki is completely changed as a result of major revelations and excellent new arcs. Therefore, it is likely that the rating for the first season would be much higher if everyone who voted had seen the entire second season before voting.Without a doubt, it is one of the best animes of the 2023 summer season and, without a doubt, one of the best romance animes of recent years. With a difference that there was no need to overuse sexual appeals to be a captivating work. Much of this is due to the fact that in terms of the story it is always progressing a lot, presenting a great rhythm, giving closure, bringing twists and turns and various surprises. Furthermore, it is capable of awakening emotions and winning over with quality content. Finally, it is extremely gratifying to see the author's care in relation to all the elements so that they can fit together in a precise and surprising way later in the work. Although it is not an uncriticable work, it is imperative to recognize the merits of the author's excellent writing work.After due acknowledgment and clear recommendation, it is necessary to mention some problematic points, but which do not significantly interfere with the satisfactory experience. The Frenchwoman is a character with some relevant moments, therefore, she could not be completely erased from the plot, but overall she is a character that remains a lot, giving the impression of being just a filler made by the original work. The worst thing is that even though it seems like they tried not to develop the character so much in the anime, they highlighted and developed her enough so that she shouldn't be forgotten like the plot does. They created an unnecessary dilemma, where they understood that focusing more on what is left is bad. Therefore, they chose to leave an arc without an ending, as it seemed to be the least bad. In my opinion, they should have given even less focus to this character from the beginning, as reducing her participation would not leave the impression of something unfinished.The other point that could be improved is that, at times, the anime exaggerates too much to produce humor and not only does it not work but it ends up not having adherence to the work. In this aspect, what stands out most is the protagonist's mother, a short girl who behaves and looks like a little child.My final recommendation is for anyone who saw the first season a long time ago to please review it before watching this second, as you will certainly see the beauty of this work more clearly. season.Generally, I have no problems with works divided into seasons, but not in this case.

""Masamune-kun no Revenge R"".Okay, again! ""Masamune-kun no Revenge R"". Again! ""Masamune-kun no Revenge R"". GoodIn this review, surely contains spolier but I can tell you it won\'t waste your time. So I will try my best to keep it short. The storyline of this anime where season 1 left us in the middle of ocean where we are in urge to see how this main protagonist approaching Aki to revenge and pay everything back from that trauma he had 8 years ago in Aki mansion. Season 2 on another hands,...the first 4 eps are acceptable, okay, decent, unique, manifest how sensitive his judgement and reassess the situation happening back then 8 years ago after hearing Aki story, which makes me feel like: ""Damn this Masamune is damn smart and intellectual!"" I mean yeah he got absolute point during entrance test as a transferred student, so basically no doubt. However, shit comes real quick right after Yoshino revealed the truth that Aki didn\'t give him a name Pig foot, showing her past trauma where Yoshino was envious with Masamune 8 years ago because majority of Aki time was spent with Masamune instead of Yoshino, which was the primary course of action to Yoshino disguising as Aki to give Masamune trauma. (CENTRAL REASON OF THE PLOT WHERE DRAMA, REVENGE PLAN STARTED)THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE DROPPED RIGHT AWAY AT EP 4 AND 5:The occurrence on the end of Ep.4 and beginning of ep.5. I mean the motivation and long-life purpose that Masamune has himself attached to grind and cultivate for freaking 8 years in rural Shushi area where has no internet or any external connection to real world just to revenge has been easily slipped off like what? ""okay I accidentally said to Aki please go on a date with me just to save her from Gatsuo so I had to screw and made the rest ep become shiet and no sense""Despite the fact that all of the past trauma was clarified/justified as a misunderstanding due to Yoshino disguised Aki, which means Masamune himself couldn\'t be able to hold a deep animosity toward Aki as well as Yoshino who has been regretting her actions for 8 years long too. Then what is point of Masamune right now? What is the point of being present for the rest 8 eps in the show of season2? -> Proceed to go on a date with Aki and enjoyed it like a completely new anime which has no attachment or any connection to the previous 4 eps of season 2 and 12 eps of season 1.So during this point, the show should have manifested something called internal conflict in Masamune, he is top student who has absolute point during the entrance test, he is not that stupid where he couldn\'t see through his current problem where the long life purpose is to revenge disappears in a sudden. And that is not because he saying wanting to date Aki means it is compulsory of him to do so. At least, he should have showed certain concern how to deal with the relationship where he now doesn\'t have true love for Aki. In fact, there is no point of getting into relationship with Aki anymore, since the initial plan itself is making Aki falling in love then reject her eventually to create a shock trauma like he had 8 years ago. And it is completely crystal clear that there is no love manifested by Masamune toward Aki in 8 years journey seeking for revenge.Showing more screen time how he fights against his feeling and confliction instead of showing stupid activities where it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY RIGHT NOW! Showing how he deals with his relationship where his true love doesn\'t exist, where his feeling concealed at somewhere else in the hidden frog, showing how he has to deal with the fact that he is walking right down to Neko\'s path and overcomes the destination where Neko has to stop due to how superficially she rushed into a relationship with shallow and empty purposes like season1?????????Story: 5.8/10If you have nothing but time to waste, continue and watch the rest ep after ep.5. From my perspective, I only judge and rate anime after fully completed and getting all the details of the story, since I am a big fan of this series 7 years ago. It was part of my childhood memories, but how unfortunate it is to witness the downgrade version of this anime after 7 years waiting.In conclusion, Saying that doesn\'t mean the anime not good but mostly the plot itself, if you attach to story plot and more into sensical things like character development, then surely this is utterly terrible. But if you are enjoying some good cool lines, then Neko is the best in this anime for the rest ep.Character develpoment:Masamune: 3/10 ( Exhibits outstanding student with sharpness logic thinking but so fuking dumb in the end of ep.4 )Aki: 6.7/10 ( Decent development well written, doesn\'t have any flaw however not to the point where she is completely outstanding in comparison with Neko -> which created a stupid plot hole where Masamune choose Aki instead of Neko )Yoshino: 2/10 ( Her behave goes completely opposite what she has been doing, the turn 180 degree in 12 minutes of ep.8 or 9 which created a stupid dumbshiet plot hole again, not to mention the show didn\'t sshow her feeling toward Masamune as well but at a sudden turn into a competitor competing with Aki?????

The Animation in this series is downgraded and from episode 3 onwards it’s not even “Masamune-kuns revenge” but more like “Masamune-kuns Relationships and random drama” due to the useless events that happen after Masamune and Adagaki kinda got together like I feel like the author ran out of ideas before trying to make up for it with a bunch of useless drama like all he did was prolong the happy ending before he breaks it.

And if you have, you probably like this series and will thus disagree with me.  Basically, don’t read this review for any reason.The anime industry seems to have finally learned that making sequels is a good idea, as many popular series are finally breaking their future-depriving curses: After many agonizing years, beloved anime like Bleach, Mahouka, Konosuba and Isekai Smartphone have all made highly anticipated recent comebacks, with even Spice and Wolf having something on the horizon.  Of...course, it’s not a party without a few guests that literally nobody in the entire world (I’ve decided I speak for everyone now) asked for or is happy to see join in, like Mushoku Tensei.  Or Masamune-kun’s Revenge.Not that this series and critique is about me, but in 2017 my review of the first season said word-for-word: “Oh god, could you imagine a second season of this?”  That wasn’t meant to be a challenge for the industry to manifest my worst nightmares, rather it was a mark of disproving bewilderment at the series’ own lack of execution.  It opened with the promise of a likable, easy-to-root-for main character getting one over on a rude, bratty, insufferable antagonist who had wronged him in the past.  It’s so easy to imagine Masamune-kun as fun, quirky take on the romantic comedy genre with its (promised) anti-romantic conclusion, one that could easily fill a 12-episode run; but instead, all progress eventually leads to… uh… I’m not really sure what the point is anymore, actually.Let’s be clear, I didn’t expect anything from this season.  I’m over the first season’s lack of conclusiveness.  I watched S2 because some bone in my brain insisted on knowing what in the world could even happen to this weird series at this point.  The first season swerved off course so hard with its many retcons and rewrites of what I thought the series was that I wonder if all of this is some kind of prank by the author.  A prank, or just a means of milking a series so that it extends to infinity like Saw (hey, there’s another weirdly revived series), whatever.  I’m wondering what kind of weird excuses this story is going to give itself so it may continue chasing its own tail.I’ll give you a brief rundown of this season: Masamune-kun (the show) continues its parade of nonsense for another few episodes, picking up where last season ended mid-arc and “resolving” its weird plot holes and inconsistencies.  And then the weirdest thing happens: it becomes a straight-up, almost no-nonsense romantic drama.  I mean, the series wasn’t at all funny to begin with, but it hardly even attempts to be in the back end, as various character arcs converge into a big emotional climax that’s yet another sucker punch to the audience.  You WON’T believe what happens next (Episode 10 will SHOCK you!!!!!!!)Of course, that’s *still* not enough to end this series, because somehow there’s a sequel manga after this (although it still counts as the original manga but it has another name???  Somehow this has to be needlessly complicated as well) which I will just accept to be adapted some time later and I’ll take my L now.  I mean it “ends” in the way that a Pokemon game “ends” when you beat the Elite Four or whatever, the gang goes on more adventures later and shit, where was I again?  I got lost, I thought this was about getting revenge on someone.  Spoilers, there is no revenge to be gotten in this series titled Masamune-kun’s Revenge.Turns out the entire cause of the plot itself is one big, hilarious and super kooky misunderstanding, as is the case for all brilliantly-written stories.  This season really delivers some banger plot twists like “Actually the girl who made fun of Masamune as a kid was just someone who disguised herself to look and sound completely identical to Adagaki and then they felt bad so they later orchestrated everything else later as an apology.”  Because, uh, admitting to the people whose lives were quite literally ruined from this experience just isn’t a funny plot detail.  Just like how the fat kid who showed up at the end of season 1 isn’t some nice guy in an arranged marriage with Aki for business reasons, they’re actually orchestrating some weird, manipulative plot to take her money and also they’re not even a guy???It seems this series is more of a spectacle of nonsensical writing, kind of like famously convoluted series such as Saw (how did this get mentioned twice here?) and Kingdom Hearts where part of its audience probably does truly engage with and enjoy the twists, but another part of it is just laughing at how weird the excuses to make things happen get.  Why do Masamune-kun (the character) and Aki spend time together in the first place?  Because if they don’t, some Fr*nch guy is gonna sic the mafia on them unless his weeb sister harasses them into inspiring a rom-com manga for her.  I didn’t make any of that up.  I wish I had the courage to write things this obnoxious; instead I settled for the fortuitous path of the MyAnimeList reviewer.It might be a good time to mention they go to Fr*nce (trigger warning) and meet the most annoying character ever, but she more-or-less disappears from the story after a couple episodes and nothing she does is of any consequence.  I love having my time wasted!Credit where it’s due, I suppose, there is tangible progress made towards the revenge ending, finally.  Masamune the Tokyo Non-Revenger achieves step 1 of getting Adagakiakiakiakiakiaki to like him, woo yeah baby that’s what we’ve all been waiting for etc.  But this comes so laughably late into the story that the driving motivation to bring about that revenge is dissolved.  So once the series finally approaches its endgame, it takes on a completely new, never-before-seen identity: the boring, generic romantic drama, where the entire female population of argues over who gets to win the Reddit Best Girl contest and the main character mentally scrambles about wondering who he wants to vote for.  Is it the girl whose main personality is wearing no panties and……………………………………… Is it the girl who was supposed to be the main antagonist???  Or could it be the soft-voiced and softer-chested maid girl who actually has some semblance of chemistry with him???  I wonder which character I’m supposed to root for!!!Credit where it’s due, again, this emphatically dramatic tone of the second half is actually a much more tolerable version of the series.  There’s not much I can say to criticize and make fun of it; it just comes at the consequence of being really, really boring.  I mean, this is just my personal, subjective, biased, totally not yours dont cancel me opinion, but with a cast so boring and a plot so jumbled up, I wasn’t all that interested in the nuanced and in-depth (I’m saying this to be nice) emotional arcs of… anyone, really.  I wanted the revenge ending.

In my head I shipped these two together (a headcanon, one might say) as it felt like the only thing that made any amount of sense in this series.  It’s nice that, in a series that is so nonsensical, it can at least end in a way that makes sense.…Just kidding.  Of course that doesn’t actually happen.  Masamune and Yoshino are so well-established of a couple that he literally gets physically sick around everyone but her, but she isn’t the poster girl of the series so of course she doesn’t win.  Eh, whatever.  It’s not that big of a deal to me; in fact I could… kind of see the logic of this relationship remaining non-platonic.  While it’s not mind-blowing character writing, relationships forming and breaking as a result of people being more exposed to each other becomes a theme for the latter part of the series.  I can appreciate that.I feel like I could go on, but doing so would uselessly extend my feelings of this season and the series as a whole, and who am I to make things too long while complaining about things being too long.  Masamune-kun’s Revenge Season R, which is a way-too-easy setup for an offensive joke, is not very good.  That goes for the series as a whole.  I didn’t find it funny, didn’t laugh, lost subscriber, but the second half of this season made small improvements by turning into a faceless romantic drama instead.  It now simply occupies the category of anime for sickos who love it when conflict is generated by characters not talking to each other.  It retains its below-average production values with its crudely drawn, mediocre character designs and its over-exciting soundtrack and a star-studded voice cast each giving in inoffensively uninspiring performances.Maybe it's poetic; at first I assumed this would be a passably generic 5/10 or so and I’d be fine with that.  That actually happened towards the end. It just… took a while to get there.  Kind of like how Masamune and Adagaki accepted each other, rejected each other, and became decently accepting friends of each other by the end.

Or Masamune-kun’s Revenge.Not that this series and critique is about me, but in 2017 my review of the first season said word-for-word: “Oh god, could you imagine a second season of this?”  That wasn’t meant to be a challenge for the industry to manifest my worst nightmares, rather it was a mark of disproving bewilderment at the series’ own lack of execution.  It opened with the promise of a likable, easy-to-root-for main character getting one over on a rude, bratty, insufferable antagonist who had wronged him in the past.  It’s so easy to imagine Masamune-kun as fun, quirky take on the romantic comedy genre with its (promised) anti-romantic conclusion, one that could easily fill a 12-episode run; but instead, all progress eventually leads to… uh… I’m not really sure what the point is anymore, actually.Let’s be clear, I didn’t expect anything from this season.  I’m over the first season’s lack of conclusiveness.  I watched S2 because some bone in my brain insisted on knowing what in the world could even happen to this weird series at this point.  The first season swerved off course so hard with its many retcons and rewrites of what I thought the series was that I wonder if all of this is some kind of prank by the author.  A prank, or just a means of milking a series so that it extends to infinity like Saw (hey, there’s another weirdly revived series), whatever.  I’m wondering what kind of weird excuses this story is going to give itself so it may continue chasing its own tail.I’ll give you a brief rundown of this season: Masamune-kun (the show) continues its parade of nonsense for another few episodes, picking up where last season ended mid-arc and “resolving” its weird plot holes and inconsistencies.  And then the weirdest thing happens: it becomes a straight-up, almost no-nonsense romantic drama.  I mean, the series wasn’t at all funny to begin with, but it hardly even attempts to be in the back end, as various character arcs converge into a big emotional climax that’s yet another sucker punch to the audience.  You WON’T believe what happens next (Episode 10 will SHOCK you!!!!!!!)Of course, that’s *still* not enough to end this series, because somehow there’s a sequel manga after this (although it still counts as the original manga but it has another name???  Somehow this has to be needlessly complicated as well) which I will just accept to be adapted some time later and I’ll take my L now.  I mean it “ends” in the way that a Pokemon game “ends” when you beat the Elite Four or whatever, the gang goes on more adventures later and shit, where was I again?  I got lost, I thought this was about getting revenge on someone.  Spoilers, there is no revenge to be gotten in this series titled Masamune-kun’s Revenge.Turns out the entire cause of the plot itself is one big, hilarious and super kooky misunderstanding, as is the case for all brilliantly-written stories.  This season really delivers some banger plot twists like “Actually the girl who made fun of Masamune as a kid was just someone who disguised herself to look and sound completely identical to Adagaki and then they felt bad so they later orchestrated everything else later as an apology.”  Because, uh, admitting to the people whose lives were quite literally ruined from this experience just isn’t a funny plot detail.  Just like how the fat kid who showed up at the end of season 1 isn’t some nice guy in an arranged marriage with Aki for business reasons, they’re actually orchestrating some weird, manipulative plot to take her money and also they’re not even a guy???It seems this series is more of a spectacle of nonsensical writing, kind of like famously convoluted series such as Saw (how did this get mentioned twice here?) and Kingdom Hearts where part of its audience probably does truly engage with and enjoy the twists, but another part of it is just laughing at how weird the excuses to make things happen get.  Why do Masamune-kun (the character) and Aki spend time together in the first place?  Because if they don’t, some Fr*nch guy is gonna sic the mafia on them unless his weeb sister harasses them into inspiring a rom-com manga for her.  I didn’t make any of that up.  I wish I had the courage to write things this obnoxious; instead I settled for the fortuitous path of the MyAnimeList reviewer.It might be a good time to mention they go to Fr*nce (trigger warning) and meet the most annoying character ever, but she more-or-less disappears from the story after a couple episodes and nothing she does is of any consequence.  I love having my time wasted!Credit where it’s due, I suppose, there is tangible progress made towards the revenge ending, finally.  Masamune the Tokyo Non-Revenger achieves step 1 of getting Adagakiakiakiakiakiaki to like him, woo yeah baby that’s what we’ve all been waiting for etc.  But this comes so laughably late into the story that the driving motivation to bring about that revenge is dissolved.

It’s April Fools’ Day in Japan, and we’re all rolling our eyes at the 82392nd joke about No Game No Life Season 2 being announced, and I’m sure many were also thinking the Masamune-kun sequel was also fake. Turns out they trolled us hard, and here we are with Season 2 of the dumpster fire that is Masamune-kun’s Revenge. I hated Season 1 a lot, because I thought it could be good, but it just ruined every possible good, or heartfelt, emotional moment with some stupidity. Season 2 has these problems as well, but it turned out to be more entertaining this...time around, due to the numerous twists that this anime throws at you. Feelings change, and the plot actually progressed quite a lot, and while the road was pretty rocky, it got some enjoyment out of me, and I’ll honestly take that over Season 1 any day.Revenge is still the theme of the this season, at least at first. I never really liked the revenge aspect of this anime because it was pretty obvious that Masamune was never really going to get revenge, and would probably end up falling in love with Aki anyway. I do like how Season 2 explores these feelings, as well as the motives and feelings of the other characters as well. This season is a bit more than just revenge, it does have some drama. Is it good drama? Yes and no, but the twists were what kept me going in this season.Animation wise, it didn’t look all that great at points with off model faces and goofy eyes and all that, but it was pretty standard for the most part, a slight downgrade from Season 1, but still acceptable.As with many romance shows of this nature, the main couple was frustrating to watch, though there were some cute moments mixed in there. If only they actually communicated with each other am I right? Or am I asking for too much from a romance anime? Yoshino, the maid, had the best moments in my opinion, just like in Season 1. She honestly carries the show, and possibly redeems it from being utter garbage. The other characters don’t have huge roles, apart from the villain, and they have their respective moments to shine, but they turned out to be forgettable.In the end, is the story good? No. Did I hate it though? No. Why didn’t I hate it? I don’t really know. I was overall pleasantly surprised that I somewhat enjoyed this season despite hating the first season, and was surprised at some of the developments this season.

I never wrote any review on MAL before but I had to say it. It was one of my most enticipated anime this season. I'm almost as disappointed as with ataraku maou-sama season 2.

It feels surreal.Honestly, consider me surprised.  I half-expected things to go largely in the same vein as last season, as in slow, back-and-forths, and ladened with barbed dialogue.  Shockingly, however, this season jumped right into the plot and in less than half the episodes already provided resolutions (firm and temp) to many of the overarching questions...and problems posed last season.  Instantly the whole thing with Gasou is settled, the whole ""why can\'t Aki recognize Masamune"" thing, and even cuts to the chase on Masamune\'s whole twisted personality.  Just kudos to the mangaka for writing so efficiently; normally this isn\'t really worth noting, manga and episodic anime pacing are totally different things but the quickness with which Revenge R eschews the old questions with answers is awesome, meaning that any expectations are thrown out the window.  Heck, one of the things that was this season\'s calling cards was a brand new girl but Muriel was merely there to provide a perspective for one episode and then she vanishes, pretty efficient and quite unexpected!  I like that.  ""New character?  Nope!  One time use and she\'s outta here!""The narrative we\'re then presented with is a slightly unpredictable affair with some very good soap opera-like cliffhangers.  Unlike those The Bold and the Beautifuls and Coronation Streets of daytime TV, however, the drama here actually works really well, the lack of firm footing at the beginnings lends suspense as each episode seems to want to pull the series and its characters into different directions.  It\'s something I\'d normally roll my eyes at with other series but it works really, truly well here.The art style is an interesting change.  I don\'t know if the change was to bring the series\' art style closer to the manga or if the semi-realism of Season 1 being picked up by other studios caused them to want to change it here but I like it.

I read the manga over and over again. The story is unique, fresh and unpredictable. It's quite enjoyable to read. I think most stories in that generation more or less like that. Therefore, I am very much looking forward to the continuation of the anime which in the previous season ended up hanging.But once again, the studio crushed my hopes. There have been several times when anime that I've been waiting for were made carelessly. All the good scenes I was looking forward to were done half-heartedly. I started to question why they decided to take on this project if...they weren't serious about it.The art is ordinary, more like bad. The way the characters move and behave looks very stiff and irrational. Although some scenes are forced to use the images in the manga, but come on, if the scene is made to move, don't make it look like pieces of spliced images. Make it smoother so it looks more natural.

I first watched the first season of this show a long time ago, and that\'s about the biggest complement I can give this show. Despite some bumps along the way, I found the first season entertaining, and long-awaited a second season. But, this is what we got?Now that the whole story has been presented, I can\'t grasp the creators\' objective. It had such an intriguing start - a male MC who wasn\'t the typical good boy, and a female MC who could have had more depth beyond just being a violent tsundere for the sake of it. Yes, we had the...""childhood friend"" of the MC with a disease that, while only relevant at times, I could still take her character seriously. But basically our main character, Makabe had a crush on the tsundere, Aki, when he was younger. Except back then, he wasn\'t in the best of shapes. So ""Aki"" rejected him and broke his heart. He\'s held a grudge ever since. Now his goal is to make her fall in love with him so that he could dump her.But then what happened? The anime just stopped at a weird place and was gone and after five years it got renewed for a second season. So we dive into the second season of Masamune-kun no Revenge and, without my knowledge, the anime became stranger and weaker with each episode after the last arc of the first season.Also remember that whole revenge thing that the narrative revolves over, well, this season, that premise pretty much resolves itself, but in the end, nothing substantial changes. I was hoping for a bit more, but I suppose I underestimated just how clueless Makabe can be. His lack of common sense really got on my nerves this season. For instance, in episode six, he takes Aki on a movie date and buys her two tickets for two different seats, simply because he wasn\'t sure if she planned on sitting beside him. On their date. Come on, dude, I know you\'re not that dim. At least now I understand what the ""R"" stands for in the title of this season.I think the creators wanted to inject some madness into the show, introducing a plot twist and then going even bigger than the first, leading us to explore the minds of the main characters in just a couple of episodes before the finale. Perhaps that wasn\'t a good idea (and at the same time, I wouldn\'t have had faith in more episodes).I also can\'t emphasize enough how fast-paced this season was, to the point that it did a disservice to all its characters. Consider this: the side characters received no development whatsoever, unlike the main characters. So, how am I supposed to become invested in one-dimensional characters? Each episode felt incredibly rushed, but that didn\'t bother me too much. It was enough to keep me engaged with the show. And believe me, the plot twists in the first season were so engaging that I couldn\'t help but race to the end! Only to be pranked. All the creators did was play with your emotions and retcon those final episodes.I can\'t help but think that after deciding on the main idea of the show, the creators relied solely on the power of the plot twists until the end. And while that wouldn\'t be a problem in itself, the real issue lies in how the creators executed them. This show could have been one of those that I fondly remember in the future, but in the end, I only have a headache as I write this, with the hope of feeling better afterwards. I guess the takeaway from this show is every girl can be best girl, every girl can still be a contender right until the very end.Overall: 6/10, I don\'t find myself ever going back to this show, just a show you can turn your brain off and laugh at how stupid the shit that happens in it is.

It reduces the unnecessary secondary characters from the first season. While it introduces characters like Muriel early on, it\'s not a significant issue.The pacing of the story in this season is much tighter, which is a plus. However, the rapid shifts in mood, especially in the comedy aspects, can be excessive. The fast-paced storytelling can sometimes make it challenging to connect with the characters\' emotions effectively.The character Adagaki Aki displays significant development, especially stemming from the latter part of the first season. At that time, Aki begins to...develop feelings for Masamune, and she becomes much more determined to pursue him.

However, it is later revealed that Aki still desires to be with Masamune, as seen in episode 9.The problem arises when Aki supports Yoshino in pursuing a romantic relationship with Masamune and indirectly contributes to Masamune\'s decision to leave her behind. Aki\'s actions in the series, particularly the scene in which she sees Masamune hugging Yoshino with his genuine feelings in episode 8, could have had a more substantial impact on her character. If her character had seen it differently, it would have had a more profound influence on Aki\'s decision-making process, making her character development even more pronounced.Regarding Makabe Masamune, the show doesn\'t expand much on the issue of bullying and body image compared to what could have been done.

I’m going to cut straight to the point and say this series should be renamed “Masamune-kun can’t Revenge”.I’m honestly sick and tired of modern anime story writing like this one. There is zero follow through on the plot and the characters are completely one dimensional just so the same old tropes can be re hashed in the most uninteresting fashion.What interested me in the series in the first place was the petty revenge plot point. I just wanted to have a good laugh at the sorry excuse of a main characters’ expense (because let’s face it, everyone in here was a loser)....One would think with the story summary anyway. To my surprise there was zero revenge at any point in the story. The way things were going I had very little faith that Masamune’s revenge would actually follow through. That he would inevitably wind up completely falling for her and winning her heart and they would live happily ever after because…of course. It’s a romcom. However, what I got was much much worse. The series ended by thoroughly beating me to death with the most mundane and over used anime tropes in all of anime. A culture festival. The Japanese must love culture festival episodes so much that it has completely drained the well dry. Don’t forget the beloved beach episode that happens in every anime ever. This gem left none of these painful tropes out. This is why I tend to skip over a lot of anime if it involves high school/middle school students because it has to remind me that it is anime with a culture festival or karaoke or both and this show had it all. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought they would comprise of the entire ENDING (or lack thereof). As of episode 11, there was zero development in the characters or the half assed plot by this point but I hung on. I kept trying to believe the show was going to do a 180 that I couldn’t possibly have predicted. To my dismay, there was none. In fact, you can hardly call this disasterpiece an actual conclusion. Masamune didn’t get the girl or the revenge. We are left with two hollow human beings that still pretend to hate each other and a japanese sweet potato trope (that makes 4 now!). I don’t normally write reviews, in fact this is my first one on MAL, but I detested this series so much that after finally getting off this romance seesaw of an anime I felt it necessary to inform you all to save your time and don’t bother with fuckboi Masamune and his nonexistent revenge.

My expectations were much higher after watching season one, the story was really interesting and i looked forward for them to get together, but when they did it was quite disappointing.I expected a wholesome relationship that would occasionally put a little smirk on my face with their awkward and cute interactions, BUTthe anime decided to stall the relationship EVEN MORE, after that happened the season has gradually become boring.There are much better romance anime's out there, Masamune-kun's revenge deffinitely could have easily be...considered one of those romance anime's but they just ruined it, the synopsis was not that common and was interesting.Though i do still have some hope the story turns around.

The anime was a bit rushed at times and I would of liked more into the story, like mini arcs about the characters for example. However, pacing was not too terrible and I can really say this is one of the better anime to watch. One thing to note is that this season heavily focuses on the romance, not like the parody of season 1, which was still fine and am one of the few people that actually enjoyed it.Characters:Masamune was really funny to watch.  Yoshino was given great character development this season,...I wish she ended up with Masamune though. Aki was annoying as usual, Fujinomiya made the plot pretty stale as supposed to in season 1. The side characters were not really used as much and I wished that they were heavily impacted by the story, would have made things better in my opinion. I wish she ended up with Masamune though.

Back in 2017, I was an entire newbie as an anime watcher but a Naruto die-hard fan. Masamune kun no Revenge is on my list of anime that I really wish to have another season of, as the concept of the story is remarkable, and I would never have thought I would be writing a review for the second season of it after 6 years.Although I can barely remember what happened in the first season, the MC, Makabe Masamune, left no stone unturned in seeking revenge, and...to achieve that, the girl who used to be his childhood friend and had turned into a tsundere must fall in love with him in the first place without recognising him. Just the background story of the main characters is enough to make the show unprecedented. However, more kinds of unpredictable settings came along along the way, and you can only feel surprised following the plot.Frankly, the anime isn’t disappointing, and I think it makes a brilliant comeback. The start of the second season is merely amazing, as it continues to break my cognition of the show in the second season. As I am not a manga reader, the story is quite surprising to me once the truth behind the misconception within the love triangle (Koiwai, Masamune, and Adagaki) has been revealed. My perspective towards Adagaki and Koiwai has totally reversed since the misconception was exposed, and I am now totally on Adagaki’s side, whereas initially I was not.Talking about the plot from an overall viewpoint, the pace of season 2 might seem to be rushed, or some cuts of the story might jump up out of nowhere. Anyway, I do enjoy all the absurd yet astounding plot twists and outcomes of every episode. It’s been a good time to see such a rom-com with entertaining drama.Other than the plot, the adaptation of animation and visuals has been done so well that it doesn’t really influence me , what i mean is that it's still within my acceptable range and I did not expect for once that this animation would be completely spotless at all. In this case, the uniformity of animation is slightly slacked off. However, the story and OST has its own special vibes that live up to its role in making the anime memorable.Last but not least, the successful adaptation of the second season without broken animation is really a blessing, and I have got to say it’s a decent moment in the ACG community. Although the original source has not ended yet, the full stop is put in the right spot in season 2. We would be lucky if there will be a season 3 by any chance in the future. Whatever it is, season 2 has been thrilling. Words can't describe how grateful I am to those who made this happen after years, and hopefully we can get more sequels for other old anime that people have been longing for. to achieve that, the girl who used to be his childhood friend and had turned into a tsundere must fall in love with him in the first place without recognising him.

As I am not a manga reader, the story is quite surprising to me once the truth behind the misconception within the love triangle (Koiwai, Masamune, and Adagaki) has been revealed. My perspective towards Adagaki and Koiwai has totally reversed since the misconception was exposed, and I am now totally on Adagaki’s side, whereas initially I was not.Talking about the plot from an overall viewpoint, the pace of season 2 might seem to be rushed, or some cuts of the story might jump up out of nowhere. Anyway, I do enjoy all the absurd yet astounding plot twists and outcomes of every episode. It’s been a good time to see such a rom-com with entertaining drama.Other than the plot, the adaptation of animation and visuals has been done so well that it doesn’t really influence me , what i mean is that it's still within my acceptable range and I did not expect for once that this animation would be completely spotless at all. In this case, the uniformity of animation is slightly slacked off. However, the story and OST has its own special vibes that live up to its role in making the anime memorable.Last but not least, the successful adaptation of the second season without broken animation is really a blessing, and I have got to say it’s a decent moment in the ACG community. Although the original source has not ended yet, the full stop is put in the right spot in season 2. We would be lucky if there will be a season 3 by any chance in the future. Whatever it is, season 2 has been thrilling. Words can't describe how grateful I am to those who made this happen after years, and hopefully we can get more sequels for other old anime that people have been longing for."", ""Masamune-kun's Revenge R is the second season of Masamune-kun's Revenge, a show which first aired over 7 years ago. I was honestly pretty surprised to see that the show actually got a second season after all this time. I had quite mixed feelings about the first season, as while I enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure for the most part, it wasn't necessarily particularly good, the characters were not very likeable, some of its themes were a bit problematic, and a few things were, for a lack of a better word, a bit cringey. Still, I knew that I was going to watch the second...season, and I wanted to finish the show.After finishing it, however, my feelings are still mixed. The characters grew a lot more on me in this season, I liked some of the story developments, and I appreciated that they addressed both the theme of facing old bullies, albeit very briefly, and the main characters' problematic relationship with food and eating, even if they didn't do it perfectly. However, the pacing and the timing of certain plot elements in this season were a bit off. It started out fine, but around the middle, things started to become a bit confusing. Parts of the story that turned out not to really matter were dragged out for way too long, while other parts that were actually essential to the plot were glossed over. The characters sometimes suddenly did things out of the blue that didn't make a lot of sense. Also, a lot about the ending seemed rushed and was kind of confusing to me.The ending is also where I have the most mixed feelings. Although, I like Masamune and Aki as a couple, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not have him end up with Yoshino, once she was established as one of the possible love interests. After all, the show is called Masamune-kun's Revenge, and the main plot is centred around Masamune wanting to get revenge on Aki for breaking his heart as a kid by making her fall in love with him and then break up up with her, thereby breaking her heart right back. Even though, it turned out that the truth about what happened when they were kids was more complicated than Masamune first thought, I would've still liked for the revenge theme to be in there. There would've been something bittersweet about Masamune giving up on his revenge plan and Aki falling in love with him, and then having him break up with her and essentially break her heart anyway and not on purpose by finding out that he was really in love with Yoshino. I think that would've tied a nice bow on the story in a way.What set the first season apart was the way the revenge theme was done. The first season was actually somewhat intriguing, in that it had that. The second season, however, deviates from this theme about a third of the way through and becomes more of a standard rom-com. This was a bit of a shame, however, it also gave way for especially Masamune's and Aki's characters to grow, and I quite liked them as a couple and thus a lot of the scenes between them in the second half. Still, it would've made better sense for me to have Masamune end up with Yoshino rather than Aki considering the overarching story, even if I like him and Aki more as a couple.To conclude, I am very conflicted by this second season on many accounts. However, I did enjoy watching it, so I don't want to judge it too harshly. I would say that if you enjoyed the first season to some degree, you'll probably have a good time watching the second one as well - improvements, flaws, possible missed opportunities, and all. season, and I wanted to finish the show.After finishing it, however, my feelings are still mixed.

While the complexities of relationships can add depth to a story, Masamune-kun's Revenge R seems to revel in the chaos, presenting viewers with convoluted and often juvenile plotlines....The attempt to inject drama into the narrative overshadows the comedic elements, making the series feel more like a melodramatic exploration of romantic entanglements.The characters, unfortunately, continue to lack redeeming qualities. Instead of evolving and becoming more relatable, they remain stagnant or devolve into even more unlikable versions of themselves.

But after finishing it, it just left me feeling both satisfied and dissatisfied.First of all, the animation was disappointing, to say the least. Their weird movements were a bit hard to watch at times. But hey, I watch these mostly for the story, right? I wanted to see how everything would turn out for Masamune and Aki.But the story was confusing, oddly paced at times, and unnatural. They introduced so many plots that didn't seem to have a proper closure or understanding. Although, I liked...the ending, and it was the ending that I had always hoped for. But every twist and turn they took before it seemed almost unnecessary. Or maybe it wasn't explained enough or stretched out enough. I don't know.

Otherwise not recommended."", ""With more dramatic story beats, interpersonal and intrapersonal conflicts, and a steady forward momentum to draw out and expand the romantic implications laid out in the first season, Masamune-kun no Revenge R is a strong sequel that brings finality and tackles the consequences of Masamune's plot to exact revenge on Aki. Does his plan come to fruition? Does Masamune realize how ridiculous his plan is? What is its aftermath and how do the characters truly feel about themselves and each other? Season 2 is a recommended watch for viewers seeking answers to these questions and the branching ramifications they imply.This second season of Masamune aired...quite long after the first season, so it makes sense that there are more callbacks to and recaps of the first season than many other second-seasons. However, the season does a good job keeping these callbacks concise and limiting them to the most important details to establish the setting and conflicts, doing decently well enough that a season 1 rewatch wouldn't be necessary to be caught up to speed with the plot and its characters. Masamune-kun no Revenge R does a great job of portraying its characters as multi-layered with personal disquietudes: they are not perfect and flawless, but they are not one-dimensionally awful, either. The characters come to realize this, too, and Aki, Neko, Yoshino, and Masamune all have their share of thoughtful introspection, developing and nursing moral conflict in the pursuit of romance. Season 2 does rely on the often-used trope of romantic misunderstandings to create dramatic tension, but allows its characters to muster the courage to directly address these misunderstandings to each other without dragging them out for too long. However, the show's proactiveness to resolve misunderstanding runs a little too quickly sometimes, and in some instances doesn't allow struggles and reactions to marinate and grow organically before moving along with the story. In some spots the pacing of season 2 quickly runs through what should be important transitions: the show often backpedals by showing the aftermath of a critical event first and then portraying that event as a flashback or monologue rather than telling the story straight-up, which would probably be more fulfilling and engaging. That said, it is refreshing to see that the misunderstandings and realizations that come to shape the intentions of the central characters are taken seriously and have meaningful consequences regarding how characters see each other. Aki continues to come across as a bit stubbornly annoying in this season and the series sometimes seems hesitant to scale down the tsundere mold at times, but the other core characters provide a convincing and engaging presence.Masamune-kun no Revenge R features more drama than the first season, but it's more of a slight curve in emotional tone rather than a sharp change. A balanced romantic/comedic atmosphere still prevails, and the season mostly does a good job in not spoiling its more dramatic moments with random comedy, as well as regularly maintaining its funny moments. The opening arc involving Muriel does seem a bit pointless but provides an on-ramp easing the tonal transition from the comedic overtones of the first season to the more dramatic undertones of the second. While most viewers will probably be able to infer the general direction of the plot, this installment throws intriguing wrenches and roadbumps that spice up the road to the series's conclusion. Some of these dramatic details do seem a little manufactured, but thankfully, the show has well-formed and well-established characters that make these twists and turns all the more engaging. The story also stays focused by ensuring that all of these twists are directly connected to the primary thrust of the plot (Masamune's plan to make Aki fall for him and break up as revenge for her coldly rejecting him in childhood).The ending of season 2 concludes the series with a strong sense of finality, though the aforementioned tendency for the story to skip forward and reflect back makes the ending a little unfulfilling, skipping over elaborating how we got there and leaving some questions unanswered for the side characters. The ending is a bit rushed and comes rather suddenly, developing discordantly compared to episode 11, which set up what would have been a very surprising, unique, and sensible ending. Nonetheless, the ending and the trip there that season 2 affords offers an intriguing array of character development and finality that many fans of the first season of Masamune-kun no Revenge will enjoy. quite long after the first season, so it makes sense that there are more callbacks to and recaps of the first season than many other second-seasons.

Like this was meant to be a big issue for Masamune to have to get around but instead she was easily dealt with and...her ulterior motives only come about after the arc which was again really disappointing as this could have been written to be so much more rewarding, but instead it\'s swept under the carpet.Then we begin the main arc where Masamune gives Aki her present and in doing so his whole guide on how to get revenge falls out with it for her to read, showing his dumb motive which was cleared up as a mistake from Yoshino, which also tips the whole reason for the plot in its head making the whole point of Masamunes 8 years of getting fit pointless.This is made aware to Aki and yet she still loves Masamune and also because she feels responsible for him somehow.Now here\'s the very dumb part of the show which was the most poorly written.Aki then dumps Masamune after a date where she introduces him to one of the old bullies which after she determines the relationship is up. This then makes him take a trip to his grandads where inbetween this it is now confirmed that Yoshino now has feelings for Masamune which those feelings only started near the end of the second season. Another really silly thing to bring up for theatrics.So what does Aki do? she tells Yoshino to go and confess to Masamune, which he rejects and instead they change plan to then get Aki to get back with Masamune.You couldn\'t make up how roundabout and silly this is as it proves to be a big waste of time. Where as if it was written better this could have been made more emotional and heartfelt, of a boy who mistakenly got dejected by an old friend and then growing to love her and then changing his whole outlook. But instead we got this dumpster fire with no after story so as to probably try and scrape a 3rd season which won\'t be meaningful and more of a cash grab if it gets the greenlight.As we could\'ve got atleast a bit of after story such as more growth as them as a couple, As we all know you don\'t just get into a relationship and that\'s the end of the story. We saw none of Masamune\'s family meet Aki and it just feels soo unfinished.Now for the worst part. Here\'s one thing which really disappoints me, The hair cutting.The reasoning is stupid behind this. Cutting your hair and trying to give it symbolism to getting over something in a slight rebellious way. So not only do you make Aki look less attractive but also make it pointless due to her getting back with Masamune anyway.To any women reading this by chance, keep your hair long as short hair is just not a nice look in comparison.So for anyone who watched the first season and now thinking of watching the second.

Especially for Fujinomiya Neko it looks very strange compared to the previous season, but for the next few episodes it looks like there be improvements, I hope that in Blue Ray there will be...improvements to the illustrations that look strange, not only the illustrations but the coloring is also different from the previous season, but long- It's taking a long time to get used to seeing it, and some scenes look stiff, but the quality is good even though it's not BD yet.For episodes 1 and 2 I was a little confused, because their relationship was suddenly close and very different from Masamune's concept of revenge, but fortunately in the continuing episodes it started to return to the initial concept, and the storyline started to be interesting step by step and it started to unfold.As additional closing words, I would like to say thank you for making Season 2 of Masamune's Revenge, the wait was quite long and there was no news about a second season, when I found out that this anime was starting to continue again I felt very happy. improvements to the illustrations that look strange, not only the illustrations but the coloring is also different from the previous season, but long- It's taking a long time to get used to seeing it, and some scenes look stiff, but the quality is good even though it's not BD yet.For episodes 1 and 2 I was a little confused, because their relationship was suddenly close and very different from Masamune's concept of revenge, but fortunately in the continuing episodes it started to return to the initial concept, and the storyline started to be interesting step by step and it started to unfold.As additional closing words, I would like to say thank you for making Season 2 of Masamune's Revenge, the wait was quite long and there was no news about a second season, when I found out that this anime was starting to continue again I felt very happy."", 'Masamune-kun\'s Revenge IS BACK? NANI DA HECK!?Out of all of the past anime that has since got revived for another season years down the road, there were two that got greenlit after the same amount of time: Isekai Smartphone (which first aired in Summer 2017, then its sequel in the last season), and Masamune-kun no Revenge, which first aired all the way back in Winter 2017. The prequel presented us with the anime adaptation up to Volume 6 of the manga, and the sequel is finally here to finish where the anime left off with the remaining volumes 7 to 10. That\'s 6.5 years of...waiting for what seems like an eternity, especially with what the ""R"" in Season 2 is supposed to mean. No spoiler, whatever words that you can think of that start with that letter, you\'re probably right or wrong, the correct word is ""Return"".I remember watching the anime when I first got into seasonal anime all the way back at the start of 2017, thinking that this show would be something revolutionary. Turns out, it was one of Winter 2017\'s hilarious turds that benign almost the majority of its audience, thinking that mangaka Hazuki Takeoka\'s work is a work of art...an overblown, dramatic, work of art, it seems. That said, everybody who had an involvement in the anime, from studio Silver Link\'s core staff to the VAs are back reprising their roles, and this is as much as I can say that it still honours what the original season had going for it all those years ago.It\'s no surprise that Masamune Makabe and his ""harem"" team of girls are back, though this time with the one sole purpose of ending the farce that first spanned from the main characters of Masamune himself, the Cruel Princess Aki Adagaki and her loyal and faithful servant, Yoshino Koiwai. Where we left off with the whole Snow White culture festival business in school that leads to a somewhat unsatisfying cliffhanger back in Season 1 (since the manga still has aways to go), Season 2 leads to the Paris class trip, where the new characters of the Besson siblings, younger sister Muriel and older brother Frank make their official anime appearance, as well as the main villain of the story, the fake Masamune that is Kanetsugu Gasou. The remaining chapters of Volumes 7 to 10 may be a slow burn given that Season 1 took 60% of its content, leaving the remaining 40% to Season 2, is kind of a blessing in disguise that the sequel is able to properly continue the story on a storyboarding level that doesn\'t feel slow nor rushed, as Masamune, Aki, Yoshino and Gasou all attempt their own plans to resolve the ""Pig\'s Foot"" issue once and for all, which can feel intense because there is Masamune\'s reputation at stake, and the reason why the whole ""Pig\'s Foot"" and revenge issue was there to begin with. It still is a convoluted mess of emotions and feelings whether if you have read the manga and oversaw its completion back in 2018 or have kept expectations in check until the ""long-awaited"" sequel came out this season.Otherwise, if you have watched Season 1 back in the day, Season 2 is pretty much more of the same indifference, although Silver Link\'s animation isn\'t the most stellar this time with considerably weaker production values, just for the sole purpose to get the anime done with the manga\'s story. Likewise, Ayaka Ohashi and ChouCho reprises the OST with new songs under their belt, though Season 1 is still the better of the two seasons.In the end, am I surprised at how Masamune-kun\'s Revenge turned out the way that it is, having not read the manga and awaiting any hope for the sequel instead? Probably not, it\'s due to mangaka Hazuki Takeoka just feeling in either one of two camps: the anime flopped so hard that sales are absymal with the negative public reception, or that somehow, through this mess, the original work has to have a resolution forced either way. However, the notion, it\'s safe to say that out from the mess that is this show and the original manga, the subliminal message from this ""boy against girl"" showdown is just a dramatic affair at best.A misunderstanding drama for the ages, that\'s all I can say about Masamune-kun no Revenge. waiting for what seems like an eternity, especially with what the ""R"" in Season 2 is supposed to mean.

', ""Masamune-kun no Revenge R (2023)One of these shows I kept putting off since season 1 and the OVA. Now the second season is done, I decided finally it is time to watch.What did I expect? Harem, Cringe, Awkwardness.What did I get? Harem, Cringe, and a realistic end... sort of.I expected the show to stick with the harem and the main guy to be changed and move forward. What I didn't expect was the web of lies that caused the situation to be so heartwrenching. Imagine where we would be had it not happened. Also, I do like that whilst the girls still...think they will get their chance, which they may! it is nice that some have accepted it won't happen and try to move on. That is great to see for a change rather than all of the other guys just stuck watching this one guy horde, everyone.The show's most realistic aspect is the body. The guy knows, the author knows, and we all know, girls may say it is cute when you are big but that doesn't mean they will date you. So whilst the girls seem to be confused at times about the motivations of the main characters for his body they do make sense to everyone else.The art itself does look really great from start to finish.The sound is nice with lots of emotion.The characters developed a lot in this series. I do wish we saw more of the mum and sister. The French girl thing was kind of random, not that great but not bad. The fem boy things seemed unusual but nice that they tried to break their shell through desire.Overall, it is a very good show, it is not perfect and I don't always think shows like this are meant to be. It isn't a deep dive like others nor is it really a comedy. It is a good 8/10. Another OVA wouldn't be bad either.

Rarely does an individual appear craving some more of Masamune kun, whatever it is supposed to be. So it comes as a rather surprising turn of events that Masamune Kun is back with a second season.Plot: It picks up more or less back from where it left last time if you remember, not to say it had much to live up to. As it stands the Revenge is still ongoing, though certain unaccounted for circumstances have...also begun to appear. If it is not a stretch, and I'm certainly no Manga reader of this so not a spoiler, it seems the Revenge aspect might turn into something entirely opposite to what it was supposed to be in the near future, what that will be remains to be seen. So yeah, be prepared for a few surprises.Characters: There was not much in the department of characters to begin with, not that it is going to radically alter any time soon. For what it's worth if you remember the first season, you'll be more or less clear about everything here as well. For instance, if you can tell which one is the mother and which one in the harem is a boy, you're well set to sally forth, if not, well stranger you're not the first one, and you'll certainly not be the last. Also, maybe expect some French delights.Animation: It's almost the same as the one before, as if animation has not moved on in these last six years. There is nothing worthwhile to mention here so long as you don't happen to purposefully find anything to speak.Music: Standard music, and standard Opening and Ending theme here, nothing to complain about or to rave about.Enjoyment: If someone found enjoyment in the first season, there is no reason for them to not find any enjoyment here. Though, if you were not really impressed to begin with, there is hardly anything to change your opinion as well. also begun to appear.

Meikyuu Black Company,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42340/Meikyuu_Black_Company,"[""This has got the be my pick for the hidden gem of Summer Season 2021. A truly unique and entertaining anime going against almost all of the Isekai genre's Stereotypes. While the show did have a slightly mediocre first few episodes it really picked up it's pace shortly after and became the series i was looking forward to the most each week.First things first, my only real criticism for the show: The production feels really cheap. And while I am not sure whether this was intended or not by the studio, I won't sit here and pretend that it adds some sort of charm to...the show. It doesn't!The art and animation makes you think you are watching something from around 2007. It is another one of those animes where you can't tell if it has more than 2 soundtracks besides OP and ED (which are really good imo btw but more to that later) and while the music is sort of fitting to most scenes and adds at least something to the show, it is nothing to write home about. So if you are hoping for an Unlimited Budget Works production you will find yourself disappointed.Story: The premise of the show is that the Main Character Ninomija, after having achieved success in his own world, is suddenly teleported to another world and immediately turned into a corporate slave by a company that treats it's employees more like drones than sapient beings. His only light at the end of the tunnel: An incredibly cute and OP demon girl with an endless desire for food. The rest of the story is a harder to explain cause it is quite wild, constantly jumping around from one plotpoint to another with the only real overarching storyline being the MC's party trying to get out of the grasps of the evil corporation they are working for.It's a very goofy concept that clearly more intended to entertain than inspire and it does an amazing job at it as i found myself laughing at a good portion of the show while watching. I often found myself at the start of episodes asking myself if i missed something inbetween and exactly that turned out to give the show a lot of it's appeal as you could never expect what was coming next. Despite having it's focus on humor there are many scenes that are either cute, wholesome or even thought proviking.Characters: You rarely see an Anime with a lineup as diverse and loveable as Black Company. The Protagonist is one of the best Male MCs you will come by in the Anime Industry. He is witty, charismatic and doesn't want to take shit from anyone. His problem tho is that he is a weakling in an Isekai world that is ruled by evil industrialism that treats people as labor slaves. Making the Protagonist unable to get out of his predicament on his own. Luckily he ends up being accompanied by a Trap Wizard, an adorable and OP af dragon girl with an unsatiable hunger, a crazy Hero loyal to the evil company and a completely level headed lizard man that would most likely prefer minding his own business rather than being part of this story. Trying his best to act as a leader to this crazy group of people the MC sometimes manages to get things done while failing miserably at others, all while slowly establishing closer relationships with the party's members and having some fun on the way.The Opening of the anime is a very fitting one imo staying true to the goofy vibes that the show is mostly about. However, it is the Ending that is the cherry on top. As i don't want to take anything away from the experience i will have you look it up yourself. All i am saying is is that it puts the Love is War Chika Dance ED to shame.Ultimately i was debating whether this was a 9 or 10 for me and eventually ended up deciding on a 9 as the Anime does an excellent job in the important departments of Characters, Story and overall Entertainment but could have been even greater with a slightly better Animation und Sound usage. Regardless of that a clear recommendation for anyone who is looking for humorful Entertainment. the show. It doesn't!The art and animation makes you think you are watching something from around 2007.

The mc is very cunning and tries to become rich with his wit and thats the basic gist of the show.The best parts of the show is of course the mc, he is cunning, confident , manipulative and does not possess any other special skill, strength or smartphone or anything that...makes him stand out .He does not need to defeat anybody he just want to be rich and he will use anybody for his wishes and it is really entertaining to see him work his ass off.The rest of the cast is also great the lizard guy looks a lot like mc from dorohedoroThe animation style feels somewhat unique, the voice actors and the soundtracks are also done decently.I think a lot of people still are still sleeping on this.Watch the first episode it only gets better from there makes him stand out .He does not need to defeat anybody he just want to be rich and he will use anybody for his wishes and it is really entertaining to see him work his ass off.The rest of the cast is also great the lizard guy looks a lot like mc from dorohedoroThe animation style feels somewhat unique, the voice actors and the soundtracks are also done decently.I think a lot of people still are still sleeping on this.Watch the first episode it only gets better from there"", 'YELP, an Isekai about the pangs of working at a Black Company!? Come save me Work Jesus, for the glory of capitalism!We\'ve seen shows present this topic before, most particularly and recently with Akane Shimizu\'s Hataraku Saibou BLACK a.k.a Cells at Work: Code Black, and it\'s what it is: the etymology of the term ""black company"" where it\'s typical practice to hire a large number of employees, exploit them to work large amounts of overtime without overtime pay with poor conditions, verbal abuse and ""power harassment"" (bullying) by their superiors, threatening them with disrepute if they chose to quit. And you can take all that...and consummate into this series: Youhei Yasumura\'s Dungeon Black Company, which explains how to get your way through a Black Company and rise up the ranks. And the best part obout it, is that everything fits perfectly into the scenario played out.Yeah yeah, it\'s an Isekai first and foremost, but this is one of the few enjoyable Isekai of the Summer season that truly hits all the right spots of a ""rags to riches"" success story of a rollercoaster ride. And nowhere do we spot this than from the perspective of Kinji Ninomiya, voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi, the same person who brought you Jojo Part 5\'s Diavolo and Gurren Lagann\'s Kamiya (and man, his voice absolutely fits the cunning, manipulative of a confident scumbag himself). If you\'ve watched last season\'s Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!, both MCs Combatant Agent No. 6 and Kinji are very similar to one another: they play dirty with their ""bad guy"" despicable mindset, deal with their own evil organization with ulterior motives and manifesting similar comedy vibes (though I feel that Black Company does it better), and to top it up, they have loli partners/supports as well. The ""riches to rags to riches"" story that sees the NEET Ninomiya being Isekai-ed into a fantasy world where he has to start his work dominance over from scratch, and that\'s a pain right there. Along with the relentless obfuscating lesson of hard work and fellow workers that toll with him, it\'s a pain in the butt to having be overworked again by word from negligent superiors, and that\'s where Kinji got the single-best idea of all: to create his own Dungeon Black Company from within and slowly create a coup d\'etat as his calvary charge of retaliation.But in order to create his own organization, Kinji\'s first strategy is just as important as the series\' core progression: its cast of characters whom are comrades also fighting for the same poverty rights. The first worker that Kinji recruits is this crocodilian demi-human named Wanibe, who was his co-worker at the start of the series. And boy, these 2 bore the entirety of the starting phase of revolt against the Raiza\'ha Corporation, which are doing the same thing that Ninomiya once did in his old, accomplished NEET life. From there, the dungeon opens its doors, and slowly but surely, both him and Wanibe hit it off to encounter monsters and fellow workers whom are suffering the same overworked circumstances, fight and recruit them to their side  (like a dungeon for easy proposition to start the topple rumbling from within. The 3rd character of Kinji\'s crusade is arguably one of the most important characters, and is what helps and gives him trouble at the same time: the dragon girl that is Rim. As you would expect, Rim does act like the usual titular dungeon boss character, but you know Kinji, his cunning manipulation got the best of her, and she shapeshifted into a teenage loli just so that she can have meat, regardless of Kinji\'s finanical status. Rim does act on accord because she was the former Demon Lord of the Dungeon, but she got too lazy and bored, and handed the reins over to someone else just so that she could wander free on her own whim. Couple in the dubbed failure of a hero that is Shia and the magic tomboy that is Ranga, and these 5 people form the basis of Kinji\'s unusual adventurer party of the Dungeon Black Company, pushing their way through to the top and achieve Nirvana on Kinji\'s ultimate goal: to rule over others without having to work his butt. If you ask me, this is a sweet deal of a package that I\'m willing to buy, because while the characters aren\'t as unique, but they\'re at the very least entertaining and funny to see their antics spread across the many layers of numerous battles both physically and mentally. It never gets old and stale, and in an Isekai of this calibre where I can sympathize with their sufferings, truly does an equivocal effect of using your brain to work smart, and not work hard.It\'s a fun Isekai show for sure, and what better way to top it off with the VAs which complement the characters so darn freaking well. Rim is voiced by Misaki Kuno, who has been the face of Nanatsu no Taizai\'s favorite talking pig Hawk, and seen as such, Rim is such a comical character who just doesn\'t care and gets what she wants by hook or by crook. Hiro Shimono acting as Wanibe with his voice being a veteran mainstay, and it\'s of no surprise at all. Everyone\'s favourite VA M.A.O voicing Ranga, and I swear if that\'s not the same voice that I heard with Tensei Slime\'s Shion, then she must\'ve got a vocal upgrade. Rounding up the rag-tag crew is Megumi Toda with Shia, and it\'s been awhile since New Game!\'s Hajime\'s voice was featured in an anime (alongside this season\'s Peach Boy Riverside\'s Meki a.k.a Carrot). The manga may be nothing, but the anime helped elevate the manga by a notch with such stellar VA performances.Likewise, Silver Link\'s generic Isekai production substrates have remained the same for a few years now, but to do some experiments with this show is a nice touch that\'s coming from in-house director Mirai Minato. But it\'s just the same that I don\'t really expect much of it anymore, and if it is produced decently, then that\'s all we need. The music though, if I were to compare the OST as a whole in this season, it\'s the sleeper kind of ""it\'s pure unadulterated goodness"". I\'ve come to love both the OP and ED overtime that fits the tone of the show, but more particularly with the ED, because Humbreaders came back strong with their 2nd featured Anisong that is an upgrade when compared to Shin! Chuuka Ichiban S2\'s ED, and both songs evoke the sense of youth overflowing with fun.For those tired with the usual Isekai genericness that we got over the past few years, please, PLEASE, try out Dungeon Black Company. IMO it\'s way lot grounded and better than Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!, and it\'s the same crazed idiocy with the likes of KonoSuba\'s Kazuma if he were ever to get stuck in jobs that would have him procrastinating and whining every second without end. It\'s a strange, yet fascinating Isekai world, and I would not have it in any other way for the time investment of interests well spent, from being lost in the red to profiting much in the green. and consummate into this series: Youhei Yasumura\'s Dungeon Black Company, which explains how to get your way through a Black Company and rise up the ranks.

From there, the dungeon opens its doors, and slowly but surely, both him and Wanibe hit it off to encounter monsters and fellow workers whom are suffering the same overworked circumstances, fight and recruit them to their side  (like a dungeon for easy proposition to start the topple rumbling from within. The 3rd character of Kinji\'s crusade is arguably one of the most important characters, and is what helps and gives him trouble at the same time: the dragon girl that is Rim. As you would expect, Rim does act like the usual titular dungeon boss character, but you know Kinji, his cunning manipulation got the best of her, and she shapeshifted into a teenage loli just so that she can have meat, regardless of Kinji\'s finanical status. Rim does act on accord because she was the former Demon Lord of the Dungeon, but she got too lazy and bored, and handed the reins over to someone else just so that she could wander free on her own whim. Couple in the dubbed failure of a hero that is Shia and the magic tomboy that is Ranga, and these 5 people form the basis of Kinji\'s unusual adventurer party of the Dungeon Black Company, pushing their way through to the top and achieve Nirvana on Kinji\'s ultimate goal: to rule over others without having to work his butt. If you ask me, this is a sweet deal of a package that I\'m willing to buy, because while the characters aren\'t as unique, but they\'re at the very least entertaining and funny to see their antics spread across the many layers of numerous battles both physically and mentally. It never gets old and stale, and in an Isekai of this calibre where I can sympathize with their sufferings, truly does an equivocal effect of using your brain to work smart, and not work hard.It\'s a fun Isekai show for sure, and what better way to top it off with the VAs which complement the characters so darn freaking well. Rim is voiced by Misaki Kuno, who has been the face of Nanatsu no Taizai\'s favorite talking pig Hawk, and seen as such, Rim is such a comical character who just doesn\'t care and gets what she wants by hook or by crook. Hiro Shimono acting as Wanibe with his voice being a veteran mainstay, and it\'s of no surprise at all. Everyone\'s favourite VA M.A.O voicing Ranga, and I swear if that\'s not the same voice that I heard with Tensei Slime\'s Shion, then she must\'ve got a vocal upgrade. Rounding up the rag-tag crew is Megumi Toda with Shia, and it\'s been awhile since New Game!\'s Hajime\'s voice was featured in an anime (alongside this season\'s Peach Boy Riverside\'s Meki a.k.a Carrot). The manga may be nothing, but the anime helped elevate the manga by a notch with such stellar VA performances.Likewise, Silver Link\'s generic Isekai production substrates have remained the same for a few years now, but to do some experiments with this show is a nice touch that\'s coming from in-house director Mirai Minato. But it\'s just the same that I don\'t really expect much of it anymore, and if it is produced decently, then that\'s all we need. The music though, if I were to compare the OST as a whole in this season, it\'s the sleeper kind of ""it\'s pure unadulterated goodness"". I\'ve come to love both the OP and ED overtime that fits the tone of the show, but more particularly with the ED, because Humbreaders came back strong with their 2nd featured Anisong that is an upgrade when compared to Shin! Chuuka Ichiban S2\'s ED, and both songs evoke the sense of youth overflowing with fun.For those tired with the usual Isekai genericness that we got over the past few years, please, PLEASE, try out Dungeon Black Company. IMO it\'s way lot grounded and better than Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!, and it\'s the same crazed idiocy with the likes of KonoSuba\'s Kazuma if he were ever to get stuck in jobs that would have him procrastinating and whining every second without end. It\'s a strange, yet fascinating Isekai world, and I would not have it in any other way for the time investment of interests well spent, from being lost in the red to profiting much in the green.', ""This Is hands down one of the best isekai this season for me, the other being moonlit fantasy , and by my reviews you can tell I watched each one of them .Meikyuu black company , a very subpar manga which I had heard about a year ago .

If that isn't enough to get you to watch this then I don't know what is. After god knows how many Isekai shows with a spineless doormat loser, or a nice guy self-insert genius messiah who brings such great innovations like basic technology and irrigation to Isekailand, it is just so utterly refreshing to see someone this charismatic take the helm of an Isekai.And it's not just that it's an Isekai. Meikyuu Black Company deviates so much from the standard formula, setting, and even style that to call it a typical Isekai would be a great disservice. The show is a...comedy, but it cycles through a gamut of different genres including corporate hell, business management, corporate training, post-apocalypse, that one TTGL dream sequence episode, and even a typical Isekai episode for exactly one episode. The whole show being set in a pre-smartphone post-industrial fantasy setting is certainly novel, and my God it is just so refreshing to see Isekai denizens just acting like normal people and not braindead idiots who can't figure out basic technology or are stuck in a medieval stasis.But really, the true star of the show is the MC, Ninomiya. He is basically Kamina in every aspect from his voice, his attitude, and even his hair. He is incredibly charismatic but not entirely infallible. Part of MBC's success is that it doles out moments of triumphs and failure to Ninomiya at a perfect pace so that he never truly succeeds in any given venture/scam but is always ready to bounce back with another crazy scheme that will once again invariably blow up in his face, sometimes for really mundane and realistic reasons (like getting busted by the company's Health Inspection for lacing lousy potions with confusion grass). He is a complete jackass with no redeeming factors, and I do love how the show sets up a bait-and-switch that almost makes you think they're gonna do the thing where he's not really a jerk and is really looking out for his friends or whatever. And that is just the best. You root for him to succeed AND fail in his mad schemes at the same time, and that really makes you bond with the character so much more.The rest of the cast also fare incredibly well too, being great foils to Ninomiya's personality in many different ways. I do think Sky and Rim (hah) are lacking in terms of character, especially in their spotlight episode, but for what it's worth they are cute and don't interfere too much with the overall show.The comedy is fantastic. A lot of it is very work-related humor with a good balance of fantasy humor, but taken to the extreme. It's largely based on what would happen if you have an exploitative conglomerate operating in Isekailand.

Well allow me to present something different™.Dungeon of Black Company is isekai done right. We follow Ninomiya Kinji, a shut-in NEET (wait, wait, don't click off) who got everything he could ever want and used the rules of our world to his advantage to become filthy rich. I don't need to do anything anymore kind of rich.Now let's take someone who got everything, and take it all from him, transporting him in a fantasy world at the beginning of the industrial era.This...concept isn't too far-fetched and yet stays fresh enough to get you interested. After all, the same old medieval fantasy world can only last so long before it gets stale.In this world in industrial expansion where human rights haven't been invented yet, the chances to get promoted are rather slim, and this is where our protagonist will show off his skill.After all, physical power, while flashy, is still an overused aspect of not only isekai, or anime, but entertainment as a whole. Instead, Ninomiya's main aspect is his lack of morals, matching that of the company itself, and his ability to find the good people and use them to the best of his abilities, which is a new kind of overpowered, making it feel rather nice.Enough praises about Ninomiya, even though he's a king beyond what the human mind can appreciate. What about the rest? Is it the same old dead and beaten harem with a bunch of hot girls head over heels for him for no apparent reason?No, Ninomiya is an asshole, remember? Well there is one who gets the uwu blushy wushy kinda thing, but it doesn't go any further. And to make up for it, there's a based ant waifu, and Wanibe, who's also really solid.And it is actually an isekai where the side characters can be summarized with more than a single sentence, to its credit, not many put that kind of effort.Furthermore, Ninomiya, despite being a main character, may not even be overpowered. After all, he spent a large portion of these 12 episodes struggling against the much superior Raiza'ha, and has been put in some bad situations, even failed a few time. How many isekai protagonists have failed in the runtime of their anime? That's what I thought.If there was one thing I'd bash this anime for, it would be Rim's... everything. No hate on her design, just like everyone else, she looks unique, but it's still palatable. The problem is that... well, she appears in episode 1, she's overpowered and she never openly opposes Ninomiya, which makes her the substitute for an overpowered main character, and makes Ninomiya's challenge a lot easier than what it could have been. All in all, she's more of a lazy plot device than a character, and it is a bit sad.But still, this anime isn't any less of a crazy ride, and is probably one of, if not my favorite anime of the season concept isn't too far-fetched and yet stays fresh enough to get you interested.

When I started watching it, I liked the different approach to the isekai genre. I thought that was just it. The first few episodes didn't catch my attention that much, but I kept watching.The anime delivered some good surprises mid way. That's where I felt the anime really kick off. At first, it was the story of a man vs an entire greedy conglomerate, and the outlook looked simple at first. However, the author of the manga really knows how to spice up the story,...and the producers did a phenomenal job in adapting it.With each new episode, I grew to love this show even more. At first, I was deciding between giving it a 7/10 or 8/10, but by the time I finished the last episode, I gave it a rating of 10/10. The last episode this season was so emotional, and if a second season came by, the nostalgia would show itself then.To me, it seems like the show grows along with the MC; at first, Ninomiya is just another person trying to get back on his feet, so to speak, after he gets isekai'd. However, with each passing episode, Ninomiya shows true talent and hard work *ahem *cough cough), which makes not only him grow as a character, but all those around him.Really looking forward to a second season for this one. and the producers did a phenomenal job in adapting it.With each new episode, I grew to love this show even more.

The main driving force that keeps the world’s engine running as society drives itself into the ground for the sake of making a quick buck at the cost of both its workers who make pitiful wages and the environment who suffers long-term damage as a result of our glorious industrial and globalization age. Too much? Well if this show wasn’t something of a meta-commentary itself, I wouldn’t be making an existential crisis opening paragraph now would I?Story:Kinji Ninomiya is a self-made man who at the ripe age of 25 has managed to create a small real estate empire powerful enough to be self-sustaining...and give him the dream that many people who work want to achieve: to not have to work. But because this is an isekai series, a random hole opens up in the ground and he’s unfortunately sucked into a fantasy world where society has moved past medieval adventurers defeating the Dark Lord, and towards a form of modern industrialism where he works as the lowest rung on the ladder in a mining company meant to make quotas for an even larger corporation that fully intends to take over the world through the most effective means we have available: by monopolizing the market and enslaving the population through economic means. Ninomiya’s goal? To reclaim the kind of influence that he had before in this new world and do what the corporations are trying to do before them.And if that didn’t sell you on the idea that this series is actually a gag isekai that commentates on the social structure of our capitalist society and how it squeezes out every drop of both the lives and wallets of the consuming working class, then I don’t know what else will. Meikyuu Black Company practically only has one theme/joke that it’s going to talk about, and that’s jokes about how everything will always lead back to money and capitalism. And that corporations will exploit you through any means necessary. It’s a very heavy-handed theme and the amount of subtlety this show has about it is about as subtle as the wage disparity between a billionaire CEO and a white collar worker. Which is something you’d think the show gets kind of stale on because the existential dread of a capitalist society can only be told so many times, but surprisingly enough the worldbuilding carries it pretty well. Throughout the twelve episode run, you get to see many different ways corporations fuck people over, whether that be because of debt loans, damage costs, or corporate buyouts, while simultaneously watching Ninomiya attempt to build success up in a similarly cutthroat way with similar yet different tactics that create what we in the market like to call ‘competition’.Which honestly when it comes to this aspect of the story, is surprisingly well done despite the leaps of logic and numerous timeskips in order to both save time and skip over the boring parts of building infrastructure and connections with other groups or companies. As for the actual story though…that’s where things start to fall apart a little bit.Because the entire show is built on Ninomiya’s schemes, the show has a pretty cut and dry formula of storytelling where Ninomiya gets an idea, executes on it, and it can either succeed or fail before the next scheme is done. It’s not a very compelling story formula because it gets kind of samey with time, and watching the guy maniacally laugh at his new get rich quick scheme gets dull since it’s happened a multitude of times before. Not only that, but in spite of the worldbuilding being mostly solid on account of the show revealing how different parts of this corporate isekai world functions, it also has a problem with revealing or showing off things and then not really building up on them. Whenever the show skips over infrastructure building in a sometimes mystery amount of time passing, the show the does a coin flip on whether or not Ninomiya wins or loses. In either scenario, a lot of what was built prior just kind of disappears from the series, and it’s not great cause in a way it feels like nothing has consequences and expected consequences like being financially destitute don’t really occur. On top of that, the show kind of switches genre halfway through which, while making sense in context, still feels wonky and not really a great mesh with the rest of the vibe that the show went for.In the end, Meikyuu Black Company is a mostly repetitive story that’s held together by the societal concept that brings us all together: money. The show honestly doesn’t have that many redeeming qualities beyond just constantly making commentary at how corporations aren’t your friend and that worker exploitation is the norm. But for what it’s worth, the show does that part of the story really, really good. It’s a shame the story doesn’t have much else to offer beyond that, but I guess you gotta stick to your isekai gimmick, eh?Characters:Ruthless, cutthroat, narcissistic with just a hint of god/superiority complex. Yep, that’s Ninomiya. I mean that’s just him in a nutshell, and not much really changes in him as a character. Due to a combination of ego and the drive to excel in business, Ninomiya is one of the most active protagonists in an isekai story that I’ve ever seen, and he gets a lot of credit from me for being an active player in the story rather than being given the keys to destiny. His anti-hero like qualities certainly don’t detract from that either as everything he does is selfish to the core with only a few minor stints in compassion and empathy on the rare occasion he tries to help someone other than himself. Unfortunately this all means that he’s quite a shallow character as well. Oddly enough, Ninomiya relies on the rest of the main cast in order to bring him down from his lofty pedestal since he doesn’t have many character qualities aside from being a dickhead fueled by money, power, and spite. He’s interesting sure, but on his own, he’s a roof without any supporting columns.The two members of his party that I want to focus on are Rim and Wanibe, the two starting characters he gets in the first episode of the show who provide very contrasting parts for his character. Whereas Ninomiya has lofty and eccentric goals, Wanibe is more grounded, desiring only stability and often questions Ninomiya’s character as a result of watching Ninomiya practice his villain laugh on more than a few occasions. He’s a great contrast for his compatriot, and provides a key secondary perspective that the show desperately needs. Rim on the other hand is either a deus ex machina or a handicap depending on the scene context, as she’s not only the dungeon’s strongest monster, but is also gluttonous to the point of actively sabotaging Ninomiya in order to sustain her appetite. There’s a neat bit of character development for her later on in the series, but it’s neither enough to separate her from the ‘hungry child’ trope nor is it enough to develop her in a significantly meaningful way.Shia and Ranga are the last two additions to the party who really don’t have that much involvement in the series beyond being the token pair of tits and the token surprise that I guess every isekai needs to some extent. Yes there’s some character to them, but the wasted potential that they ended up having feels like the show just wanted to fill up the party but didn’t want to do anything beyond stock tropes in order to save costs and brainpower, so we’re stuck with these two. Shia honestly could’ve been more than she actually ended up being and that’s a shame cause the series ended up both not needing what she was offering as a character and forced the scraps of a romantic subplot on her that really didn’t need to be a thing; stop forcing romantic subplots onto characters that don’t need them.Side characters are an interesting group, as they consist of corporate overlords, a few dungeon monsters, a few adventurers, a few NPCs, a lot of corporate workers, and whatever the hell that gun is supposed to be. They’re mostly just parts of the worldbuilding, and while yes the antagonistic force is omniprevalent in the series, they’re mostly a passive part of the series until the very last part of the show where they also don’t do anything. Which I guess makes sense since those at the top would do anything to make sure that they don’t need to take an active part of the whole process, i.e. the entire story.Aesthetics:Silver Link certainly didn’t…pull their a-game this time, so there’s not really a lot I can really say about how Meikyuu Black Company looks. The action and effects aren’t really the best, and the overall look of the show is, while stylized, not all that impressive to look at. The few upsides I will give the show are in its closeups department because to a certain extent, it feels like you can see every one of Ninomiya’s pores with how often they do closeups of the guy’s face. It’s objectively ugly the way they frame him, and it’s something that helps sell that ‘he’s honestly more of a bad guy’ vibe that he has throughout the whole show.Aside from that, the show employs a few instances of 3D models, present especially in the dungeon ants, as well as a surprising amount of equal opportunity fanservice given how not are the female characters stripped down to their bare essentials (because I guess that’s a required thing for the plot), Ninomiya and the rest of the guys get the same treatment too. The only real qualm I have about the art is the way the mouths are drawn cause they’re drawn in this downward pointing triangle style that looks a bit awkward and too sharp for my liking. Definitely a stylistic choice (like how they do the hair shine on Shia), but is definitely not one of the more appealing aspects of the art I feel.HOWL BE QUIET’s “Shimi” is a song that while has a unique hook, isn’t particularly something that I’m too attached to as a song. It certainly has some memorability to it due to its guitar riffs and vocals, but aside from that doesn’t really stand out I feel. Certainly fits for the vibe of the series to a certain extent, and for that I feel like it’s a net positive. On the flipside, Humbreaders’s “World is Mine” isn’t really that interesting to me and just kind of sounds like a generic ending song. A point that’s not helped by the fact that the latter half of the series uses a 3D model of Rim and her sister as dancing models instead of the first half’s stylistic drawing of all of the main party members in a jeep. It’s a downgrade in visuals for sure, and while I don’t think the song is bad, I don’t think it’s memorable enough to get anything more than passing marks.Final Thoughts:Given how every isekai these days has to have a gimmick whether or not that be the protagonist being remade into an NPC, the protagonist being reborn as a baby, the protagonist being reborn as a hot spring, or the protagonist bringing his mom to his fantasy world, at some point we were going to reach a breaking point where the protagonist gets brought to a world where the economic system is scarily reminiscent of his own society with all of the practices, malpractices, and customs understood in the market system. Which I guess could be considered a natural evolution, but I feel like that’s more like digimon rules than pokemon rules if we’re arguing semantics.For what its worth, I found the capitalist side of things a lot funnier than it had any right to be, and the show does not pull any punches in that regard. Every episode partakes in some kind of company malpractice with unionization, competition, and pulling bullshit out of your ass as the main reasons why this plot seems to go somewhere. It’s fun seeing how much the show pokes at our obviously dystopian and economy-fueled society but that’s about as much as the show really offers. In the end, Ninomiya is just the mouthpiece that drives the show forward, and all of his schemes either end up being success stories that don’t really last all that long, or failures that he moves on from with very little consequence. The gimmick/joke of the show is pretty much the main reason to watch the show, and while I don’t see that as a bad thing, there’s not really anything else compelling about the show and I’m a little sad the show is so one-note.Still, it’s a recommendation if you want to laugh and then have an existential crisis over the state of our society and how it’s really run. I’d file this one as a fun watch/fun experience without expecting too much more out of it aside from that. A bit more than what was presented would be nice, but given the current isekai market and how isekai with gimmicks are a dime a dozen and have a turnover rate substantial enough to make a quick buck time and time again before discarding the old for the new, I think it’s safe to say that we weren’t really gonna be getting anything more than what was shown on the box. Aw well. I wonder if there were any Japanese salarymen who laughed while watching this show before crying in existential dread because of how close it hits to home given their life situation of endless work and labor for a wage. That’d be a nice statistic to see. and give him the dream that many people who work want to achieve: to not have to work. But because this is an isekai series, a random hole opens up in the ground and he’s unfortunately sucked into a fantasy world where society has moved past medieval adventurers defeating the Dark Lord, and towards a form of modern industrialism where he works as the lowest rung on the ladder in a mining company meant to make quotas for an even larger corporation that fully intends to take over the world through the most effective means we have available: by monopolizing the market and enslaving the population through economic means. Ninomiya’s goal? To reclaim the kind of influence that he had before in this new world and do what the corporations are trying to do before them.And if that didn’t sell you on the idea that this series is actually a gag isekai that commentates on the social structure of our capitalist society and how it squeezes out every drop of both the lives and wallets of the consuming working class, then I don’t know what else will. Meikyuu Black Company practically only has one theme/joke that it’s going to talk about, and that’s jokes about how everything will always lead back to money and capitalism. And that corporations will exploit you through any means necessary. It’s a very heavy-handed theme and the amount of subtlety this show has about it is about as subtle as the wage disparity between a billionaire CEO and a white collar worker. Which is something you’d think the show gets kind of stale on because the existential dread of a capitalist society can only be told so many times, but surprisingly enough the worldbuilding carries it pretty well. Throughout the twelve episode run, you get to see many different ways corporations fuck people over, whether that be because of debt loans, damage costs, or corporate buyouts, while simultaneously watching Ninomiya attempt to build success up in a similarly cutthroat way with similar yet different tactics that create what we in the market like to call ‘competition’.Which honestly when it comes to this aspect of the story, is surprisingly well done despite the leaps of logic and numerous timeskips in order to both save time and skip over the boring parts of building infrastructure and connections with other groups or companies. As for the actual story though…that’s where things start to fall apart a little bit.Because the entire show is built on Ninomiya’s schemes, the show has a pretty cut and dry formula of storytelling where Ninomiya gets an idea, executes on it, and it can either succeed or fail before the next scheme is done. It’s not a very compelling story formula because it gets kind of samey with time, and watching the guy maniacally laugh at his new get rich quick scheme gets dull since it’s happened a multitude of times before. Not only that, but in spite of the worldbuilding being mostly solid on account of the show revealing how different parts of this corporate isekai world functions, it also has a problem with revealing or showing off things and then not really building up on them. Whenever the show skips over infrastructure building in a sometimes mystery amount of time passing, the show the does a coin flip on whether or not Ninomiya wins or loses. In either scenario, a lot of what was built prior just kind of disappears from the series, and it’s not great cause in a way it feels like nothing has consequences and expected consequences like being financially destitute don’t really occur. On top of that, the show kind of switches genre halfway through which, while making sense in context, still feels wonky and not really a great mesh with the rest of the vibe that the show went for.In the end, Meikyuu Black Company is a mostly repetitive story that’s held together by the societal concept that brings us all together: money. The show honestly doesn’t have that many redeeming qualities beyond just constantly making commentary at how corporations aren’t your friend and that worker exploitation is the norm. But for what it’s worth, the show does that part of the story really, really good. It’s a shame the story doesn’t have much else to offer beyond that, but I guess you gotta stick to your isekai gimmick, eh?Characters:Ruthless, cutthroat, narcissistic with just a hint of god/superiority complex. Yep, that’s Ninomiya. I mean that’s just him in a nutshell, and not much really changes in him as a character. Due to a combination of ego and the drive to excel in business, Ninomiya is one of the most active protagonists in an isekai story that I’ve ever seen, and he gets a lot of credit from me for being an active player in the story rather than being given the keys to destiny. His anti-hero like qualities certainly don’t detract from that either as everything he does is selfish to the core with only a few minor stints in compassion and empathy on the rare occasion he tries to help someone other than himself. Unfortunately this all means that he’s quite a shallow character as well. Oddly enough, Ninomiya relies on the rest of the main cast in order to bring him down from his lofty pedestal since he doesn’t have many character qualities aside from being a dickhead fueled by money, power, and spite. He’s interesting sure, but on his own, he’s a roof without any supporting columns.The two members of his party that I want to focus on are Rim and Wanibe, the two starting characters he gets in the first episode of the show who provide very contrasting parts for his character. Whereas Ninomiya has lofty and eccentric goals, Wanibe is more grounded, desiring only stability and often questions Ninomiya’s character as a result of watching Ninomiya practice his villain laugh on more than a few occasions. He’s a great contrast for his compatriot, and provides a key secondary perspective that the show desperately needs. Rim on the other hand is either a deus ex machina or a handicap depending on the scene context, as she’s not only the dungeon’s strongest monster, but is also gluttonous to the point of actively sabotaging Ninomiya in order to sustain her appetite. There’s a neat bit of character development for her later on in the series, but it’s neither enough to separate her from the ‘hungry child’ trope nor is it enough to develop her in a significantly meaningful way.Shia and Ranga are the last two additions to the party who really don’t have that much involvement in the series beyond being the token pair of tits and the token surprise that I guess every isekai needs to some extent. Yes there’s some character to them, but the wasted potential that they ended up having feels like the show just wanted to fill up the party but didn’t want to do anything beyond stock tropes in order to save costs and brainpower, so we’re stuck with these two. Shia honestly could’ve been more than she actually ended up being and that’s a shame cause the series ended up both not needing what she was offering as a character and forced the scraps of a romantic subplot on her that really didn’t need to be a thing; stop forcing romantic subplots onto characters that don’t need them.Side characters are an interesting group, as they consist of corporate overlords, a few dungeon monsters, a few adventurers, a few NPCs, a lot of corporate workers, and whatever the hell that gun is supposed to be. They’re mostly just parts of the worldbuilding, and while yes the antagonistic force is omniprevalent in the series, they’re mostly a passive part of the series until the very last part of the show where they also don’t do anything. Which I guess makes sense since those at the top would do anything to make sure that they don’t need to take an active part of the whole process, i.e. the entire story.Aesthetics:Silver Link certainly didn’t…pull their a-game this time, so there’s not really a lot I can really say about how Meikyuu Black Company looks. The action and effects aren’t really the best, and the overall look of the show is, while stylized, not all that impressive to look at. The few upsides I will give the show are in its closeups department because to a certain extent, it feels like you can see every one of Ninomiya’s pores with how often they do closeups of the guy’s face. It’s objectively ugly the way they frame him, and it’s something that helps sell that ‘he’s honestly more of a bad guy’ vibe that he has throughout the whole show.Aside from that, the show employs a few instances of 3D models, present especially in the dungeon ants, as well as a surprising amount of equal opportunity fanservice given how not are the female characters stripped down to their bare essentials (because I guess that’s a required thing for the plot), Ninomiya and the rest of the guys get the same treatment too. The only real qualm I have about the art is the way the mouths are drawn cause they’re drawn in this downward pointing triangle style that looks a bit awkward and too sharp for my liking.

I'd advise giving it a shot honestly!"", 'The isekai genre is pretty much unanimously notorious -- notorious for mass-producing wholly lifeless shows that are barred from any semblance of creativity whatsoever. A large part of the anime community is openly critical of the genre for this reason, but despite its notoriety, the popularity of isekai is still as high as ever. More than half a dozen isekai shows are shoved down our throat nearly every season, and the ongoing summer is not an exception. Meikyuu Black Company isn\'t very different from your typical isekai anime in this regard, but surprisingly, it is one of the few ones out there that barely suffer...because of that.When people think of a comedy isekai, parodies like KonoSuba usually come to mind because of their overblown popularity over the recent years. Surprisingly though, Meikyuu is not necessarily a parody anime. It is primarily a typical (""typical"" in the sense that it is not isekai) comedy show that provides a fairly interesting and satirical take on capitalism. Though Meikyuu is not a parody of isekai, however, it is indeed aware of the genre\'s usual trappings and sometimes cleverly uses them for comedy, which already sort of makes the show a breath of fresh air to be honest.Coming back to the pivotal theme of the series, Meikyuu satirizes the capitalist mindset in rather bizarre and exaggerated ways, but in doing so, it also delivers a somewhat well-written critique of the system. Of course, the portrayal of capitalism here isn\'t exactly what you would call serious or akin to reality, but there\'s always an underlying sense of truth that remains underneath the seemingly light-hearted comedy. I don\'t mean that Meikyuu is a serious show by any measure, but when it does attempt to be profound (kind of), it surprisingly succeeds to a considerable extent. And the person who makes it all work is the protagonist, Kinji Ninomiya.Ninomiya is by far the most intriguing character in Meikyuu; he is arguably the very thing that makes the anime so entertaining and sets it apart from other isekai series. What makes Ninomiya himself so entertaining is his severe contrast with the multitude of isekai protagonists out there. Ninomiya can be fairly dumb, selfish, cynical and manipulative at times, but he is also unexpectedly clever and thoughtful. His actions and beliefs are undoubtedly questionable sometimes, but they don\'t affect the likeability of his character (there are a few exceptions, like that one time when he grabbed Shia\'s chest for no reason).To be more specific, Ninomiya\'s unwillingness to give in to his shitty circumstances is what makes him compelling. There are several times in the show where Ninomiya is driven to a corner, but he always manages to get on top of the situation through his over-the-top plotting. Luck hasn\'t exactly been on his side since he was isekaied to another world, and it doesn\'t seem like it will be anytime soon either, but one\'s thing for sure --Ninomiya will continue to fight against his predicaments no matter what it takes; he is not going to give up easily. Again, that is precisely what makes him such a compelling character.Unfortunately, in a way, that also makes Ninomiya the biggest weakness of Meikyuu -- I will explain how.Ninomiya is clearly the singular main character of the story, and while that\'s not necessarily always a bad thing in of itself, the anime sometimes relies on him so much to the point that other characters are treated as tools who are merely created to be foils to Ninomiya and move the story forward. Even when someone else eventually takes the spotlight, they always fail to leave any significant impression, since it doesn\'t take a long time before they are reduced to a static background character again.Despite these glaring issues, though, the characters don\'t fail to be entertaining for the most part. Wanibe is a likeable guy despite his naive nature, Shia is an encouraging women with her determination, and Renga is adorable though his depiction in the anime is occasionally very questionable (especially in that bath scene). Of course, there\'s Rim as well, whose insatiable hunger and childish behavior creates some hilarious moments in the anime. All in all, Rim is generally a very entertaining character -- even despite her apparent clothing issues. I mean, surely it wouldn\'t have hurt anyone if you hadn\'t made her a loli or, you know, at least given her some proper clothes?Another one of Meikyuu\'s most noticeable flaws is that pacing is occasionally very poorly handled. Sometimes, the story moves forward in an abruptly fast pace and escalates way too quickly for its own good. The final arc of the show is the easily the most guilty of this. In particular, the last two episodes were rather difficult to follow because of the sudden and abrupt progression of events. Honestly, the entirety of the arc felt quite rushed, although I did enjoy it in the end.In terms of production, there is not much to talk about Meikyuu to be honest. Don\'t get me wrong, though -- it is not a badly produced show by any means. The animation is fairly decent and the soundtrack isn\'t half bad either. The opening song seriously slaps by the way. It is one of the catchiest theme songs this season (or even this entire year) and by far the most underrated one. The ending song is also quite good in my opinion.Despite my initial qualms, Meikyuu Black Company ultimately proved to be a simple yet nonetheless enjoyable isekai anime. It doesn\'t bring anything particularly innovative to the table per se, but if what you want is simply an isekai anime that doesn\'t cover itself with superfluous drama and actually tries to make its audience laugh, then this show won\'t disappoint you. Especially in a period where isekai has become almost entirely devoid of flair, Meikyuu is, without a doubt, more than a welcome addition to the genre. because of that.When people think of a comedy isekai, parodies like KonoSuba usually come to mind because of their overblown popularity over the recent years.

The humour actually similar to Konosuba and Gintama for this reason I really love this show. Extraordinary story, unpredictable choices of the character which are really funny since there are a lot of similar problems we can relate to our real life.THis show isn\'t about some ""extraordinary art"", ""amazing battles"", ""music"". This show...has a great original story which is funny and amazing for this reason it creates a good entertainment for viewers. Please, try it and you will have a blast. has a great original story which is funny and amazing for this reason it creates a good entertainment for viewers. Please, try it and you will have a blast.', '--NO MAJOR SPOILERS--Meikyuu Black Company is a hard show to exactly rank. Despite falling into some typical isekai pitfalls and execution of tropes, it stands out at as a rather fresh show nonetheless. The show satirizes terrible working conditions and problems of a capitalistic system to such an extreme level, it both gives great commentary on it, while being surreal and wacky enough to be genuinely funny. One ep we’re having the mc blackmail the main hero of the company abusing their employees to work on him, the next we’re having him sucked into the far future only to have to back in time to...stop said evil company from causing an oppressive mecha force to cause the already post-apocalyptic world to go into even worse turmoil. No I couldn’t make that up if even if I wanted too.--STORY—MBC’s story is honestly hard to describe. There is an overall end goal here with pretty blatant themes, but it gets there in the most unpredictable and weird way. At times it feels like they’re mashing just a ton of crap together, and yet it honestly works. I would say the main cycle is Ninomiya becoming successful with some get rich quick scheme, only for it to inevitably fall apart, but even that doesn’t really properly do it justice. I wouldn’t exactly call MBC a twist heavy show, but it will probably surprise in you in the direction it goes. The comedy is good overall, and while some jokes are again typical isekai/anime humor, there’s also a lot of funny and well done jokes too.--CHARACTERS—Probably the main highlight of this show for me is Ninomiya overall. He starts off as a scumbag and more or less is still one by the end, but he does show some great growth. He does genuinely care for his allies, will go out of his way to solve problems, and even eventually incorporates ethical and fair working conditions. I would say he’s still ultimately a self-centered person and often he has some ulterior motive to helping others and usually manipulates them, but there’s a few times where he could’ve taken the easy way out and didn’t and that’s pretty respectable. Regardless of how shady or selfish his motives and methods can be, he’s absolutely the most hard working and determined NEET you’ll meet and it makes for a good dynamic. He gets more than his fair share of punishment for being a douche at times, so when he is finally rewarded and in a better position it feels more or less earned compared to a lot of isekai protags.Side cast is fairly typical isekai stuff, but they work well enough. Belza and her company from Hell works well enough as an antag too, but don’t expect anything crazy.--ART/ANIMATION—Animation is pretty consistently good, I didn’t really notice any eps that were badly animated. There’s not too much cgi, and when there is it doesn’t really feel distracting or out of place. Ninomiya has a good design, but sometimes the girls felt like they fell into “sameface” a bit. Mostly the eyes and lips would often seem really similar. I would like to point out the 2nd ED is very cute and well animated for being 3D.--SOUND—Voice cast is quite nice, Katsuyuki Konishi does a great job having a near comically evil voice for Ninomiya, and you love to hear him do his performance. Misaki Kuno’s performance as Rimu is also very cute and funny, she voices all her antics quite well. The rest of the cast is good too.Music is actually pretty consistently catchy. The OP and ED in particular are very good, and the general soundtrack has some good metal, atmospheric, and chill music overall.--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION—7.5/10 show overall. Definitely one of the fresher isekai to come out, and I’d rec it if you’re looking for something a bit different in the genre. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and wouldn’t mind watching a sequel season to it.

Work exploitation themes are probably not going to make laugh a typical 13 years old audience, but for those who can relate there's plenty to enjoy in this show.Instead of a loser bland MC that gets a harem just by breathing, here you get a character with questionable work ethics trying to rise in a capitalist savage world.You can almost tell the author has seen some serious stuff as you most likely can't write such on-point satire without having experienced it closely yourself.Animation itself is nice, the characters have funny personalities and the voice actors did an awesome job, Wanibe in...particular was great.Both the opening and ending sonds are absolute bangers. The ending lyrics fit almost perfectly the story.

It's not about fighting or having the MC be some overpowered hero type. Honestly, you can learn a little about how economics work and be entertained by the theatrics of this show. The MC seems like some selfish prick but it's totally called for and with good reason. The business world translates well since it's not something we usually see in connection with a fantasy world. On top of that, this show is hilarious at times. It's a good hit, however I can see a certain amount of viewers being bored with the exposition of...the MC and his theatrics of monologuing about business practices. It's definitely something worth watching but with a grain of salt since this isn't your typical Isekai anime. The MC isn't a hero and he doesn't desire to be, and that's fine.

It is basically a fool\'s dream, turned out pretty miserable at first but mishap lags behind. Each moment of the animation is filled up with new idea as soon as the fall of past plans. Fairly sum of business artistry in isekai world. Largely it is expected, Isekai stories are full of harems and hero based  story, where the main character is about develop through out the events; that concept doesn\'t apply to this one.

I purchased the blu-ray for this without ever having heard of it previously because its Limited Edition was available at a steep discount. Now having actually watched it, it really wasn\'t too bad at all. Reviewing comedy anime in particular is challenging because humor is so personal and subjective and what might have one person rolling on the floor choking on their laughter may not even amuse another, or hell it may even outright annoy them. My subjective reaction to the humor in this particular anime is that it was inoffensive and occasionally worthy...of a chuckle or a snicker but the vast majority of the jokes didn\'t land for me or draw any kind of reaction from me. They\'re likely targeted at an audience younger than I am.That said, while the humor was forgettable for me, I feel there were several other aspects of the show worthy of praise. As a whole this show felt fairly unique and different, which was an ultra welcome and breath of fresh air in a time where everything reminds me to varying degrees of something else that I\'ve already seen, and that uniqueness is perfects the strongest aspect of the program. For starters our main character is not the generically nice, bland looking, high school aged guy with very little personality beyond being nice that we\'ve all seen ad nauseum. Instead, our main character here is a full grown adult, is noticeably very fit, has considerably longer hair than most male leads and a distinctive ponytail and, most importantly, he\'s a full on self-serving jerk with no redeeming qualities. The show has plenty of opportunities for him to show a soft side or a heart in there somewhere and do something for someone else\'s sake, but he never does. ALL his actions are for his own benefit and I believe the show is better and more exciting for it.Another aspect of the show I found to be different from the norm in a positive way is the soundtrack. It had a much more rock and roll/metal sound going on with lots of volume and attitude and a predominantly heard electric guitar, which again is unlike most other anime and stands out. The music absolutely got me playing air guitar and using my wife\'s legs as drums as we watched from our couch.The plot itself, while not absolutely 100% original, which is almost impossible to do these days, again felt more different than same. It\'s got isekai elements and comedy elements but it\'s different enough from the norms in either of these genres to really stand out on its own. Ultimately the big baddy in this anime isn\'t the badass monster at the bottom of the dungeon nor is it the rival character you encounter early on that is unfathomably stronger than you are. There is an ""evil"" corporation, yes, but ultimately the bad guy in the show is capitalism itself. It should be noted that this show does not take itself seriously at all and is very self-aware of its tone, which it needs to be because this plot wouldn\'t work if they asked us to take it at face value.Objectively this show is probably a bit better than the final score I ultimately landed on, but subjective things took away a couple points for me. Like I said previously, the humor largely missed for me and was forgettable. Additionally, while this show was never BAD or BORING per say, it also wasn\'t ever exciting or overly engaging. There aren\'t any dramatic moments or meaningful twists and it certainly never makes you think. You can watch this with your mind 100% turned off and you won\'t miss anything. 12 episodes was likely the correct runtime for this. If we\'d started pushing 16, 20, 24 I think I would have started to get bored. I largely felt along for the ride rather than actively engaged.The other negative I\'d point out, which is inherent with a large cast and short runtime, is the clear lack of character development. They simply don\'t have the time to do this within the confines of the episode count, but there\'s no arguing that the characters here are flat and one-dimensional. One character that\'s met early on could be almost entirely summed up as ""Overpowered, obsessed with food"" and there really truly isn\'t much more to her than that. Almost every other character could be summed up in a similar way.Ultimately I liked The Dungeon of Black Company a lot more than I disliked it and I\'d surely watch a second season if that ever becomes a thing. It\'s not amazing by any means and beyond being fairly unique it won\'t be overly memorable to me, but it\'s a ride I don\'t regret taking. I won\'t go so far as to actively recommend it because comedy is so hit or miss person to person, but I don\'t think most people would be miserable watching this even if the humor doesn\'t land for them and if the humor DOES land for that person you might enjoy this a lot.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5~PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7 of a chuckle or a snicker but the vast majority of the jokes didn\'t land for me or draw any kind of reaction from me.

It flips between being funny and being boring, so whether you like it or not will depend on your level of tolerance for that kind of inconsistency.Story: Meikyuu Black Company is a story about a rich asshole by the name of Ninomiya getting zapped into a fantasy world, where he immediately goes deep into debt in their society of predatory ultra-capitalism and is forced to work as something like an indentured servant.  This sounds like the setup for an excellent satire of Japanese work culture and capitalism more broadly, but it never quite gets there.  As...a story, it seems unfocused and unsure of what it\'s trying to be.  Ninomiya himself is the biggest issue here, as the show seems unsure of whether he\'s good or bad, and if his actions are worthy of praise or condemnation.  He treats his friends like shit, but they all seem to like him.  He does some pretty indefensible things, like mind controlling his coworkers to work extra hard so he can relax, but he\'s often treated like a hero in spite of his narcissistic sociopathy.  The message of the series is very muddled as a result.  Is Ninomiya\'s ""the strong should dominate the weak"" ethos the message of the series, or a satire of it?  The show doesn\'t seem to know, and that thematic inconsistency really takes the wind out of its sails.Audio/Visual: A strong performance by Konishi Katsuyuki in the lead role of Ninomiya here, his comically over the top voicing of the character fits like a glove.  Most of the other VAs are just there, but I also want to call attention to the collection of sound effects that I\'ve termed ""Rim noises"", usually involving her eating or doing something distracting in the background of a scene.  They\'re a small thing, but always entertaining and used well.  Visually, well, this show just looks bad.  The character designs are poor, faces are too pointy and too samey, often just looking like they swapped hair colors and styles on the same body and face for a new character.  The animation is unimpressive as well.  They undoubtedly did the best they could with the budget, but the result is not very good.Characters: Without repeating everything I said about Ninomiya above, he\'s both the biggest strength and biggest weakness of the series.  Those issues aside, he\'s usually the funniest character in the series, and you alternate between wanting to see him win and wanting to see him get owned by his own selfish behavior.  This is not a strength from a storytelling perspective, but it means there are plenty of opportunities for comedy, and he can play both the straight man and the butt of the joke when the situation calls for it.  Most of the other characters are just okay, the later addition of Ranga is notably cringeworthy however.  That said, the food-obsessed dragon girl Rim often makes this series worth watching singlehandedly.  She\'s cute and funny and almost always steals whatever scene she\'s in.  The problem is that she\'s often in the background and not the focus of that particular scene, so her background antics prove distracting for whatever you\'re supposed to be paying attention to.  In the end though, that probably says more about the lack of appeal that the other characters have by comparison. a story, it seems unfocused and unsure of what it\'s trying to be.

That said, the food-obsessed dragon girl Rim often makes this series worth watching singlehandedly.  She\'s cute and funny and almost always steals whatever scene she\'s in.  The problem is that she\'s often in the background and not the focus of that particular scene, so her background antics prove distracting for whatever you\'re supposed to be paying attention to.  In the end though, that probably says more about the lack of appeal that the other characters have by comparison.', 'I\'ve watched all the available episodes (5).In short - this is basically Konosuba. Isekai, great comedy, main character who is weak but still manages to do stuff, great characters, great everything. Music didn\'t leave an impression, OP is decent but otherwise it was kinda unnoticable.So the main character is someone who wants to lead the NEET life, but understands the basics of economy/responsibility and worked hard his whole life (I mean maybe like 10+ years) to save money, get some hits with stocks, property and stuff and finally managed to own huge apartment buildings and live off the rent income freely, the perfect NEET lifestyle,...but while truck-kun didn\'t visit, the ""portal-kun"" did - and there starts him being pulled away from everything he worked so hard to get, into a fantasy world, with swords, magic and demi-humans, also similar levels of technology - but industrial era class systems and inhumane work conditions, and the MC will need to crawl out of that hole as a grunt, with many systems holding back people like him.While the first episode is slightly weaker than the following 4 episodes, the main character, while evil in some sense and completely selfish, he is rather likeable by the 5th episode and you\'re rooting him on, as technically while he isn\'t doing stuff that\'s completely above-board, he\'s the best of what\'s available for everyone, so he\'s kind of a evil person, who isn\'t that evil in comparison to what\'s going on in that world?The animation is solid, although it\'s not OPM, Konosuba, etc, in terms of fluidity, it\'s quite decent and does what it set out to do.I am kinda worried as the story progression feels a bit on the fast side, and the characters haven\'t been given too much development time - while we can see the characters do stuff, and the main characters are all rather fun, the pacing is a bit faster than Konosuba up until now. As we have yet to see the end, it maybe too rushed near the end, or maybe it stops focusing on the strengths of the series (the MC and him trying to get an edge in a world that\'s out to get him) I\'m currently hopeful that it will ride strong for the whole 12 episodes.This is a must watch for everyone who likes Konosuba in my opinion. While I wasn\'t too sure how good it will be, I gave it a shot and I was hooked for the whole 5 episodes that I watched in a row. but while truck-kun didn\'t visit, the ""portal-kun"" did - and there starts him being pulled away from everything he worked so hard to get, into a fantasy world, with swords, magic and demi-humans, also similar levels of technology - but industrial era class systems and inhumane work conditions, and the MC will need to crawl out of that hole as a grunt, with many systems holding back people like him.While the first episode is slightly weaker than the following 4 episodes, the main character, while evil in some sense and completely selfish, he is rather likeable by the 5th episode and you\'re rooting him on, as technically while he isn\'t doing stuff that\'s completely above-board, he\'s the best of what\'s available for everyone, so he\'s kind of a evil person, who isn\'t that evil in comparison to what\'s going on in that world?The animation is solid, although it\'s not OPM, Konosuba, etc, in terms of fluidity, it\'s quite decent and does what it set out to do.I am kinda worried as the story progression feels a bit on the fast side, and the characters haven\'t been given too much development time - while we can see the characters do stuff, and the main characters are all rather fun, the pacing is a bit faster than Konosuba up until now.

Here’s why.Devious, crafty and charismatic; funny, introspective and somewhat relatable. Kinji Ninomiya is the star of this show. Think Kazuma but with a more mature mentality - he’s not just a copy paste though, don’t be mistaken.The wide cast of characters were fun and lively, (They’ve got nearly all the types of waifus you want: mature, young but actually old, not even a girl...) but there isn’t a disgusting focus on it - it’s just there to be appreciated.SPOILERSThere are many tonal shifts throughout...the anime but it never fails to maintain he freshness, quality and most importantly, sense. Meikyuu black company changed from exploitation of workers to time travel, and the depths of the dungeon to political schemes - all while being entertaining, fun and rather refreshing.END OF SPOILERSSound and art was well done - nothing Fate/ Heaven’s Feel quality - but that’s that, this is this; the down to earthness fit the mood and atmosphere of the show well.This was a good watch and a definite stand out from the myriad isekai trash defiling our precious medium. Entertaining mc, simple but compelling plot, slight relatibilty if you work in a not so positive work environment.

The main character is motivated by a clear goal and drives the story forward. He faces an interesting variety of credible threats, from losing his life savings to losing his actual life. He's supposed to be obnoxious, and he absolutely is, and he does get punished for it, but he isn't reduced to a laughingstock or a punching bag either. I wanted to see what he would do next; I wanted him to succeed; I laughed when he screwed everything up. It's a nice balance.The pacing is excellent: it really does give you something new every episode. Action scenes are more likely to showcase creative problem-solving than generic fantasy swordplay. The characters and their relationships are fairly well developed: we get credible friends, credible siblings, credible students and mentors, credible heroes, anti-heroes, and villains, and a few gestures toward credible romance. The animation is serviceable. I prefer the English dub.In the end, I was torn between an eight and a nine. In the cold light of day, it's probably an eight, but somehow 'Black Company' just left me feeling really generous: I want to see more shows like it. Can we call it a bonus? Or overtime pay?

Working long hours at jobs they don’t particular like in order to pay for things that at best make them happy short term. However, Ninomiya Kinji was determined to escape such a life at all costs. And he did, taking crazy risks but quickly becoming rich enough to do whatever he wants as an Uber NEET. But then he got isekai’d to a fantasy world. And unfortunately the fantasy world is very...similar to ours, especially in terms of how it’s full of corporations exploiting their workers. However, just as he did in his previous life, Ninomiya is determined to become an Uber NEET in this one as well, regardless of what tricks, cheats, and lies he must use in order to do so.This anime is pretty much entirely carried by Ninomiya. He’s a difficult character to explain because he’s a both a really lame arrogant self centered NEET and a hyper competent devious boss that channels a lot of Kamina (TTGL) energy, and not just because of his voice actor. He’s certainly more the former type of character towards the beginning of the anime and more the latter towards the end, but it’s not like he has a character arc. Rather, it feels more like his difference in character is solely a result of what circumstances he’s put into. This may sound like a weakness because it means he’s written such that he doesn’t have much character growth, but I actually feel like it’s one of the anime’s greatest strengths. Because he fails miserably more than half the time, the times he succeeds and comes out looking awesome are incredibly satisfying. The times he fails are pretty funny too, though the amount of failures did get somewhat annoying. However, the failures are critical to making the successes work so well, so I can’t say I’d want them gone.The anime also has a lot of other stuff thrown in which helps add variety. None of it is especially good though. There are a lot of fun side characters that get character development, though it’s never all that deep. It touches on a lot of different aspects of the business world. It starts out with workers being exploited in the mines, but then goes all over the place with topics including corporate brainwashing, false advertising, automation, resource depletion, and business politics. All with a bit of a fantasy twist. While none of it is especially great, it keeps things interesting and helps Ninomiya shine which is the core of the anime. It also adds variety to the comedy which helps keep it amusing.The art and animation are pretty solid. The character designs I felt were mostly pretty boring though. The OP is pretty good in terms of the song and visuals. The ED’s song and the first visuals are okay. I like the second visuals though with Rim dancing. The soundtrack is decent enough but not particularly memorable. similar to ours, especially in terms of how it’s full of corporations exploiting their workers.

Yes, it's a good anime in my book.Story: So without spoiling much it's an Isekai about a guy who's good with business and will make a business out of anything just so he can live an easy an comfortable life, but often at times gets stopped from advancing.Art: The art and animation reminds me somewhat of a mix of Gurren Lagann & Konosuba. I like it.Sound: Opening and Ending are great. Music is still stuck in my head because it's catchy.Characters: Mostly Ninomiya is the most entertaining one. He reminds me alot of Kamina from Gurren Lagann in both looks...and confident attitude. Only difference is Ninomiya has a more of a darker demeanor. Some of the other characters have something that makes them unique and memorable as well. Like I like his whole crew. Though some characters that were introduced really didn't need to be introduced. They stay in for like a episode and not really seen again, but some are just there for story filler.Overall: I love this series. I can't believe it was one of the anime I didn't watch weekly as I watch alot of weekly anime, and this one escaped my grasp until it was finally done. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get some good laughs. 8.5/10 and confident attitude. Only difference is Ninomiya has a more of a darker demeanor.

It’s definitely memorable for having exploitative “black companies” as its theme since stressful work environments and long working hours are quite the issue in Japan.The series starts off with the main character, Ninomiya Kinji, getting transported to another world. As such, it’s technically an isekai series. That said, the events that unfold over the course of the series don’t make it feel like a typical isekai.Kinji has a lot more personality than many generic, faceless, ambitionless isekai main characters –...not that this makes him likeable, mind you. And while he isn’t particularly powerful by himself, he does become “overpowered” over time because of the people he gathers around him.The side characters are pretty diverse and can be charming. I was especially fond of the lizardman character Wanibe because he is a voice of reason. Unfortunately, most of the characters including Wanibe follow Kinji and more or less become his resources to be used as he pleases. I’m not against a character having followers, but there is no good reason for any of them to follow him. He practically bullies, lies and cheats his way into their hearts more than anything else. And that’s a shame, because it takes away from their agency and turns them into cardboard cutouts for the most part.The plot itself is winding, nonsensical and over-the-top. I see this as both a good and a bad thing. At the very least Meikyuu Black Company was somewhat unpredictable, and I was constantly left wondering where the story would go next. Unfortunately, things always go Kinji’s way through sheer luck, his companions doing all the hard work, or other plot reasons. So while the happenings in Meikyuu Black Company combined with its theme are novel enough, the anime lacked a certain depth.The sound effects are passable and the background music is not particularly noteworthy. The OP and ED, however, are quite catchy.The character designs are fine for the most part, and there were a few good background art shots. But the overall quality of the animation is very basic. It does what it needs to do and nothing more.Voice acting was quite good in general, both for main and side characters.Overall, I would say I enjoyed Meikyuu Black Company. I can’t quite recommend it unless you do your best to go with the flow. If you start questioning things, this series would be pretty miserable to watch. not that this makes him likeable, mind you.

Kazuma\'s personality is fundamentally a lot different from Ninomiya. While both are quite talentless at magic, their OP companions or quick thinking get them by, but the difference between them is how they conduct themselves. Kazuma\'s a lot more, well, scummy, hedonistic, and perverted, while Ninomiya is a lot more cool headed, goal focused, and as such, makes more plans. Basically, Ninomiya\'s a lot more of a ""respectable""...character than Kazuma, and the stories really can\'t be compared to each other as a result. I mean, you can measure the successfulness of Ninomiya and Kazuma right off the bat, where Ninomiya is a rich NEET chilling in his penthouse apartment, Kazuma is just a regular NEET.There definitely are times where Meikyuu Black Company falls short of the comedy that Konosuba pops out, but Meikyuu Black Company has, in my opinion, a far better overarching story and had a lot of potential with the characters and story setup. The introduction of the characters in Meikyuu Black Company seem very natural. Every character that ends up in Ninomiya\'s crew has a backstory and a good introductory arc. Sure, they might not have that much depth because of the fast paced fashion of the story, but they\'re not bad. You got the OP dragon companion, right? As much as a glutton as a monster powerhouse. A blessing and a curse. A character that can tip the scales or can be completely useless at times. When her sister gets introduced, she  even becomes a more three dimensional character. Shia\'s the typical straight laced character, but I feel like it\'s necessary when all of the other characters in Ninomiya\'s crew are pretty crazy and off the rails. Of course, you got Wanibe, again, another character that plays the straight man because he is the only non superhuman character in the crew other than Ninomiya himself. Ranga\'s the typical trap character, but he\'s alright. The ant queen was definitely the one character that was just shoved into the story without much thought. I would have hoped for a bit better of an introduction to her, but whatever.Again, these characters have a lot of potential for growth, but because of the 12 episode time window, there was not a lot of time for these character dynamics to fully flesh out, which is a shame. There are definitely times where the parts of the show drag on, but also other parts where it\'s great. It\'s a mixed bag, and with all of the random story arcs up and around, this is bound to happen, you might say.The last 2 episodes are clear filler. I haven\'t read the original source material, but it\'s quite clear that the anime just creates filler or rushes through everything to get to a ""conclusion"" of the anime that I did not think was that necessary. Overall, it just feels like a wish fulfillment because everything goes well for Ninomiya. I don\'t need to read the original manga to know that the ending is definitely filler content.Again, Meikyuu Black Company isn\'t anything amazing, and at times, it does feel like a pretty boring isekai. There was potential for bigger and better things, but inconsistent character interaction and story arc quality drag it back. Still, it was decently enjoyable. character than Kazuma, and the stories really can\'t be compared to each other as a result. I mean, you can measure the successfulness of Ninomiya and Kazuma right off the bat, where Ninomiya is a rich NEET chilling in his penthouse apartment, Kazuma is just a regular NEET.There definitely are times where Meikyuu Black Company falls short of the comedy that Konosuba pops out, but Meikyuu Black Company has, in my opinion, a far better overarching story and had a lot of potential with the characters and story setup. The introduction of the characters in Meikyuu Black Company seem very natural. Every character that ends up in Ninomiya\'s crew has a backstory and a good introductory arc. Sure, they might not have that much depth because of the fast paced fashion of the story, but they\'re not bad. You got the OP dragon companion, right? As much as a glutton as a monster powerhouse. A blessing and a curse. A character that can tip the scales or can be completely useless at times. When her sister gets introduced, she  even becomes a more three dimensional character. Shia\'s the typical straight laced character, but I feel like it\'s necessary when all of the other characters in Ninomiya\'s crew are pretty crazy and off the rails. Of course, you got Wanibe, again, another character that plays the straight man because he is the only non superhuman character in the crew other than Ninomiya himself.

Black Company is easily at the top of the isekai genre in my opinion, standing out in many ways for the better. This anime meets the extremely basic requirement that any good isekai seems to have: The story doesn\'t use the premise of isekai as a crutch for the author being unable to come up with their own complete interesting world, instead it\'s used to enrich the story and add some humorous elements to it. The main character is a...complex character; he manages to come off as a moron and as a genius through various ways, which made the story unpredictable in a good way. With the image of the main character we\'re given, the viewer is given a sense that they know him... and then that perception is flipped on its head in some way, and then the plot flows along course different from the expectation in some way; this keeps all the episodes lively and exciting. Honestly I wasn\'t sure how I\'d feel about the show after the first 2 or 3 episodes - I remember thinking ""do I want to continue to watch? I mean, it\'s been great, but... is it going to keep it up?!"" - The answer, to me, was definitely a yes. The 11th episode as well made me think something along the lines of ""oh jeez, do I really want to see the 12th episode"" / ""are they going to mess up the ending in a bad way""... the answer was also no, it was a great ending, and one that I thought fit well. In fact, not only that, but the main character had actual development and growth! On the other hand, I think the standout negatives in the show were the couple of times the main character sexually harassed other characters; both instances of it seemed out of the blue to me, and I didn\'t think fit well into the storyline. On the other hand though, the second case of it revealed information about a character\'s sex that was at least a different way to present the audience with the information - but that still doesn\'t make it better that the approach chosen was via sexual harassment. It was on that particular point that really made me think whether I should give the show a 10 instead of a 9, but I think that ultimately, I would still call it a masterpiece, despite those negative instances. complex character; he manages to come off as a moron and as a genius through various ways, which made the story unpredictable in a good way.

So I have been an anime fan for a looong time. I moved to Japan back in 2010, and ironic enough, when I did, I pretty much stopped watching anime. In the 11+ years I have been here, (till June 2020) I only saw 3-4 new series. This is coming from a person who used to watch anime like it was my job (40 hours / week).So in June 2020, a friend of mine, told me I ""HAD TO"" watch RE:ZERO. So I did, and fell hard for the isekai genre....I have seen a few series in the past, that technically count as isekai\'s (El Hazard and Twelve Kingdoms to name a few). So Basically for the past 8 months 99% of the anime shows I have seen, have all been Isekai\'s.I have seen quite a few now, some were good, some were even great, but most? Mediocre at past.The problem with most Isekai\'s is not so much the plot, but the pacing. To many things, happen too fast. Main character becomes crazy OP a minute into the first episode. Honestly I wasn\'t sure what to expect with Meikyuu Black Company.On my hunt for a new isekai anime, I am constantly going over peoples top 10, top 50, even some top 100 isekai\'s in hopes to find a gem.This series was on a complete whim, I was sure the character was just going to die somehow and get transported like the rest. I was sure he was going to be OP from the beginning. I was sure he was going to get hit on by all the female characters. I was sure it was going to be just like your average iseaki.Let me tell you, I was SO happy I was WRONG.You will see magic, and I am not talking about just in the show, I am talking about a genuinely amazing series. The main character is funny, likeable, and quite frankly a joy to watch on screen.Most of the time, I can\'t even remember a isekai\'s plot a few days after watching the series (no joke). They all start to blend together. Don\'t get me wrong, I do enjoy watching them. But, ask me what happened in the show, how it all ended, I couldn\'t tell you. But this show? I already know that I won\'t be forgetting the plot and the characters anytime soon.Now lets get into it a bit more:Story: You think it might not be original (isekai afterall) but this is some amazing stuff. Watch at least up to episode 4 and you will be impressed, hands down. Unlike most shows, when this one ends, you will feel satisfied.Art: This is the only part that they could / should have worked on to be honest. This anime came out in 2021 but the art appears from 15 years ago. It didn\'t bother me much, as the story was amazing, but I feel that if the art was better, I could have given the series a 10 / 10.Sound: They are okay, I will say that I usually don\'t listen to the OP and ED of anime shows past 1 time each. However, I really enjoy the ED song in this series. Very catchy. As far as sound during the show? nothing memorable unfortunately.Character: The main character is fantastic. He is the show. His personality, is demeanor etc. He is the type of character i\'d love to see in more shows. The other side characters are good too, better than most series, but I wish I could have gotten a bit more background on some of them.Enjoyment: 10/10 This series is hilarous and good. It will make you laugh, and keep you guessing as to how its going to play out. Seriously, you NEED to watch this series.Overall: A SOLID 9/10. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good time watching a real good isekai anime series. Just give the show a bit of a break in the art department. You will enjoy this series.

RIDE!This is such a mediocre anime in terms of production, but the characters and concept are INSANELY GOOD! The main character is one of the funniest people in anime history, and the supporting cast is equally fantastic. No harem nonsense so far, no suffocating seriousness, it's just a good time.In terms of story and production value, they are as I already mentioned pretty mediocre. In fact, the story is completely nonsensical; I mean the MC gets isekaied, then reverse isekaied, but it was actually just a dream, then isekaied to the future, then back again, and I mean... what do you even do...with this?But it doesn't really matter at all, since that's not the purpose of this anime at all, and it makes no pretenses in this regard, and that's honestly its strongest point. The character comedy is so good it could make up for literally any shortcoming of the production value or overall plot writing.As a final tidbit, I can heartily recommend the English dub made by Funimation on this one. It's actually extremely good, although you will miss out on the main side-character being voiced by the same guy who voices Connie Springer and Zenitsu. with this?But it doesn't really matter at all, since that's not the purpose of this anime at all, and it makes no pretenses in this regard, and that's honestly its strongest point.

I recommend it for those who like the isekai genre and for those who want to have a big laugh at the present situation.

I'm only going to be lightly referencing things done in the anime, but I am still marking this review with spoilers just in case.I don't normally write reviews for series, but it's been a while since I've found a random anime that I could not stop watching and ended up binging until 3 am.The Dungeon of Black Company stands out among isekai anime for a couple of reasons that really made it so much more enjoyable.For starters, the protagonist is just your average joe who wants to live an easy life without working. No special powers, no...harem, no hero status, just a normal dude.Then there's the female characters. They aren't made out to be super attractive and they aren't throwing themselves at the mc, nor are they there to simply be a pretty accessory to draw in a male audience with ecchi scenes. I found them to be quite likeable.Speaking of ecchi, I've never seen an anime that gives equal treatment to the male and female characters in the rare occasions that such scenes actually pop up, but this one did, and it was actually really entertaining.The story is actually pretty unique and ends the 12 episodes in a satisfying manner (the source material is still ongoing but I wouldn't mind if this anime was finished with this one season). On top of that, everything comes to a neat close with no loose ends, and explanations for everything that happened in the plot, like why he randomly got sent to another world.All in all, this was a satisfying watch to feed my isekai addiction. I didn't feel like there were overused tropes and cliches and cookie cutter characters that made it boring to the point I was only watching out of obligation. I would recommend this anime to people looking for fun isekai that breaks the norm for a breath of fresh air. harem, no hero status, just a normal dude.Then there's the female characters.

It focuses and jokes a lot about extreme modern capatalism.He has the stereotypical isekai transfer-to-another-world event, but there is no goddess and he\'s immediately slapped with debts and forced into the Black Company (company that exploits its workers), Raiza\'ha. He then procedes to work and try to make his way to the top again.The plot has plenty of twists and at the times seems like it doesn\'t take itself seriously, which adds to comedic element....The author loves to put capitalism in everything in the plot, which, despite its repetitive nature, I found original and entertaining.Art - 7=====The art follows the standard that most isekai in 2021 follow.

I feel like her voice alone contributed a lot to the family relationship between Rimu and Kinji.Character - 7=====I really like how Kinji is just openly scummy. He openly mentions that he views people as \'trash\' and wants to be \'above them.\' This makes him seem extremely childish, which adds to his humor.As I mentioned, the voice actor for Rimu did really well, which made her character a joy to see.Some characters were placed in random fanservice scenes, which was random and unexpected, but I didn\'t mind.Enjoyment - 9=====I watched this anime as it aired and it served as a good Friday watch. It was fun to see Kinji make his moves and try to control the world.

See, it has nothing to do with the anime itself as to why it caught my eye, but it was the fact that while this anime has an average MAL rating of around 7.2 (as of writing this), all of the most recommended reviews have it rated at least an 8. This is inherently interesting to me, because I am instantly curious why there is a large enough of percentage of viewers thinking this is good, to the point...that only highly positive reviews have gotten the most praise, but there are simultaneously enough people rating it negatively that despite all the positive reviews, its score still got bombed heavily. Dependent on your perspective, you could easily consider this anime to be ""underrated"" or ""overrated"", but why is that? What makes this anime so controversial amongst fans?Most people seem convinced that it\'s because Kinji is a heavily flawed character. Similar to the MCs from KonoSuba and Combatants Will be Dispatched, Kinji isn\'t some altruistic ""good guy"" who is just going to help because some random stranger asked him to, but if he finds a way for it to benefit himself, then he won\'t mind lending that helping hand. This is actually one of the strongest points of praise I’ve seen for this anime again and again, and while I would definitely say its a nice change, I don’t think its enough reason to throw an objective-driven appraisal out the window. Despite this, even if this is the reason The Dungeon of Company Black gets so much praise, we still haven’t seen exactly why it gets enough hate to swing the score down to a low 7.After a full-watch, I have to conclude that it would be episode 1, and honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if I read that a lot of viewers dropped after the first episode, why? Because I almost did, and, while I ultimately decided to stick around and give it the good ol’ 3-episode-try, I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of others didn’t. Now, assuming that you have no knowledge of this show, you’re probably wondering just how bad the first episode is, and well, its honestly not written poorly at all. You see, the major issue with episode 1 actually ties back to Kinji’s character, while Kinji is in no-way a ""good guy"", he’s honestly not a ""bad guy” either, except in episode 1, where he definitely is a “bad guy"". Kinji basically gets Isekai’d and then forced into working in hellish conditions for shit pay, but he’s also kind of acting like an elitist asshole, so you don’t really feel bad for him. Then, he happens to find a brainwashing staff that he uses to force his coworkers to work incredibly hard to the point that they’re constantly exhausted while Kinji enjoys the good life at their expense. Personally, I hate watching characters commit to asinine schemes that are clearly going to blow up in their faces (just like this one does for Kinji, shocking I know), but that’s not even the crux of the issue, the more pressing matter is that this entire first episode does a bang-up job of painting him as a “bad” person. This first episode makes Kinji out to be a way worse human being than he actually is, and I would say that his brainwashing stunt is downright the most manipulative and self-centered action he takes in this entire season.I wholly agree that the best characters are heavily flawed, however there is a mountain of difference between “heavily flawed” and “an un-relatable asshole”. Although, I would definitely say that by the end of the season Kinji is at least somewhat relatable, unlike how he is in his first episode debut. This creates another issue and which I\'m going to call skipped-growth. As mentioned before, Kinji doesn’t act nearly as selfishly as he does in the first episode, that could lead someone to believe that there is some level of character growth that explains this change, but plot-twist, there isn’t. I genuinely believe that a stronger episode, with a more accurate depiction of Kinji’s true nature would have resulted in the overall MAL score matching more closely to its most popular reviews. This is ultimately the heart of what I wanted to talk about in this review, but it feels wrong to only talk about the first episode, so here’s a short breakdown of my scores:Story: 6, Not overly impressive, and a little overly predictable at times, but unfortunately most of the points of praise I have go into a bag labeled “spoilers”, so I\'ll leave those out, just know that it definitely has its positive moments.Art: 7, Honestly was tempted to bump this up to an 8 just because I liked the character designs, but I feel that a 7 is the most accurate representation of the quality of the art and the consistence of said quality.Sound: 8, Voice acting (English and Japanese) were both good. I transitioned to sub when I ran out of dubbed episodes, and I gotta say, the voices between both versions seemed pretty similar. Solid OP and ED, ost fit will, even if not the most memorable.Character: 7, Mr. Wanibe is best, fight me. Genuinely though, I could’ve given this more points, but overall most of the characters lack enough depth and growth for me to think it deserving of more than a 7.Enjoyment: 9, I found myself enjoying this a little more with every episode, but given the fact that I almost dropped it to start, I suppose that shouldn’t be too surprising.Overall: 8, Im one of those weirdos who thinks about the score they’ll give something when they rate it while they are watching it, and about halfway through I only though id be giving this a 7, but as it progressed I felt it more deserving of something in the high 7 to low 8 range.If you decide to check this anime out, I’d highly recommend giving it a 3-episode-try, it’ll be worth it even if you didn’t like the first episode, in my opinion. that only highly positive reviews have gotten the most praise, but there are simultaneously enough people rating it negatively that despite all the positive reviews, its score still got bombed heavily.

Now, assuming that you have no knowledge of this show, you’re probably wondering just how bad the first episode is, and well, its honestly not written poorly at all. You see, the major issue with episode 1 actually ties back to Kinji’s character, while Kinji is in no-way a ""good guy"", he’s honestly not a ""bad guy” either, except in episode 1, where he definitely is a “bad guy"". Kinji basically gets Isekai’d and then forced into working in hellish conditions for shit pay, but he’s also kind of acting like an elitist asshole, so you don’t really feel bad for him. Then, he happens to find a brainwashing staff that he uses to force his coworkers to work incredibly hard to the point that they’re constantly exhausted while Kinji enjoys the good life at their expense. Personally, I hate watching characters commit to asinine schemes that are clearly going to blow up in their faces (just like this one does for Kinji, shocking I know), but that’s not even the crux of the issue, the more pressing matter is that this entire first episode does a bang-up job of painting him as a “bad” person. This first episode makes Kinji out to be a way worse human being than he actually is, and I would say that his brainwashing stunt is downright the most manipulative and self-centered action he takes in this entire season.I wholly agree that the best characters are heavily flawed, however there is a mountain of difference between “heavily flawed” and “an un-relatable asshole”. Although, I would definitely say that by the end of the season Kinji is at least somewhat relatable, unlike how he is in his first episode debut. This creates another issue and which I\'m going to call skipped-growth. As mentioned before, Kinji doesn’t act nearly as selfishly as he does in the first episode, that could lead someone to believe that there is some level of character growth that explains this change, but plot-twist, there isn’t. I genuinely believe that a stronger episode, with a more accurate depiction of Kinji’s true nature would have resulted in the overall MAL score matching more closely to its most popular reviews. This is ultimately the heart of what I wanted to talk about in this review, but it feels wrong to only talk about the first episode, so here’s a short breakdown of my scores:Story: 6, Not overly impressive, and a little overly predictable at times, but unfortunately most of the points of praise I have go into a bag labeled “spoilers”, so I\'ll leave those out, just know that it definitely has its positive moments.Art: 7, Honestly was tempted to bump this up to an 8 just because I liked the character designs, but I feel that a 7 is the most accurate representation of the quality of the art and the consistence of said quality.Sound: 8, Voice acting (English and Japanese) were both good. I transitioned to sub when I ran out of dubbed episodes, and I gotta say, the voices between both versions seemed pretty similar. Solid OP and ED, ost fit will, even if not the most memorable.Character: 7, Mr. Wanibe is best, fight me. Genuinely though, I could’ve given this more points, but overall most of the characters lack enough depth and growth for me to think it deserving of more than a 7.Enjoyment: 9, I found myself enjoying this a little more with every episode, but given the fact that I almost dropped it to start, I suppose that shouldn’t be too surprising.Overall: 8, Im one of those weirdos who thinks about the score they’ll give something when they rate it while they are watching it, and about halfway through I only though id be giving this a 7, but as it progressed I felt it more deserving of something in the high 7 to low 8 range.If you decide to check this anime out, I’d highly recommend giving it a 3-episode-try, it’ll be worth it even if you didn’t like the first episode, in my opinion.', 'This anime tried to a different kind of isekai and it greatly succeeded in it. Diffent from the anime ""How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom"", the solutions to the challenges were slightly less obvious and the the anime had a good plot. It is indeed a bit simplified and the \'how\' he solved some of the challenges was not portrayed. However, the story progression was already fast and covered in 12 episodes what most animes cover in at least 15 (or 30+ if it\'s One Piece), so there was no time for that. If they managed however, to include such complex details, the anime...would deserve a 9 or 10/10 rating.I am not a good judge of animation quality or voicing. As long as it\'s watchable, it\'s ok for me. This anime was quite above my bar for \'watchable\'.This anime also successfully employed a very rarely used, but I think sought after, setting: Modern World Magical Fantasy (RPG style). The technological development of that world was likely at about 1950 to 1990 level, bit it\'s not too obvious. In addition, it ridiculed unfair and harsh work environments and portrayed that people are at their best (happiest and most efficient) when having a goal and being treated well.I \'only\' gave an 8/10 in enjoyment, because comedy was part of the genre and the anime tried a few times to make the audience laugh, but rarely succeeded. Despite this, the story is very interesting and engaging, while still being easy to follow, without straining your brain too much.Plot summary (very minor spoilers):The MC is a clever, not good not bad, slightly irritating and moderately egoistic 24y old guy, who, through a few short years of hard work and wise investments, obtained financial freedom. He can fulfill his dream about becomming a NEET, without working anymore, as he lives in his owned high end apartment and receives a stable income from his investments.At the point where he was satisfied with his achievment and barely started to enjoy his NEET life, a portal sent him to a modern magical world with many different sentient and intelligent races. However, he becomes victim of the capitalist hellscape with barely any employee rights. His goal still being to live a stable and comfortable NEET life, in a world where even survival is a struggl for the lowest type of worker, he constantly thinks of how to beat the system and forces his plans on the people around him.

So big plus; It\'s fundamentally watchable. Otherwise, the show was really dry. There is little to no character depth or personality, story continuation from episode to episode is minimal so you can freely skip episodes without it effecting plot, and majority of the premise is the mc...being s*** on by higher ups after getting caught and losing everything he worked for in that episode/the episode previous.

It is a story of how MC moves up the ladder.I will ignore everything and get to the point. The main problem is that this show\'s redeeming quality is the MC, but not good enough overall.1. He claims to...be a NEET, but is a guy with absolute confidence / great people skills. He actually invests his salary and has three buildings in tokyo when he retires... why even bother calling him a NEET at all?2. The show says overworking in a black company as a bad thing, but it is MC who overworks people. He himself wants to break free of his work life, but has no problems with treating others like slaves. In fact, it even shows that MC is improving the output a lot by overworking employees and smh supporting his actions.3. The general direction of the plot. It tries to be too mysterious by not giving us many details about the isekai, but it doesn\'t make the plot more interesting. It tries to paint MC as a genius who can get out of any situation, but his success often relies on his OP loli dungeon monster friend or luck. Some people point out that he doesn\'t have any OP skills like in other isekai, but  He basically made friends with the strongest dungeon monster who can turn into a loli (ofcourse), and more or less uses her strength in his plans. This is his ""cheat OP skill"" that is common in most isekai. He can also rally anyone to his side using his talk-no-jutsu (very similar to Sora in NGNL).The anime gets much worse when they introduce time travel in ep 5 or 6. You still haven\'t setup the motivations and setting of the isekai world, why tf bother with timetravel???  At best, this is a satire/gag anime, why over complicate it?This anime tries to satirically comment on the black companies culture (wolf of wall street), but the writing is just not smart enough and would have worked much better as a gag comedy without the isekai parts.

Youka come across his past and must face it, as for Koko she stays beside him until a certain event breaks them apart for a period of time.The characters are more interesting in this season and some of them offer something new for the story.What I liked from this season is how well they handled Ribakushu's character (Master LI in the chinese version) and presented a more let's say human side of her.Also my favorite character from this season is not even human, it's a bird, a Condor who believe me or not helps Youka to overcome  his hardships and trains him.What I didn't like was Fung Gou who was so damn annoying for 26 episodes long and the fact that Koko still doesn't trust Youka 100% and runs away from him again...This time atleast they handled it better and we had a happy ending( a reward for the both of them).So in conclusion if you liked the first season and if you are curious , patient and don't mind chinese VA you can give this season a go and you will find yourselves wanting more at the end of it.It's a shame to not watch this, because many questions from the first season are answered and the story gets better with each episode.I myself gonna start the final season and write my thoughts about it in a form of a review. as they face new trials were they're bond and love is tested.

Fans of the manga, be prepared as these episodes are based almost word-for-word on stories from the first three volumes."", ""Ever since The Twilight Zone, there have been countless anthology shows consisting of supernatural parables made to be lessons and food-for-thought for the viewer. This trend is even present in anime. Case in point Petshop of Horrors, a 4 episode OVA produced by Madhouse in 1999. This collection of horror stories is quite Twilight Zone-esque in nature, with each episode being a stand alone parable. While the shows does have some things working against it, it is still a treat for fans of this type of show.The 4 stories are connected are by a petshop that secretly deals in strange creatures that come with a...set of rules that the owner must follow... or the shop will not be held accountable for what happens to them. Yeah, this sounds a lot like Gremlins now (the shop is even in Chinatown), but it works well as a set up for the stories. The costumers of the shop include A mother and Father who have recently lost their daughter; a man whose wife had died on their wedding day; an actor down on his luck; and the campaign manager of an aspiring politician. All of them have issues that come to light when they bring their new pets home. There is also a little extra continuity tossed in with a detective who is suspicious of the petshop and is constantly at odds with its owner, Count D.The first two stories unfold like like a mystery. In both cases the shop's costumer has suffered a loss of a loved one, but there is more to it than just that. There are circumstances behind the loved ones' deaths that are revealed as the story unfolds, which lead up to the parables' morals and, in both cases, grisly conclusions. The third plays out more like an inevitable tragedy with a cynical bit of irony at the end. The forth tale is by far the strangest, as we watch one of the character's desires being played out in a somewhat perverse way at the end. The show takes from both eastern and western mythologies for its supernatural elements, involving creatures such as mermaids, medusa, and kirin; which of course act as the catalyst of the story. Each story has interesting themes and is well paced, making the best of the time it has.This is not to say everything about this show is good, it certainly has some big shortcomings. The first of which is rather obvious, its length. With the show being only four episodes long it does not have the luxury to cover the wide array of topics a longer anthology could, and is consequently less impacting. There is also the issue with the stories themselves. It is true that they do work well as parables, but they have little to no subtly. The characters are fairly one dimensional (though not necessarily uncompelling) mostly there just to make a point. The delivery of the messages is pretty heavy handed, cut and dry with little left to think on. Finally, there is that little bit of continuity with detective Leon Orcot (I did not name him earlier) and Count D, which unfortunately goes nowhere. Neither character has any meaningful development, and only serve the role of someone for the viewer to follow  from episode to episode, and say the moral of the parable out loud.On the techinical side of things, Petshop of Horror is heavy with creepy atmosphere. The color pallet aims for both ominous and mystifying, and fulfills its role quite well. Character designs are fairly typical of 90's anime, though Count D and the 'pets' he sells look quite striking. Backgrounds aren't anything special, but get the job done. Honestly, the show looks best when it is being mystical and creepy; the opening scene with the tiger painting or the climax of any of the stories will attest to that. The music also goes for the spooky vibe, and while not anything special on its own, works well with the visuals and story to create an ominous atmosphere. One example of this is the insert song in the second episode, which is not particularly good, but is memorable because it was used to great effect.While not amongst the elite of its kind, Petshop of Horrors is certainly worth the small amount of time it takes up. Its stories are uniformly good, and have some interesting ideas which at the very least might make for good conversation material. If you are in the mood for something short, spooky, and just a tad thoughtful, then I recommend picking up this OVA. set of rules that the owner must follow... or the shop will not be held accountable for what happens to them.

You can certainly say that I was quite interested when I heard about Pershop of Horrors. And it was just 4 episodes so I decided to give it a try. It was indeed quite interesting, but very inconsistent. The 4 episodes were 4 different story\'s and they are very different both in themes and quality. So let\'s look at this promising mess.~story~ 5/10Count D (yes, that\'s really our main characters name) owns a pet shop in China Town, and as if that isn\'t weird enough he also looks like a gothic emo with… interesting eyes...(if you have already watched this anime, you know what I mean). Oh and he sells mythical creatures and the customers have to sign a creepy contract to buy these creatures. And if they break the contract, disaster and even death follow. Intriguing to say at least, our other main character, a police man named Leon, seems to think the same thing and is quite suspicious of this ""pet shop"". When clients of the pet shop die one after another, he tries his best to figure out what\'s going on and he kind of fails.There are 4 different stories about people who buy ""pets"" in the pet shop and then break the contract. Every story was very different, because of this the viewers have no time to learn more about the characters and by the end of the story you still don\'t know what was really going on. Why did Count D sell these mythical creatures? Where did he find them? There are so many unanswered questions and the anime was just way too short. Another problem was that the 4 story\'s all have a different atmosphere, the first two were darker than the last two. Because of this, it felt like the creators just picked 4 random stories added a creepy pet shop and then put them together in one anime.[CONCLUSION]The story had a lot of potential and it was very interesting. But it was way too short and it turned into a mess, an intriguing mess. A lot of questions remain unanswered and the story was very inconsistent, even though the themes were really interesting. It just could have been some much more if there were more episodes.~art~ 5/10The art just screams 90\'s, especially the character designs. But only Count D and some of his pets looked interesting, most of the other characters looked bland. The makers tried to create a dark, creepy and spooky atmosphere. Because of this a lot of dark colors were used, the animation itself was not that bad for an anime made in 1999, but it\'s certainly not good. Some of the character designs and the backgrounds were just lazy. Come on Madhouse, we all know you can do better than this.[CONCLUSION]The animation is mediocre and the character designs could have been better. It isn\'t extremely bad for a 90\'s anime but people who watch anime for the art and the pretty colors (I really hope that these kind of anime fans are a small minority) will be disappointed.~music~ 3/10To say the music was not the best part of this anime is an understatement. The opening and ending song were both extremely forgettable. For the background music and sounds, the sounds sometimes just disappeared and the background music was weak, though the music managed to create a spooky atmosphere now and then. And the English dub is officially one of the worst dubs ever made, just don\'t watch this anime with the dub when you care about your ears. The Japanese voice acting was better but still pretty weak.[CONCLUSION]The music and the sounds were by far the weakest part of this anime, the opening, ending and background music were forgettable and the dub is horrible.~characters~ 4/10There is literally no character development, normally this would have been enough to give the characters a 2/10. But the anime is just 4 episodes so I can\'t really blame the creators for having no time to properly develop the characters. Most characters only appear in one episode, these characters aren\'t particularly interesting but they serve their purpose and are more or less plot devices. Count D is quite charming and Leon is bland. There isn\'t much to say about the characters because there are only 4 episodes. But it\'s not a very strong aspect of this show.[CONCLUSION]The characters aren\'t well-developed, but this anime is only 4 episodes so that\'s logical. Count D is an decent character and everyone else is just very bland, but the characters aren\'t really bad, just boring.~enjoyment~ 7/10It was so promising and so intriguing, if there were more episodes and a better theme exploration this anime could have been great. Now, it\'s an interesting anime with a lot of flaws, bland characters and questions. But it\'s very enjoyable to watch and especially the third episode made me feel genuinely sad. I believe that this anime could be really good if it had more episodes, sadly enough it only has 4 episodes and it\'s just an advertisement for the manga.[CONCLUSION]It could have been so much more, damn you Madhouse. The music was a serious problem and the animation was weak. Also it was way too short, why was it only 4 episodes long?! But this anime is still pretty interesting and because of the fact that it only has 4 episodes, I still advice everyone to watch it, but only if you\'re really bored or when you have nothing better to do.

Petshop of Horrors is a four episode horror anthology OVA from Madhouse entertainment based on a ten volume Manga by Akino Matsuri. The manga has recently continued with a second series that's currently eight volumes in and still going, but that came after the OVA so I doubt very much that any of the elements or plot lines introduced within it are going to come up. Let's take a look at the OVA and see what mysteries this little shop contains.Since the series is an anthology without an underlying narrative, lets look at the...setup. There's a pet shop in a Chintown within the United States run by a man known as Count D. He sells regular pets as well as exotic ones to certain, deserving, customers. All of these pets come with a three condition contract. If any of these conditions are broken, then the shop assumes no responsibility for the consequences. In the meantime, a homicide detective named Leon is looking into Count D since so many unsolved deaths seem to involve customers of his shop. The stories in this are interesting. They have really good atmosphere, build up and legitimately creepy moments as well. They aren't scary, but they're the closest to horror I've come across all month.The characters are very important in this series and not just the reoccurring characters like Count D and Leon, but also the characters who are the focuses of individual episodes. Count D's special customers are always there for karmic reasons and his rules offer them a last chance at redemption. Figuring out why they merit karmic retribution is one of the interesting facets and it's never something overly simplistic. Which results in having to spend some time getting to know that character. Some of the episodes do it better than others, but all of them do it fairly well. The characters of Count D and Leon are well developed as well. My one issue in this area is that Leon's co-workers, who show up occasionally in his scenes, come off as bland and under-developed. But each one probably only gets five minutes of screen time cumulative. So that's really a very minor issue.The art in this is quite superb. The expressions are very well drawn. The animals are really cool looking. Count D's wardrobe is magnificent. That's probably a strange thing to say, but his attire is very well drawn and just well designed. The character designs in general are just really good. The art is excellent and really well detailed.The voice acting is excellent particularly Seki Toshihiko as Count D. The music and sounds in general are also excellent. Which helps contribute to the atmosphere.The ho-yay factor is a 4/10. Things between Count D and Leon get pretty homo-erotic. To the point where there are moments where you wonder if Leon is actually investigating him or trying to work up the courage to ask him on a date.So, that's Petshop of Horrors. It has great atmosphere, compelling characters and interesting story lines. The art and voice acting are both excellent and it has a bit of ho-yay. It may not be frightening, but it does manage some creepy moments. My final rating on this one is a 9/10. I do recommend checking it out.That does it for the last review of October. Going into November I have requests to review: Honey and Clover, Robotics;Notes, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Psycho Pass, Dennou Coil, Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro Chan and Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Waru.

But I only recently got to watch it, once the DVD was re-released (and you can bet I watched it as soon as I got the DVD home from the store). I heard a lot of good things about it, and luckily it lived up to them all. Pet Shop of Horrors is an OVA that was originally released in Japan in 1999, and first released in the US by Urban Vision in 2000. It is based on a manga...by Matsuri Akino, and the OVA was directed by Toshio Hirata.Pet Shop of Horrors is largley an episodic horror series, although there is one little overarching story. Each episode involves someone or a group of people aproaching Count D, the owner of a creepy petshop in China town, for a pet. But these people have heard stories that the Count\'s pet\'s are not normal, and this is anything but an average petshop in L.A. (yeh this takes place in California) . The people going to see the count seek more then just a regular pet, and they useally get what they want. But not without a warning from the mysterious and quirky Count . ""Do this, and that"" he says ""Follow the rules...don\'t breach the contract"" he states. And as long as the people follow his rules, they will be ok, better then ok because they get the strange wonder that they wished for. For example two greiving parents enter the petshop in search of something , and what does the Count present them with? Their dead daughter of course, only she\'s not dead, she there, alive and well. Only the Count keeps insisting that it\'s not really their daughter, but its actually a rabbit. Just a regular rabbit. Rabbit or no rabbit the parents want their daughter back. So they buy their child, and take her home. But they also sign the Count\'s contract, which says no one else should see the ""rabbit"", and they should only feed it vegetables and water no matter what, because after all rabbits don\'t eat people food. But when their child begs for real food, for cookies, what do you think the parents will do? It\'s all very reminiscent of the time when their child was in the hospital, dealing with withdrawls from some illegal drug. And just like when she was in the hospital they cave in and give her what she wants, even though they know it\'s not in her best interest. Just because they can\'t stand to watch her suffer. I won\'t ruin what happens, but let\'s just say you don\'t breach the Count\'s contract and live a happy life afterwards. Braking the contract can destroy you, and everyone around you as well. Many of the episodes play out this way, they are mostly a set of morality tales (think Tales from the Crypt or the 1989 Live Action movie Creepshow). And they are all incredbly frightening at times. There are some very creepy scenes in this anime. Some of the themes this anime deals with are very interesting. And some of the characters will really stand out. Also this series will impact you emotionally a little, which is always a plus in my book.(***Slight Spoiler***)The only real problem with this series is that none of the characters listen to the count, and follow his directions, even when they are quite easy. This is a little hard to believe. Every single character brakes the contract with the count in one way or another. This of course leads to a rather tragic conclusion to each episode, and makes me think these people are all very stupid. Ok so I can believe a few of them won\'t listen to him, but all of them? Someone out there has to have a brain, shame none of them get a pet from the Count, I\'d like to see how that would play out.(***End Spoiler***)Of course this brings me to my next small problem with the show, it\'s two damn short! Perhaps if they had made more episodes, this would have fixed the first problem of the show, because they could have taken the show in many different directions, but lack of episodes made them want to focus on what they did. Anyway this is a show that could have gone on for 12 or even 24 episodes and still stayed fresh, and it\'s truly a shame that it didn\'t. That\'s my only other real beaf with it. Oh and while you watch this, keep an eye out for the Star Wars and Mark Hamill refferences. Not sure why, but I found them quite amusing.And it\'s also worth noting that they overarching story involves Detective Leon Orcot trying to prove Count D is up to no good, and that his petshop is directly responsible for all the unexplainable deaths and missing people. We follow Leon as he tries to prove the Count is really behind all these things, despite Leon\'s boss just thinking he\'s stressed out or worse, crazy. Leon keeps investigatingthe Count up until the last episode, and although he seems to be discovering quite a bit of evidence here and there, nothing much comes of it. It feels very open ended, like perhaps there\'s more about this in the manga or something? Because after everything is said and done, it doesn\'t really matter because the show just ends. It gave me a feeling of ""ok so what was the point?"". Although it is nice to have some sort of story develop over the four episodes, but I can\'t help from thinking that it would have been even better for it to have gone somewhere (like Leon proving for once and for all that the Count was behind everything, or the Count stoping Leon some how). But I did like how the overarching story played out. And some of the funnyest, and weirdest moments happen when Leon is talking to the Count . The way the count plays with Leon is just great. And it\'s during these scenes that we really see just how odd, eccentric, and quirky the Count really is. He\'s much less serious when he\'s talking to the Detective, and the way these characters intereact is just fun to watch. As the Detective Leon is truly trying to get the root of everything, and the Count really just doesn\'t care, and likes to mess with him, and play games with him. Watching the two interact is a strong point of the series. Although I have to mention I think Leon is very boring in comparision to the Count. But I guess it\'s not really fair to compare anyone to the Count, because he\'s quite a character, and anyone would seem boring in comparison. But I do wish Detective Leon was a bit more interesting. Even some of the minor and episodic characters are much more interesting in comparison, which to me is a bad sign. But this is a very small problem, and it\'s easily over looked.As far as the artwork goes in this anime, I thought it was great. For 1999 it did seem a little simple, but overall I thought it was very well done. The backgrounds look like their watercolored but very nice. Although at times they do appear to be a litle cheap looking. I did enjoy some of the interior shots, as I felt they were very dark and creepy looking, which is a must for this show. It\'s not too detailed, but I did like everything. The character designs were however perfect for this show. All of them were original, in a different style, and just looked great. Extra points for the oddball design of the Count, and all the creepy monster/pet designs. The only real problem with the artwork is it feels a little flat, like the characters can\'t really move back and forth very well. It feels like they are stuck in a spot. There really isn\'t an illusion of real physical space for these characters. But this isn\'t a big deal or anything, it\'s just something Madhouse usually does quite well, and didn\'t seem to bother with much here.As far as the music goes, it\'s fitting. It\'s all very spooky and atmospheric. I liked it alot, although it\'s nothing outstanding or anything. Some of it had a great 80\'s detective vibe, that felt very Jazzy, which I loved. And some of it had a horror-feeling going on, which was also quite good. As far as the dub goes, I thought it was great. Detective Leon is played by Alex Fernandez, who fits the part, but feels a little lost and confused at times. But he has a great voice, and really can act when need be. He just needed a little more guidence in my opinion. But he is useally quite good. It is a shame his performance is not as good as it could have been, but I personally blame the director. Count D is played by John Demita, who makes the character feel spooky, otherworldly, and odd. In a word, he\'s perfect. He really helps bring out the eccentricities when need be, and bring out the spooky side of his character, when it\'s time. This guy knows what he\'s doing, and I just wish he\'d be cast in more roles. I rather liked his performance and he has a really unique voice. The other detectives that work with Leon are cast quite well, and do a good job. The minor characters are useally great, although a few are quite bad (the guy who get\'s a Tiger in episode 1, really all of that sounds pretty bad). But the good easily out weights the bad. It is a very fresh sounding dub too. My only other problem with it is some lines here and there feel a little awkward. But overall this is a great dub, even though it does feel like it aged quite a bit. It probally won\'t stand up well against today\'s dubs, but for my viewing it was more then adequate. Plus John Demita for the win, really. He\'s just nuts at times.So overall the series is quite spooky at times, has some great themes, and is way too short. We need more episodes of this great anime. The animation was good, and the artowkr was great, but I felt it was a little below average from Madhouse at the time. The character desings are exellent however. It\'s a great show, that any horror fan would love. I highly recommend it!- Review copyed from my personal blog- Original review posted at: http://predeanimereview.blogspot.com/2009/10/pet-shop-of-horrors.html by Matsuri Akino, and the OVA was directed by Toshio Hirata.Pet Shop of Horrors is largley an episodic horror series, although there is one little overarching story. Each episode involves someone or a group of people aproaching Count D, the owner of a creepy petshop in China town, for a pet. But these people have heard stories that the Count\'s pet\'s are not normal, and this is anything but an average petshop in L.A. (yeh this takes place in California) . The people going to see the count seek more then just a regular pet, and they useally get what they want. But not without a warning from the mysterious and quirky Count . ""Do this, and that"" he says ""Follow the rules...don\'t breach the contract"" he states. And as long as the people follow his rules, they will be ok, better then ok because they get the strange wonder that they wished for. For example two greiving parents enter the petshop in search of something , and what does the Count present them with? Their dead daughter of course, only she\'s not dead, she there, alive and well. Only the Count keeps insisting that it\'s not really their daughter, but its actually a rabbit. Just a regular rabbit. Rabbit or no rabbit the parents want their daughter back. So they buy their child, and take her home. But they also sign the Count\'s contract, which says no one else should see the ""rabbit"", and they should only feed it vegetables and water no matter what, because after all rabbits don\'t eat people food. But when their child begs for real food, for cookies, what do you think the parents will do? It\'s all very reminiscent of the time when their child was in the hospital, dealing with withdrawls from some illegal drug. And just like when she was in the hospital they cave in and give her what she wants, even though they know it\'s not in her best interest. Just because they can\'t stand to watch her suffer. I won\'t ruin what happens, but let\'s just say you don\'t breach the Count\'s contract and live a happy life afterwards. Braking the contract can destroy you, and everyone around you as well. Many of the episodes play out this way, they are mostly a set of morality tales (think Tales from the Crypt or the 1989 Live Action movie Creepshow). And they are all incredbly frightening at times. There are some very creepy scenes in this anime. Some of the themes this anime deals with are very interesting. And some of the characters will really stand out. Also this series will impact you emotionally a little, which is always a plus in my book.(***Slight Spoiler***)The only real problem with this series is that none of the characters listen to the count, and follow his directions, even when they are quite easy. This is a little hard to believe. Every single character brakes the contract with the count in one way or another. This of course leads to a rather tragic conclusion to each episode, and makes me think these people are all very stupid. Ok so I can believe a few of them won\'t listen to him, but all of them? Someone out there has to have a brain, shame none of them get a pet from the Count, I\'d like to see how that would play out.(***End Spoiler***)Of course this brings me to my next small problem with the show, it\'s two damn short! Perhaps if they had made more episodes, this would have fixed the first problem of the show, because they could have taken the show in many different directions, but lack of episodes made them want to focus on what they did. Anyway this is a show that could have gone on for 12 or even 24 episodes and still stayed fresh, and it\'s truly a shame that it didn\'t. That\'s my only other real beaf with it. Oh and while you watch this, keep an eye out for the Star Wars and Mark Hamill refferences. Not sure why, but I found them quite amusing.And it\'s also worth noting that they overarching story involves Detective Leon Orcot trying to prove Count D is up to no good, and that his petshop is directly responsible for all the unexplainable deaths and missing people. We follow Leon as he tries to prove the Count is really behind all these things, despite Leon\'s boss just thinking he\'s stressed out or worse, crazy. Leon keeps investigatingthe Count up until the last episode, and although he seems to be discovering quite a bit of evidence here and there, nothing much comes of it. It feels very open ended, like perhaps there\'s more about this in the manga or something? Because after everything is said and done, it doesn\'t really matter because the show just ends. It gave me a feeling of ""ok so what was the point?"". Although it is nice to have some sort of story develop over the four episodes, but I can\'t help from thinking that it would have been even better for it to have gone somewhere (like Leon proving for once and for all that the Count was behind everything, or the Count stoping Leon some how). But I did like how the overarching story played out. And some of the funnyest, and weirdest moments happen when Leon is talking to the Count . The way the count plays with Leon is just great. And it\'s during these scenes that we really see just how odd, eccentric, and quirky the Count really is. He\'s much less serious when he\'s talking to the Detective, and the way these characters intereact is just fun to watch. As the Detective Leon is truly trying to get the root of everything, and the Count really just doesn\'t care, and likes to mess with him, and play games with him. Watching the two interact is a strong point of the series. Although I have to mention I think Leon is very boring in comparision to the Count. But I guess it\'s not really fair to compare anyone to the Count, because he\'s quite a character, and anyone would seem boring in comparison. But I do wish Detective Leon was a bit more interesting. Even some of the minor and episodic characters are much more interesting in comparison, which to me is a bad sign. But this is a very small problem, and it\'s easily over looked.As far as the artwork goes in this anime, I thought it was great. For 1999 it did seem a little simple, but overall I thought it was very well done. The backgrounds look like their watercolored but very nice. Although at times they do appear to be a litle cheap looking. I did enjoy some of the interior shots, as I felt they were very dark and creepy looking, which is a must for this show. It\'s not too detailed, but I did like everything. The character designs were however perfect for this show. All of them were original, in a different style, and just looked great. Extra points for the oddball design of the Count, and all the creepy monster/pet designs. The only real problem with the artwork is it feels a little flat, like the characters can\'t really move back and forth very well. It feels like they are stuck in a spot. There really isn\'t an illusion of real physical space for these characters. But this isn\'t a big deal or anything, it\'s just something Madhouse usually does quite well, and didn\'t seem to bother with much here.As far as the music goes, it\'s fitting. It\'s all very spooky and atmospheric. I liked it alot, although it\'s nothing outstanding or anything. Some of it had a great 80\'s detective vibe, that felt very Jazzy, which I loved. And some of it had a horror-feeling going on, which was also quite good. As far as the dub goes, I thought it was great. Detective Leon is played by Alex Fernandez, who fits the part, but feels a little lost and confused at times. But he has a great voice, and really can act when need be. He just needed a little more guidence in my opinion. But he is useally quite good. It is a shame his performance is not as good as it could have been, but I personally blame the director.

He really helps bring out the eccentricities when need be, and bring out the spooky side of his character, when it\'s time. This guy knows what he\'s doing, and I just wish he\'d be cast in more roles. I rather liked his performance and he has a really unique voice. The other detectives that work with Leon are cast quite well, and do a good job. The minor characters are useally great, although a few are quite bad (the guy who get\'s a Tiger in episode 1, really all of that sounds pretty bad). But the good easily out weights the bad. It is a very fresh sounding dub too. My only other problem with it is some lines here and there feel a little awkward.

It didn't really feel like an anime but it was still good.  It could best be described as a mix of Needful Things and Tales From the Crypt.  Not really eerie or creepy but more of a show of human nature and people getting their just desserts when they follow their desires with little regard for the rules. "", ""For any fans of Tales from the Crypt, this is most definitely the anime for you. Each episode follows a different character who has visited the pet shop. This 4 episode OVA is filled with creepy and spooky tales, and at the end of the episode, you may just learn a lesson or moral from each story.StoryPet Shop of Horrors is about a strange gothic young man named Count D who manages a pet shop. However, this is no average pet shop. At this pet shop you can find a wide variety of 'rare' and 'exotic' animals. All you need to do is sign a...contract with this man, and it's yours. However, you may find these rules hard to abide with, and end up with a disaster in which even death may occur.I'm a big fan of episodic series, so this anime was definitely a hit for me. Each story was creepy and interesting, and the animal the characters ordered corresponded with the owners inner demons and troubles.What really got me interested was that at the end of each episode, a very interesting moral was taught. That was probably my favorite aspect of the show, besides the spooky ominous feel to it.I also found the concept of this series very unique. The idea of a creepy 'animal' from a pet shop to move a long an entire story really intrigued me. I love animals, and like to learn about mystical creatures, so when I saw the title, I was automatically drawn in. This series definitely did not disappoint. Even with my high expectations, Pet Shop of Horrors exceeded them with its eerie tales of the characters dark pasts and their new pet which may in the end teach them a lesson.AnimationPet Shop of Horrors was released in 1999, so the animation is quite dated. I went into the story with low expectations of the art, but I was actually surprised. Yes, the animation was definitely not the best, but it was fitting, and was actually very well done for its time. It was also very unique in a way as well. There was no set style or pattern I could find. For example Count D and the detective Leon, have a totally different style. With the Count, his features were very pointed while Leon's were much more realistic and better shaded. This goes for not only these two, but for many other characters as well.The character designs were pretty interesting as well, especially the Count. His tall, yet feminine figure added to his mysterious personality, along with his painted long nails, dark lips always in a small smile, and his hetereochromic eyes narrowed at you. The creature designs were interesting and haunting as well. This anime would have been a flop without the creepy and spooky animation.SoundThere's not to much music in this anime, but nothing felt out of place or unfitting. When there was music, it only added to the dark atmosphere. No music needed to be added or deleted, and it felt as if everything was in order.As for voice acting, it was very well done. I personally watched the dub, and each voice matched the character perfectly. I especially liked the Count's voice actor, as he sounded very calm and collected even while delivering disturbing lines, which built up the Count's character even more, and added to his eerie aura. Considering the importance and amount of dialogue the Count has, it was very important to have an excellent voice actor, which is another thing Pet Shop of Horrors did very wellCharactersSince Pet Shop of Horrors is episodic, there is a large variety of characters, but does not feel overcrowded since each set is different in each episode. The only characters which remained throughout was Count D, the tall dark mysterious pet shop owner, and Leon Orcot, the hot headed detective suspects the Count for the recent string of murders, and is determined to expose Count D for his crimes.Leon acts as an extra viewpoint, and as a piece to help dig up the other characters backgrounds.As for the customers and main characters of an episode, they all seem to have a dark past or secret which indirectly causes them to end up at the Count's shop to fulfill their desires through their new pet. As each episode progresses we learn more and more about each character, and finally discover who they really are. At the end of each episode, these characters' backstories and mistakes serve as a lesson or moral to the story.OverallOverall, Pet Shop of Horrors gets a solid 9 out of 10. This short series was a psychological horror masterpiece, and deserves to be appraised for its thought provoking spooky stories. This show is definitely one of my favorites and is a must watch for any psychological or horror fan. contract with this man, and it's yours.

With only 4 episodes you should not come in expecting a big story line or a lot of character development.

The sound quailty is good enough but there isn't a need for amazing sound effects or things like that in this anime.{CHARACTERS - 7}With a different character each episode there is not a lot of time to fully connect with the character but in each 20 minute episode you can get a feel for what the character's personality is and how they act under certain circumstances. Count Drac is a very interesting character with a very low, calm and sultry voice. He is very eccentric and most people who would meet him in real life would find him slightly creepy proabably, but there is something about his characetr that makes you intrigued about his motives behind giving these people the pets he sells and how he manages to come upon.{ENJOYMENT - 6}It did take me a few tries to finish this anime even with it being only 4 episodes long.

Regardless of this, I truly adore it all the same. While the manga displays the Count's humor quite often, the manga takes a look at the darker side of things, taking 4 stories from...the first part of the manga series. The art of this series is very nostalgic in its style, but still an absolute masterpiece in my opinion, as are the sound tracks and voice actors, especially the people involved in developing the series for the fact that they managed to somehow keep the character depth for all those involved, once again despite it only lasting for four episodes and the majority of characters only having a single episode each; and on top of this despite allowing the viewer to feel as if they're beginning to partially understand the count and his motives, by the end of it, it becomes clear that his mystery was kept more than well in tact.All in all, I would recommend this series to anyone looking for something darker with small hints of humor, and who enjoys more nostalgic feeling anime. the first part of the manga series.

I came into the show thinking it would be generic vintage trash, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good each episode was. Episode one is decent but a bit unbelievable. Two and three are the best, and four is the worst but still solid.The only real problem with the show, in my opinion, is its four-episode runtime leaves plot points unanswered, which are supposedly only answered in the manga. Despite this, I still enjoyed the anime, and haven't personally read the manga.

It's a good anime if you are bored with nothing else to do and want a slightly good scare. "", 'Petshop of Horrors is a collection of short stories that has been best described as a cross between The Twilight Zone and Needful Things. It’s a series of mysteries that are also parables. While there is some continuity due to the presence of Count D, Detective Orcot, and the petshop, each episode is a stand-alone story about one of the petshop’s customers who is suffering in some way and seeks a supernatural remedy. As one might expect, these tragic characters frequently meet tragic ends brought about by the very character traits that led to their deplorable condition in the first place.The best thing about the...series is that it excels at storytelling. Even though the episodes are only 20 minutes, each manages to deliver a highly original and interesting mystery that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end. Episodes 2 and 3 are especially good and show just how exceptional a writer Matsuri Akino can be. Were this a substantially longer series, I would recommend it without reservation.Unfortunately, Petshop of Horrors is just a small sampling of the 10 volume manga, and it simply wasn’t possible to do it justice in such a short time. Count D and Detective Orcot, rather than dynamic main characters, function solely as a way to tie the stories together and provide a voice to narrate the morals. And while the first three episodes are quite good, the last is not really a mystery and ends abruptly. This is perhaps fitting: there is no overarching plot, so there isn’t really a reason to have an ending.The series also suffers from notably poor production values. It’s not very old, but the animation looks much older (think late 80s), and not in the good nostalgic way. And while the character and animal designs are quite good, many shots are dark or blurry, and the framerate often results in choppy movement.The soundtrack has a couple of nice tracks (e.g., Damage), but on the whole it’s pretty lacking, and many of the songs don’t fit the show at all. Dope, for instance, sounds like something out of an 80s porno. The Japanese voice cast is fine. The English voice cast arguably has a better Count D, but Detective Orcot’s voice is cringeworthy.Petshop of Horrors is a good example of how much production values and budget matter. Hopefully Madhouse or another studio will decide to pick up the full story in the future and dedicate the resources it deserves. In the meantime, you can at least see a snapshot of the manga brought to life. At four episodes, there’s not much to recommend, but it’s also a small investment for a potentially large return. series is that it excels at storytelling.

While the premise is simple - the girls make chocolate for people they appreciate - the pay-off goes deep, as each girl gives her chocolate to persons they are closely connected with.

Super Lovers OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33013/Super_Lovers_OVA,"[""I can't believe no one has written a review for this OVA yet! Anyway, I hope people find this review helpful. Firstly, MAL says that there are two episodes to this, which is true, but the two episodes represent the OVAs for the respective seasons of Super Lovers. I found the first one on KissAnime, but I found the second one on Dailymotion somewhere. Either way, they weren't too hard to find.The plot of these is not really relevant to the overarching story, but they are very enjoyable to watch nonetheless. If you liked Super Lovers, then you will like these two episodes. Both...episodes have basic plots that end with Haru and Ren strengthening their relationship. I like the first one more, personally, because they go on a date and it's really sweet :). The comedic aspect of the series is also present here too, which just makes this OVA that much better. I liked this OVA (and the series in general) because, despite their relationship being kinda weird (the whole brother thing....), both characters are relatively outward about their feelings for each other. Contrast this with an anime like Junjo Romantica/Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, where the main character (Misaki/Onodera) can't get his love off his chest. In my opinion, that's what made this anime a more refreshing entry to the Shounen Ai genre.TL;DR - If you liked Super Lovers, then you will like this.

The concept is there, but man, it\'s way too short. 55 minutes is a slap in a face when it\'s called a movie. The first 5 minutes are a recap, the credits run for like 4 minutes and the ending part half a minute. The ending implies there\'s more to come, so I won\'t touch...on it much. Read the manga if you want to know what\'s probably coming next. Anyway, story is same old same old. Pretty predictable. I\'d say 30% of the whole ""movie"" is the fight scene, which is really short. Then again, I\'ve never read this part of the story before in the manga, so I have no idea where the source is from.Art: 10/10The anime was somewhat ok, but that was kind of expected, given the manga is still young (only 60 something chapters so far, translated) but they stepped it up in the movie. The art style similarly resembles KyoAni except the eyes. Everything flows really smoothly, the transitions from serious to relaxing is greatly appreciated. Nothing to complain here.Sound: 10/10Hm, I did not expect that soundtracks like what they chose would fit in really well. The background music when connecting to their respective archives also make it seem all huzzah and epic. Excellent choices by the animators.Character: 9/10Continuation in each person\'s behaviour.

Lilith is the female lead of the anime and shes the more shy and nice type aswell. little not here is that i did like all the other side characters no really annoyed me.Enjoyment: honsetly i did like this the comedy was good (not as good as the anime) and it seems they upped the ecchi in this which idm but honestly they could have done this as a season 2 instead a movie cause yeah there are plot holes easily like why did the whie demon like suddenly appear and also have that happen so fast when they could have done that for awhole second season.Overall: it gets a 7 out of me the comedy was good and it being lewd is a plus but the fact for the plot holes gives me this rating story)Art: the art was pretty much the same as the anime so yeah it was goodSound: again sound was good Op and Ed were decentCharacter: Mira is a pretty pure in the sense you can well tell that by the way she acts and what not. Lieselotte is the perv side of im asuming her twin or somthing like that thats pretty much her. Lilim is the daughter (if you could say that) too Lilith and Arata and she the more go lucky and cheery type of girl. Yui is basically the same as Lilim a pretty go happy girl and what not.

I have been avoiding this movie for a while because I thought the movie wouldn't be as good as the anime and what do you know I was right. Anyway, let's start my review. Also, SPOILER WARNING, if you want to watch this garbage then, be my guest.Story 3/10- So our main character had a dream where he was about to die and then he wakes up to...see his harem with him. He comes in touch with red haired girl's grimoire and it becomes a child, consuming both their magic. Later, we see some random character who is a demon lord who wants to kill main boy to become the DEMON LORD.I feel like the story has no sense of direction whatsoever. It tries so hard to be a harem, action, emotional movie within a 55 minute movie. Hell, the MAIN VILLAIN IN THE MOVIE GOT LIKE 5 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME. The fanservice lasted longer than the main villain in the show, which is sad. The main focus in the movie was this little girl they made in like the first 5 minutes in the movie, which didn't even add anything new to the story, except here's a new girl to my harem. She was just there and didn't contribute to anything at all, except help the main character get an asspull to win the battle which he was LOSING for not even 3 MINUTES.. 3 FUCKING MINUTES.  If I kept talking about this AWFUL PLOT, I would be here all day, so I will stop for now. Overall, its a complete mess of a plot.Art 6/10- Its an anime from 2017, of course it looks decentSound 3/10- No emotion from the voice actresses and the sound they used for the attacks hurt my ears.Characters 2/10- You can already tell that an anime that has 9 MAIN CHARACTERS, A NEW MAIN CHARACTER (making it 10), A NEW VILLAIN, AND EXTRA SIDE CHARACTERS would already seems difficult to make them all interesting and each of them standout for their actions in a 55 minute movie. Also, the main focal points of the movie were so boring, so generic, it made me feel like I was watching a documentary. Hell, I rather watch a documentary than this. Also, FANSERVICE SUCKS ASS.. I dont mind fanservice, but it felt forced throughout the entire movie. Hell, I think we saw more fanservice than action in this movie, which is disappointing.Enjoyment 2/10- I can't enjoy something that is so boring and almost made me sleep.Overall 3/10- TL;DR- Unless you are a die-hard Trinity Seven fan, don't watch the movies. Boring characters, no sense of direction, terrible voice-acting, unnecessary fanservice, need i say more see his harem with him.

Instead we got this movie which wasn\'t too bad.Story 6:Nothing really stands out about this movie story-wise.  The concept of the bad guy in this one is decent (although I might be underscoring based on how much I\'ve seen that concept used recently).  The usual cast of characters returns and you get a little bit of everything the show offered in its first season.Art 9:  I\'ve always loved the art in this show, perhaps more than I...ought to.  Always been a fan of that darker lighting and darker colors.  Regardless of any bias there\'s always something to be said of the ""sun"" animations and how much textures and colors abruptly change during breakdowns.  Character art is great as always.Sound 8:  The sounds are all just so appropriate for this show.  From the combat sound effects to the background music in pretty much all situations the sound here is fitting and adds to the appeal of this movie.Character 7:  If this movie was longer or perhaps split into two parts or just given more time for anything I\'d give this movie an 8 like I gave the show.  The biggest problem I have here is that the movie basically only used half of the characters well and the others were just barely given enough time to remind us of what they do.Enjoyment 7:  I\'m biased here too as I really just wanted more for this series than a movie.  The movie itself is fun to watch and a must-see for Trinity Seven fans.  I\'ll say the action in this movie is intriguing upon initial presentation but ends up being too hurried.  Ultimately its the usual interactions we\'ve grown accustomed to from 12 episode series that deliver much of the enjoyment in my opinion.Overall I would recommend this series to any Trinity Seven fan, its a must see in the sense that its the first bit of anime we\'ve gotten from this series in 2 years and for an hour long movie (which is really just 45 mins of new stuff) it watches quickly.  A lot of the movie does seem somewhat rushed but I suppose that\'s a given considering time constraints. ought to.  Always been a fan of that darker lighting and darker colors.

It was interesting and different compared to other anime that I've seen. I rewatched it when it got a dub, and I enjoyed it even more. So, when I learned there was going to be a movie, I was pretty excited. I was wanting to see what was going to happen next. Sure I could go an read the manga, but I'm not that interested. So now on to what I thought about this movie. Well to put it bluntly it was very good, and I enjoyed watching it. I did...have some problems with it though. The movie was short, though most anime movies are. It felt like this movie could have been stretched to be a second season. Everything kind jumped too far too fast. It didn't take too much away from it though, but this sort of just felt like a long special. There really wasn't much of a fight, even though it seemed like there was going to be one. All in all, this movie was very good, and I'm glad to see something new for Trinity Seven. have some problems with it though. The movie was short, though most anime movies are.

Honestly, I think that it would've been for the best to leave the ending of the episodes to leave it as it was, but the short movie was an exception. It focused more on the relationship of Ayata-whatever and that one red-haired girl (curse my vague memory), and added extra fan service with the other cute girls being involved with this story extension. Honestly, if you enjoyed Trinity Seven a lot, I would recommend watching this. If you didn't like Trinity Seven, well, you can watch this, but you'll be disappointed with it's...rushed timing and scrambled plot. That's, also, of course, if you're an anime extremist who takes every aspect of the anime into consideration other than your enjoyment.This, in my opinion, was an awesome after story—or addition—to the original season. It allowed us to see the final development between all of the characters combined, and to see how dynamic they all had become. I thank the publishers of this movie for giving me the chance to view it. 10/10 rushed timing and scrambled plot.

I say that because while the original source material for the main series is a manga, the source material for this film is a spin off novel. As such, it’s not exactly filler, but it’s also not likely to have any major lasting impact on the story. It’s also very clearly designed for fans of the main series and obviously expects you to have watched that, though it...does provide a quick summary at the beginning for those that may have forgotten. Still, if you didn’t like that the main series this certainly won’t change your mind, or rather you’ll probably dislike it even more.The film essentially has two core plot aspects. The first involves Lilim, which is Lilith’s grimoire gaining a human form after sucking up Arata’s magic. As she’s born from the magic of both Arata and Lilith, she both acts and serves as a daughter like figure to both of them, which produces a good amount of fluff with both of them. She’s also just in general supposed to be really cute, which produces even more fluff with the rest of the cast. This is the focus for the first third or so of the film. After that, though it shifts to focusing on the other core plot aspect, Lilim once again becomes the focus again surrounding the climax. It’s at this point that the film feels pretty rushed. Lilim’s portion of the climax and beyond involves the viewer being invested in Lilim as well as Arata and Lilith’s bond with her in order for the emotional beats to land. While I was somewhat invested, I felt that there wasn’t enough build up in regard to investment in her for the emotional beats the film was trying to use, and thus while it did have some impact it felt like it was somewhat lacking. Thus, while there was a really solid start regarding this plot aspect, the movie felt like it pushed into the climax too quickly to really do it properly.The second plot aspect involves a mysterious foe known as the white demon lord, Last Trinity, awakening and trying to defeat Arata to replace him. This is incredibly simple and pretty much just involves a couple small battles and a final larger one, where the cast all show their stuff and Arata even gains a new power, though I’m in doubt on whether he’ll keep it beyond this film. There is some attempt at giving the white demon lord some background that was maybe intended to make the viewer feel somewhat sympathetic towards him, but it felt very superficial and simply wasn’t fleshed out enough for it to work properly, which further leads to the film feeling kind of rushed pacing wise. Still, the action was decent enough and I’d say at about the level of the best from the main series so this felt pretty solid overall.Beyond that, we get to see the entire cast just being themselves with their personalities shining through pretty well. How much you’ll enjoy that will largely come down to how much of a fan you are of the cast which should be clear enough from the main having watched the main series. There isn’t any major character or relationship development, but they are all still amusing with some solid comedy centered around them too.The art and animation are pretty much the same as the main series but more polished. Overall incredibly similar, but in general the level of quality throughout is about the level the main series was at it’s best so I’d say there’s somewhat of an increase in production values but not a tremendous one. The soundtrack was as far as I can tell the same as the main series. There was a pretty solid insert song near the climax that worked well with hitting the emotional beats involving Lilim. The ED was also decent, though as is the case with most films was just credits on a black background. does provide a quick summary at the beginning for those that may have forgotten.

So did Trinity...Seven Movie: Eternity Library to Alchemic Girl have the same impact?..well...Trinity Seven Movie: Eternity Library to Alchemic Girl\'s plot is extremely bareboned even for an anime movie reaching 55 minutes BUT deducting the 5 minute recap of the anime series and 5 minutes from the credits, it\'s merely 45 MINUTES. The plot for the first half is introducing Lilim voiced by Rina Hidaka, Lililth\'s Grimoire taken human form and thinks Lilith and Arata are her mama and papa and the rest fo the Trinity Seven ogle at how cute Lilim is...THEN our main villain of the movie Lust Trinity voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki attacks and Arata and the Trinity Seven has to defeat him...see what LA meant by this movie being too short. (On a side note, LA found Lust Trinity\'s rivalry to Arata to be similar to Issei Hyodou and Vali Lucifer\'s rivalry in Highschool DxD, heck the similarities goes even further as both rivalries have both characters having the same power (in a sense) duking it out AND even further than that, LA thought that Trinity Seven as a series was like a distant younger cousin of Highschool DxD what with both of it\'s main male protagonist being open-minded perverts along with it\'s excessive fanservice and diving into lore of it\'s world both series go to.)If the movie does have it\'s strengths it\'s comes from it\'s characters and already established lore it had in it\'s anime series allowing for the characters to evolve both in terms of battle and character development in some sense thus more screentime to the Trinity Seven as well as growing Arata in the process of it all, the next is the fact that LA did say the anime series had lackluster battles, but Trinity Seven Movie: Eternity Library to Alchemic Girl battles were a step up from the anime series and although the battles are limited to say the very least, what battles were shown were pretty amazing even for Seven Arc Pictures who also did the anime series. Lastly is the the fact that the stellar soundtrack is back and although slightly remixed it\'s still the same soundtrack which was kinda made the series and to be back for the movie it was a given as well ALSO ZAQ singing the ED ""Last Proof"" only reinforced Trinity Seven\'s impressive soundtrack for the movie. Returning voice actors of this production was back with the new addition of Rina Hidaka as Lilim (in which her loli vocals were decent enough and not-as annoying) but LA\'s favourite voice actors easily goes to Nao Touyama as Lieselotte Sherlock and Ayane Sakura as Levi Kazama by sheer obligation of favourite character of the series (and movie) and best voice actor of the series respectively.AAAAND here LA goes on ranting...LA already pointed out how short this anime movie but like MANY anime movies it falls into the tired and for LA annoying trope of introducing a new character (Lilim) only for that character to disappear and probably never to be remembered again, LA said this during LA\'s Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Cadenza movie review but it just felt almost pointless in getting invested in Lilim as a character as a result and it\'s even more baffling in which Lilim is actually canon to the Trinity Seven manga (LA isn\'t completely sure about this statement, so anyone reading the manga can you PLEASE clarify if this is true or not). The one and only other small flaw LA found from the movie was that due to movie\'s length that the main villain Lust Trinity kinda gets taken rather quickly for a ""White Demon Lord"", hell his DRAGON took more of a fight!...And no, if you think LA would get angry that Lilith as a character took most of the focus from the movie, then LA sees that as misplaced anger due to the waifu wars in Trinity Seven, Trinity Seven Movie: Eternity Library to Alchemic Girl\'s movie is focused Arata and Lilith even before the movie, the anime made it pretty clear it\'s a supporting harem with Lilith as the main girl (this from a person who watched the anime TWICE, once in Dub and has Lieselotte Sherlock as LA\'s favourite character from the series), thus the movie focusing on Lilith and Arata is a no brainer.So, LA poised the question if Trinity Seven Movie: Eternity Library to Alchemic Girl had the same impact as it\'s anime series and to answer that question...by means LA thought it did but slightly better, though the movie did improve in some aspects (the battles and more lore to the Trinity Seven\'s magic etc) but had the same pitfalls and new hurdles that it clumsily went through (like the movie\'s length, Lilim as the new ""movie-only-but not was canon in the manga?"" character and the major villain himself), but nonetheless even with all this mind, the movie did improve and still continued from the anime series with a bit of sequel second season bait?. Trinity Seven Movie: Eternity Library to Alchemic Girl should be a definite for Trinity Seven fans but for the rest......don\'t hold your breathe expecting the movie to have improve drastically from the anime series.

Skippable unless you really want to see Lilim animated.Positives:+ If you liked the original anime series, you'll probably enjoy most of this.  The comedy and fanservice is mostly the same and Arata is still Arata.+ Lilim is mega-cute.Negatives:...- Wastes a good deal of its runtime on fanservice and recaps of the TV series, leaving the rest feeling rushed.  Should have had an extra half hour at least to give the proper amount of build to the central battle of the film.- The battle against the White Demon Lord is so rushed that it lacks any sense of stakes.  This villain is billed as possibly the first real threat to kill Arata, but it doesn't feel that way at all when the battle only lasts about 10 minutes and Arata quickly turns things around after getting his ass handed to him for the first minute or two.- Still has the familiar Trinity Seven problem of having way, way too many characters.  Other than Lilith, basically the entire main cast has become side characters because there are simply too many of them for any to get proper development or satisfying narrative arcs that justify their place in the story. - Wastes a good deal of its runtime on fanservice and recaps of the TV series, leaving the rest feeling rushed.

The rest 10% is some occasional joke, presentation or little final battle.Story:Awful, linear with a dumb villain that was super generic. It tried to be serious but it fails, there were soo many missed opportunities.>The villain could have been a pal of Arata about his pervert ideas and agreeing on what girl has the best body or something, then before dying Yui could have saved him because of empathy for him being asleep so many...years and develop her greed investigation. At least the White Devil could have been a girl that gets distracted by ecchi or something but no, we got the most generic villain in history of anime.The characters stated the obvious continiously and the dialogues were really dull as well, nothing to add to the story of the anime.The final battle was super rushed and short, the characters that come to help add nothing: Hijiri was so dull in fight and in dialogue that you really can't think that she was the driving motivation of the whole show. Her character suffered a lot in this movie.The power scaling also gave story inconsistencies too. How is Hijiri going to defeat Arata in the future if he already uses soo many magic archives as well as achieving Paladin, while she barely survived one attack that also hit 2 other girls as well, but she suffered the most despite being more powerful than the trinity seven.

Her character suffered a lot in this movie.The power scaling also gave story inconsistencies too. How is Hijiri going to defeat Arata in the future if he already uses soo many magic archives as well as achieving Paladin, while she barely survived one attack that also hit 2 other girls as well, but she suffered the most despite being more powerful than the trinity seven.

Sora no Otoshimono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5958/Sora_no_Otoshimono,"[""While watching episode of Sora no Otoshimono, I thought it was going to be a serious fantasy romance-filled action anime. This was because the way the plot was set, and the way Tomoki has his dreams. I really thought it would've been a perfect setting for that type of anime.Then, shit happens. The anime goes totally random and it made me LOL; so hard I almost chocked and spilled soda over my laptop. The humor in Sora no Otoshimono is random, but yet it always seems to make me laugh. The ecchi things stuff tomoki does has yet ceased to bore me.The characters...are also, setup in such perfect proportions for a comedy anime. A perverted boy with his childhood friend, creepy senpai and class prez. Each character has his/her share of randomness to make you laugh.(The humor and story of Sora no Otoshimono, I can't help but say, reminds me of Inukami. They way Yoko punishes Keita is so similar to what happens to tomoki.)Sora no otoshimono is a must watch, if you like this kind of comedy anime. Especially if you like fan service comedy, I guarantee you, you'll laugh your ass off. are also, setup in such perfect proportions for a comedy anime.

Especially if you like fan service comedy, I guarantee you, you'll laugh your ass off."", '*Dramatic ending to an overall ecchi humour series*“The following story depicts the downfall of my quiet and peaceful life.” – Tomoki SakuraiIf someone is telling you this anime has flying pantsu (underwear), what will come to mind? People throwing pantsu at each other? Or if you are a bit more creative, perhaps you may be imagining them using the pantsu to wrap around a volleyball for practice? (I really got that as a response before). But will you believe me if I say the underwear in this show can really fly like a bird (heck, they even fly in a wonderful formation in the sky)....Furthermore, what if those pantsu can explode? Yes, they can go KABOOM! How’s that for a change? Assuming you are still hanging around, let me give this one final piece of advice. Stop reading right here if flying and exploding pantsu is not what you want to see because it only gets much more exciting and chances are you won’t like it (ie. you can drop this show from you list).Now for the rest of us, where should we begin? How about the ordinary lifestyle of the young man, our protagonist of the story, Tomoki Sakurai? All he ever wished from his small town was to live a peaceful and quiet life where he can eat, sleep, and play. He even made a motto for himself, “peace and quiet is the best”. One night under a cherry tree, a pretty angel came falling down toward our hero and that is how his quiet and peaceful life comes to an end. Who might this girl be? Where did she come from? What kind of past did she have? All these questions will propel the story forward and eventually develop into something much more than what anyone would have initially thought possible from this type of show.Unsurprisingly a great deal of character developments, in terms of personal growth, lies with the fallen angel. As the series progresses, she not only begin to show depth as a character, but at the same time get involved in a funny four-way romance. Various characters’ past have also been revealed which explains a lot about their current self, particularly their behavior. This also made them more real and believable as a whole.The sound department really deserves special recognition for this show. Not nothing does it have a special, one of a kind, ending per episode, but each ending also features the aftermath of what happened at the end of the episode (think of it as some form of epilogue). As an example, I strongly urge you to look up the second ending (flying pantsu ending). In addition to the various endings, the unique background music (BGM), that does not often repeat itself, also deserves honourable mention. Often times I feel that I was nearly going in tears thanks to these BGM. They make a strong compliment to the already excellent series.Sounds come in many different forms. Music obviously counts as one, but voicing is another, especially in the anime industry. Some voices can make a character seem like a lifeless zombie or can totally repel viewers from watching further. Others can bring life to a character, making them more lively and believable. Fortunately, Sora no Otoshimono has a large group of talented casts that helped make the characters come to life and also aided the comedy aspect of the show. If I were to select one seiyu from the group whom I believe have performed the best, it will have to be Souichirou Hoshi (Kira from Gundam SEED, Keiichi from Nigurashi no Naku Koro ni). His ultra hilarious performance as Tomoki, the protagonist, played a key role in the overall success of the series in my opinion. Though his voice may be hard to get used to at times, his role as Tomoki is certainly refreshing, highly different from most of his previous character voices.You may think that there is probably nothing else that is good about this series. You are dead wrong. The ultimate selling point of Sora no Otoshimono lies in the animation. While it does not have the unique animation techniques like those we often seen by SHAFT, this series cannot be taken lightly either. Production quality is top notch. With smooth fluid-like animation, great scene transitions, and consistently level of high quality production by the studio, all made this show an eye candy to watch. Of course this is especially true if you are into ecchi-fan service. But even if you are an action fan, you will not be disappointed as the series totally shines with its animation. You have to see it to believe it. Certainly one of the best quality anime (animation-wise) of the Fall 2009 season.To be honest, I am not an extremely big fan of ecchi comedy. But Sora no Otoshimono completely changed my view on this genre. I was really drawn in by the emotional scenes multiple times throughout the series. Similarly, I was also captivated by the very sad, yet powerful, scenes toward the end of the show. It certainly showed us that Sora no Otoshimono is not just about pure ecchi humour, but actually have a strong background story to back it up! I would also like to applaud the production studio, AIC A.S.T.A. for a job well done in adapting the original material from the manga. Lastly if you have read the entire review, do yourself a favour and watch the series now. It is only 13 episodes long, so why not give it a shot? Furthermore, what if those pantsu can explode? Yes, they can go KABOOM! How’s that for a change? Assuming you are still hanging around, let me give this one final piece of advice.

Fortunately however, Sora No Otoshimono is anything but. Surprisingly well done and developed, Sora No Otoshimono takes you on unforgettable ride.StoryThe story at first sounds really generic. Small town, childhood friend who happens to live next door and is well endowed, and a mysterious ""angel"" falling from the sky. Yeah, so it is generic BUT throughout the series, the story gains more depth and eventually becomes interesting and enthralling. As a reader of the manga, the plot follows it to the dot and the pacing is also quite similar. Sometimes...it does feel slightly rushed but keep in mind they are trying to condense about 5 volumes of manga into 13 episodes. The more you delve into the universe the more interesting it gets.AnimationOne word :wowThe animation in this series is flawless. The quality of the animation is simply amazing and this anime isnt even based on action. Animation is smooth and consistent throughout the whole series and camera angles are interesting and dynamic enough to add realism in dialouge. In every scene there is something moving and in most cases it is multiple objects (i.e consistant blinking, arm gestures etc). The bigger scenes that incompass massive explosions and giant crap are also done very nicely. Also, there are always different animations for the credits so there is more new animation packed in every episode.SoundIm not a real expert at sound but there is nothing wrong with the sound in my opinion. Ambience sound are consistant and sound realistic. The voice actors were nicely chosen and all act out their respective characters well. I\'ve heard people say that Tomoko\'s voice (the protagonist) is annoying but i\'ve had no problem with it. Maybe i\'m just tolerant?Since there is always a different credit theme, it means different songs. WOW. Some of them are just plain silly and some are strangely addictive. Also watch out for ep 10, two great songs.CharacterThe character designs are nice and certainly live up to the generic ecchi anime standards. With this in mind however there really isn\'t anything ground breaking when it comes to the characters. Still though, like the plot line there is more than enough character development to keep the series interesting.EnjoymentWho would have thought that an anime with romance, ecchi and comedy as its central genres be so interesting and funny. You\'ll get plenty of laughs here in this series but i warn you, the humour is more on the corny-ecchi side (golden boy) rather the smart ass side (lucky star). Still though, the humour is great and come in great quantities. The extensive use of chibi characters really make the irony in the ""serious"" scene unbearable.However thats not to say that the plot line is completely neglected with somewhat cheap humour. As a reader of the manga where this series is based on, the plot is actually quite deep and meaningful. Its really the polar opposite of the humour found in this series. Throughout the series both humour and plot development are nicely balanced so that viewers of the anime are satisfied in both ecchi and plotline values.ConclusionAn anime that probably has the highest production value of the season (and dare i say the year), a deep plot and truckloads of humour, this anime cannot be missed. Seemingly neglescted due to its appearance as a ""generic"", this anime is anything but.

However, the humor usually falls flat with me, and the ecchi is rather tame by my standards and doesn\'t have the situational elements that makes ecchi sexy. And there isn\'t much else to save the show. The story doesn\'t really matter much. It serves more as a premise for the 2 ""angeloid"" girls rather than a key component of most episodes. In other words, it\'s mostly episodic.Comedy: The comedy is wild and exaggerated, using gags, slapstick, and parodies. And it\'s corny. It reminds me a bit of a Looney Toons cartoon. The main male...character, Tomoki, is uncontrollably perverted, and the comedy mostly consists of him coming up with plots to see women naked or in panties, and getting beat up in the process. He is shown 90% of the time in chibi form (the small child-like form) with a totally different voice, and almost half of that time he is running around naked. In fact, I almost don\'t recognize him when he switches back. I just don\'t find this type of dumb comedy appealing.Ecchi: I\'m a fan of ecchi, but I do find mindless ecchi boring. There needs to be some situational element to make the ecchi sexy and appealing, like a romantic build-up, an awkward situation, or some cuteness. Some of the panty shots involving Sohara early on in the series are quite nice as she shakes her butt around cutely while talking. The brief shot of the girls putting on kimonos was nice too. There was some romance there too, where Sohara developed some affection for the hero as he saved her. But then from about the 4th episode on, any of this romantic/cute ecchi ceases to exist. Instead, it\'s all brute-force mindless, emotionless ecchi as Tomoki barges in on girls to catch a peek. With no situational element, it\'s about as sexy as looking at a department store swimsuit catalog.So with the comedy and ecchi elements being lackluster, and the story being more of background element (and this story being a bit shallow and undeveloped) Sora no Otoshimono fails to deliver. It\'s watchable as mild entertainment, but I wouldn\'t regret having not seen it. character, Tomoki, is uncontrollably perverted, and the comedy mostly consists of him coming up with plots to see women naked or in panties, and getting beat up in the process.

But aside from all the semi-nudity and ecchi nature of this anime, it is really quite enjoyable. I started off thinking that this would be like any other rom-com anime and it would be mostly fan service. Im not saying there isn't any because they go to the bathhouse, the beach, the water park, and anywhere that you can see lots of boobies.Story(7/10): The anime doesn't entirely focus on a story driven plot but it doesn't mean it is deprived of a story.

Silly, pretty graphics that are fanservice oriented, weak plot and character development?  SnO is certainly a very lighthearted show for the most part, and easily enjoyable for those who appreciate comedy in general. This doesn\'t mean that SnO fundamentally lacks the qualities of a good, interesting, and solid show.Arguably the biggest ""flaw"" of the show is that the story premise is as generic as it gets, with the tried and true concept of the boy who meets a magical girl (or angel in this case) who is able to do amazing...this for him, which we already know from shows like Chobits and Oh My Goddess. The question that must be asked is what is done to remix this old idea? In this case, I\'d have to analyze the main character Tomoki. At first glance, he\'s a rather obnoxious and lazy pervert who merely wishes to live a quiet peaceful life. As events progress, we see more from him, how he\'s actually quite capable and motivated to help others around him who are in need. Tomoki\'s development towards becoming more sensitive to the people around him so far makes him, and this show stand out. Meanwhile, the time Tomoki loses from his ""quiet peaceful life"" that is spent caring for the angel Ikaros has contributed to her development in learning about the human world, and developing her emotions for those around her.The aforementioned development of the main characters is quite well done, and moving. Even though Tomoki\'s shenanigans and Ikaros\'s naivety of the human world and her appealing design opens up many opportunities for the ""ecchi comedy"" part of this anime to take form, the ""romance"" part of this anime is generally done quite seriously, with characters taking time to reflect on events around them, not mention taking time to also explain their background, which really adds depth to the characters themselves and their emotions for one another, particularly concerning Tomoki\'s friend Sohara and of course the angel Ikaros.As I was saying how Ikaros\'s design is quite appealing, the artwork in this show is extremely well done.  Characters are well-drawn in general, and the use of chibi forms of these characters in comedy moments is done quite appropriately. Animations are also really high quality and diverse, and the choice of music is very catchy and appropriate. The quality of the aesthetics in general is very impressive, and a reason alone for watching this show. What is also quite interesting about this show is how there is always a different theme and scene used for the ending of each episode, so I would recommend not skipping the credits of this show.All in all, SnO is a great show, and probably one of the highest quality productions of Fall 2009. This show is definitely for you if you want something that looks nice, is very funny, and has interesting development. The development of this show is so interesting that I\'m concerned that 13 episodes is not enough to do this show justice.

However, this series is pretty good. In all honesty, it would probably turn off many, and draw in others. It's full of typical Japanese ecchi humor, which isn't bad if you're not a prude, a bit of a harem theme going but not in your face about it, and an overall feel-good story. It borders on sci-fi and fantasy, although that part of the story isn't fully explained. The focus of the series seems to be on the characters' interactions with the main character. There doesn't seem to be much...background plot or direction to the story beyond these interactions. One thing I didn't like was that these interactions became a bit repetitive with each subsequent addition of a new character. The series only has 2 seasons, so it didn't get too drawn out like how extremely long series sometimes constantly reuse the same formula.I would recommend this series if you want some laughs and aren't looking for something serious. You would like it even more, if you are into fan service, or are male. If you hate harem and ecchi themes, then you may want to avoid it. The series seemed to be made just for me, so I am giving it a 9 overall. background plot or direction to the story beyond these interactions. One thing I didn't like was that these interactions became a bit repetitive with each subsequent addition of a new character.

This is my first review on this site and i really wanted to talk about my disappointment for this anime to someone and what better place than on myanimelist.comHello everyone! This is your guy, HogisGuy. And i\'m here with my first ever written review. I decided to write this review because i\'ve never been this disappointed of an anime ever but boy have i got a lot (And i mean...A LOT) of hate for my opinion on this series but i hope that you\'ll hear me out.The first thing i wanna talk about is the story... wait! What story?!! Oh yeah! There was something about an angel from some a*****es in heaven. I totally forgot because i was so busy laughing at Tomoki\'s crazy and hilarious shenanigans (if you can\'t tell, I\'m being sarcastic). Seriously, sometime i forgot that Ikaros really was an angel and thought she was a casual cosplayer or something. It seems like this anime was more busy showing us boring ecchi scenes and those many non-funny scenes with Tomoki and that it probably thought that we would get bored if they didn\'t show us more ecchi scenes and keep the actual plot at 45 seconds per episode. And even then the story itself wasn\'t that great but at least a hundred times more interesting than the other garbage they threw at us in the series. Though i will admit that i did laugh at some jokes there were a lot more jokes that just fell flat on it\'s own face and just died. It also feels like this anime didn\'t have any idea what audience it wanted to entertain. The comedy crowd? The drama crowd?! The perv crowd?!! I don\'t know and i have a feeling they didn\'t either.The art and animations was really good and even beautiful at times. The designs on the characters was well done and i enjoyed the art style in every single scene (except for the ""HILARIOUS"" nipple-song scene).Characters... OH JOY!! I\'ll start and finish it all with the poor excuse of a protagonist, Tomoki. Let me quote something from the book ""I have no mouth, and i must scream"" to describe what i feel for Tomoki... if i was a machine:“HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I\'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.”I HATE Tomoki! He is not funny! He is not deep! He is not interesting! He is nothing! I would love to know who decided for this thing to be the protagonist of the series so i could slam his/her head into the wall and scream ""Why?!!"" into his ear over and over again. Tomoki doesn\'t contribute with anything to the series. I love how the anime is constantly trying to make me believe that he is important in this anime when the most common problems he runs into is following:1: How can i sneak into the girls locker room?2: I can\'t afford this porno magazine? Well in all my years. I guess i have to work for some cash then.3: How are we ever going to get those panties back on Sohara. What a pickle!4: What\'s that Ikaros? You wanna move the plot forward? Hah! That\'s funny but seriously though, how can i sneak into the girls locker room?!!5: Are you sure that transforming me into a girl is gonna get me inside the girls locker room?You got a beautiful angel that will do ANYTHING for you! And if any of you people say he doesn\'t do anything with her because he\'s deep and emotional and would never take advantage of a woman like that. Yeah i think it\'s kinda too late to convince me that when i just saw him grope two women. You know what? Sugata is the better protagonist for the series. Yes i know that he too got some weird fantasies, playing around with dolls but here\'s the thing! He (unlike our villain ""Tomoki"") actually gets some s**t done. He researches the angels and seems to be more understanding and interested about them and want\'s to know more of their world. What does Tomoki do? ... He writes songs about his nipples. CHARMING!I want to give this anime a lower score because giving it an overall score of four makes me feel dirty but the thing is that this anime isn\'t poor. Because when you get to the good parts and especially the last few episodes i was really invested and found it even sad for what poor Nymph had to go through to get Ikaros home. I have nothing against Ecchi animes or mangas, hell i even love them but when you focus on it too much to the point where it gets in the way of the story you have to realize that it\'s going to wear out fast. I actually love Manyuu Hikencho and High School Of The Dead.- But HogisGuy!! HOTD has breasts and unnecessary panty shots. And Manyuu Hikencho is just naked breasts through the whole series.Sure. HOTD has a lot of pointless ecchi scenes but they are out of the scenes as fast as they are in and yes, they do get boring at times with those panty shots but it never loses track of it\'s story and even has time for good character build-ups except for Shizuka who is totally pointless to the show and manga so far. Manyuu Hikencho\'s story revolves around big breasts. You can find it funny, you can find it hot. I see it as a hilarious and to be honest, a good story for it\'s ludicrous world and that\'s something this series gets right unlike Sora No Otoshimono.Now then, i don\'t hate Sora No Otoshimono. I just don\'t think it was as good as some people tried to make it out be. Here\'s to the second season being better but i have my doubts.

I just don\'t think it was as good as some people tried to make it out be. Here\'s to the second season being better but i have my doubts.', '\'Sora no Otoshimono\' was an extremely pleasant and thrilling experience. In the supernatural genre, this anime is in a league of its own. If you\'re not a fan of ecchi or history though, turn away now.The premise of this anime might appear banal at first. A guy named Tomoki Sakurai is your average laid-back pervert, spending his days sitting around and doing nothing in particular in between bouts of looking up girls\' skirts. One day an angel comes crashing down on his peaceful village and all hell breaks lose. You\'d think this idea wouldn\'t work and half-way through this series I still couldn\'t figure...out where this anime was trying to go with its plot. It gets a lot better later as the ecchines and general silliness subsides and paves way for a philosophical,  mythological and emotionaly disstressing second half of the series. The transition is slow and nearly unnoticable, even if you went on anime watching marathon and decided to see this series in one sitting. It\'s absolutely amazing how well this has been pulled off and what\'s even more amazing is that it makes this series unique, in a positive way.The whole concept of ""angeloids"" will take you by suprise because you will most likely be thinking about normal folklore-based angels with varying magical powers. Nope. I won\'t spoil this series for you so I\'m only going to say that nearly every idea pertaining to angels here has been invented from scratch. At the same time however the main theme of the plot is that of a \'new world\' which is closely based on the European age of discovery and colonisation.  Every episode begins with a history lesson and there are tons, and I mean tons of mythological and historical references in here. You\'ll learn a lot watching this anime.The characters may appear shallow at the very begining but that won\'t be the case as the story progresses. The male lead, Tomoki is a pervert like no other. I can\'t even compare him to other male anime characters because he sets the bar so high in terms of pervertedness that no other character comes anywhere close to it. If there\'s an opportunity to do something lewd this guy will jump in to take advatage of it, without hesitation. That said, he cares deeply about his friends and is a central figure around which most of the events unravel. He\'s pivotal to the well-being of his circle of friends.Ikaros is an angel sent down to assist Tomoki in... well pretty much everything. And Tomoki being a lewd sleaze that he is, takes full advantage of that. Ikaros however plays a much bigger role in this anime helping it to convey the ideas of freedom, discovery and... love. She\'s also linked to several historical and mythological events. Even her name is based on a mythological person.Nymph is an another angeloid and her role in the series is to show the viewer that serfdom can be sometimes cruel. An important issue to be sure but this character was not given enough time and the series could have done better in terms of her development. Even though she\'s a tsundere-type character, she is very similar to Ikaros and at times I had the impression that she was nothing more than her different-looking clone.Then we have Tomoki\'s classmates. An eccentric and totally insane genius (a bit cliche but that didn\'t bother me) Eishirou Sugata. His academic and anecdotal knowledge is impressive and his goal is to discover the \'new world\', the one angeloids are coming from. He acts as a mentor/teacher to the rest of the characters often guiding them in their actions. We then have the buxom Mitsuki Sohara, Tomoki\'s childhood friend who usually karate chops the hell out of him when he\'s being perverted - a running gag throughout the series. Her presence is somewhat vital to the plot but I couldn\'t put my finger on it. Perhaps she just fits in with the rest of the cast and without her this series would not be complete. And then we have the spine-chilling Mikako Satsukitane, Tomoki\'s class president who has the knack of turning peaceful town-folk into vicious killing machines. I don\'t know what\'s going on in her head at any given time, but it\'s not flowers and birds I can tell you that much.Now then with the story and characters discussed, let\'s move on to art and sound. I could simply say that they\'re both jaw-dropping. And they are but let\'s elaborate a little.The art is flawless, I couldn\'t see a single mistake in any of the 13 episodes I\'ve watched. Moreover, the art is precise to the core. Even the smallest features have been drawn with accuracy and precision. I\'m talking about movie-grade precision. At times you don\'t want to believe that you\'re actually watching a TV series. FUNimation and AIC A.S.T.A have done a great job here.Now this is where my review might get a little biased. I personally love classical, baroque and late medieval music and this anime features plenty of that type of music. However, I could not see this anime working without any other type of music. Phililosophical and mythological themes call for a classical soundtrack so my personal preferences here don\'t make that much of a difference. That said, this series\' soundtrack also features modern anime style pieces of music so I suppose everyone\'s going to be pleased.Enjoyment. Bah, I haven\'t been this intrugued and thrilled since I watched \'Death Note\'. Seriously, the first few episodes might give you the wrong idea but it gets better as the series progresses. You\'ll not only have fun but you will also be genuinely interested in the story and you\'ll want to know more at all costs!\'Sora no Otoshimono\' is a masterpiece. 10 points. out where this anime was trying to go with its plot.

With sexualizing  all the female character with big breast or all the female characters just fighting for the same guy, without the guy not knowing anything.-Sora No Otoshimono or Heaven's Lost Property whichever you would like to call it; starts with the Protagonist name Tomaki Sakurai a perverted high school boy that somehow he wants to live a peaceful life. Later finds a Pink haired girl, Angle/Angleoids falling from the sky, maned Ikaros becoming somewhat his servant.The show is pretty much based on the life of Tomaki Sakurai...and how he had to deal with his new life, with Ikaros flying around following him. Throughout the show, each episode isn't really connected to each other you'll see random anime change the comedy would make you laugh and you don't really care about other than Tomaki and Ikaros big breast, and more by putting does things aside is really enjoyable, the story-line is kinda weak, and Tomaki pervaded gets kinda annoying after awhile and breast popping all over the place but by following it and waiting until the credit scene of the episodes everything makes sense (kinda) and realize why the reason Ikaros is doing on in the fist place.Later on the series, more Angles/Angleoids would appear you'll find yourself loving them more then the humans companion that you'll meet in the process.Protagonist/Characters-Tomoki: Is the obvious Perverted High School boy, that everyone loves and cares, about his friends, and is hard to see him as a serious Hero unlike other anime.-Ikaros: Is the Angle/Angleoid that Tomaki meets in the first two episodes, she bow to be Tomaki servant. With no real reason and follow Tomaki perverted schemes with no questions, later she finds herself loving Tomaki, without him not notice him, like any other protagonist  but not able to show emotions she has a hard time showing it, nor she smiles. But shows destructive anger if Tomaki is in any kinda danger. You'll find yourself for some weird reason wanting Ikaros to tell Tomoki how she feels. hahaha-Sohara: Is the next door neighbor and child hood friend, of Tomoki she also the typical girl that loves the protagonist having perverted dreams about him. But instead she keeps it and beats, Tomoki every time he gets any close contact with any other girl, always putting her nose where it doesn't belong.*There more characters that you would meet, while the series goes on*Really recommended if you want to have a good laugh you would enjoy watching it, and somehow you would be able to connect with them... Hope this help :)-Jorvaldez12 and how he had to deal with his new life, with Ikaros flying around following him.

Hope this help :)-Jorvaldez12"", 'The ""Magical Girlfriend"" genre is one that\'s been around long before anime became mainstream. Shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie being prime examples. However, the series that made Magical Girlfriends a popular theme in anime would be ""Ah! My Goddess"". A charming, feel good show that has become a pretty big influence in the industry. Being a template for other similar titles like Chobits, Please Teacher!, Mahoromatic, Sekirei, and many others. Though with every good attempt at a magical girlfriend anime, there\'s always those poor attempts that are so horrible, that it makes the others I\'ve mentioned feel bad about themselves. And by...far, the ABSOLUTE, WORST magical girlfriend show to EVER disgrace the genre.......is Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan. But Heaven\'s Lost Property comes in a close second! And heres why.The Story (If you can call it that) (2/10)Tomoki Sakurai is this little punk ass who\'s been having the same dream he\'s been having ever since he was young. One his friends Sugata believes it to be a new world. However, Tomoki and his circle of friends have their lives change forever with the arrival of Ikaros. An angeloid who feel out of the sky and became Tomoki\'s master. Sparking a series of really perverted misadventures.So as you can tell, this is a very familiar set up that\'s been done several times before. Examples I\'ve already listed. But is it at least done well? OH HELL NO! Almost every episode is filled with plot holes and continuity errors, and the ""romance"" elements are poorly executed. Not to mention that it\'s VERY inconsistent with how angeloids work and function. I can honestly blame all of this on the shows usage of fanservice! Look, I don\'t mind fanservice in an anime as long as it\'s not overused and it doesn\'t take up the majority of it. Examples I can think of are ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", ""A Certain Scientific Railgun"", and for a magical girlfriend example, ""Ah! My Goddess"". The problem in this case is that this series focusses WAY to much on the service, and seems to mostly care about giving male watchers erections, that the quality of everything else turns out horribly! And what makes it worse that it can be considered an excuse to give Tomoki perverted reactions to them. Who by the way, has to be the WORST male protagonist I\'ve ever seen. But will get to him later.So if you\'re looking for a deep, feel good romance anime, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!The Dub (6/10).....It just baffles me how this awful series would have a very good cast of voice actors for it\'s dub. I mean, it has the likes of Greg Ayres, Brittney Karbowski, Eric Vale, Jamie Marchi, Alison Vikorin, Mike McFarland, and Trina Nishimura. These people are very good at what they do! Some of which did voices for some of my all time favorite characters......so HOW they saw potential in this series I\'ll never know. I\'m surprised that the women who did the voices for the female characters didn\'t feel insulted by how this show treats and objectifies women. You could argue that they might be use to it considering they\'ve working on ecchi animes before, but if I was a voice actress, and was offered to work on something like this, I would feel disgusted and decline in a snap! But you know what pisses me off the most, is that there are other animes that are considered masterpieces, or at least fan favorites, they have yet get dubbed for the american market. And yet animes like Heaven\'s Lost Property get dubs about a year after the first season finishes airing. It REALLY boggles the mind.The Characters (2/10)Now I talk about what I think is the animes lowest point. And what better way to start, but with the main protagonist of the show, Tomoki. This prick has to be the WORST male protagonist I\'ve ever seen, period! A lot of the time he\'s just being a no good pervert towards his friends and many of the background girls, and has very little respect for them! Now I just know that fanboys will try defending him by saying he does have his moments where he\'s nice towards the other characters, but he suffer the same problem as Louise the Zero! Any sense of character development that he\'ll get will be thrown out the window by the next episode, making that nice moment he had completely insincere. And don\'t get me started on his treatment to the other main characters. Speaking of which....Ikaros was just.....boring. She\'s just your typical emotionless girl. Now I don\'t mind coming across this archetype more than once, as long as there\'s a good variation of it. Just take a look at Yuki Nagato, or Ennis from Baccano!. They were great emotionless girls. But Ikaros has nothing unique to her character, and just comes across as a downgraded version of Ren from DearS. Plus, this anime does a terrible job at being consistent with the fact that she\'s an android from heaven, since that fact doesn\'t stop her from eating food, shedding a tear every now and then, and so forth. Nymth, I\'ll admit was one of the two likable characters of this show. She did have a tragic backstory and her calling Tomoki an ""insect"" is another plus. Sohara I did pity over her treatment she gets from Tomoki.....until I discovered a disturbing fact about her, that makes her looks like a masochist. Now these main girls are somewhat tolerable, but what makes them unlikable to a certain extent is that they REALLY have no valid reasons to be in love with that asshole. Since he\'s guilty of the following.1. Hitting Ikaros and talking down to her whenever she screws up with something.2. Puts Nymth down for having a flat chest. (Cause yeah, that\'s REALLY an important feature for a girl to have. *Sarcasm*)3. Peeps at Sohara changing from next door, as well as stealing her underwear. Not to mention that once he broke into her house during her birthday, ate some cake without asking, and gave her something his grandpa gave him as a birthday present. Yeah, SOME friend you are Tomoki.There are two more characters I need to talk about, which are Sugata and Mikako. Now Sugata I\'ll admit was pretty bearable, since he does have a nice personality and wants to help people. If anything, HE should\'ve been the main protagonist instead. Mikako.......scares the crap out of me. Seriously....something is wrong with her. You just have to see for yourself. But anyways, there are two likable characters, but they aren\'t enough to save this atrocious cast, lead by that perverted bastard.The Music (5/10)The music was.....okay. But that isn\'t saying much. The opening theme isn\'t that memorable, and the ending theme.....actually, there\'s a different one for each episode. This may sound like a nitpick, but I\'m use to animes that would have either one or two ending themes, as well as one or two opening themes. I just see no point in giving an episode a completely different ending theme. Because it feels more like an excuse to have even more ecchi fanservice to the running time. As if we had ENOUGH of that already!Overall (2/10)In conclusion, Heaven\'s Lost Property is easily one of the worst animes I\'ve ever seen in my life. As well as a complete insult to the ""Magical Girlfriend"" anime. The storytelling is poorer than Oliver Twist, the main character is a hateful perverted scumbag, and most of the other characters are either forgettable, poorly written, or both. There really is little to like about this awful anime. If you want a GOOD ""Magical Girlfriend"" anime, watch Ah! My Goddess, Chobits, and even Please Teacher! They\'re more worth your time than this poor attempt at being in their crowd. far, the ABSOLUTE, WORST magical girlfriend show to EVER disgrace the genre.......is Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan. But Heaven\'s Lost Property comes in a close second! And heres why.The Story (If you can call it that) (2/10)Tomoki Sakurai is this little punk ass who\'s been having the same dream he\'s been having ever since he was young. One his friends Sugata believes it to be a new world. However, Tomoki and his circle of friends have their lives change forever with the arrival of Ikaros. An angeloid who feel out of the sky and became Tomoki\'s master. Sparking a series of really perverted misadventures.So as you can tell, this is a very familiar set up that\'s been done several times before. Examples I\'ve already listed. But is it at least done well? OH HELL NO! Almost every episode is filled with plot holes and continuity errors, and the ""romance"" elements are poorly executed. Not to mention that it\'s VERY inconsistent with how angeloids work and function. I can honestly blame all of this on the shows usage of fanservice! Look, I don\'t mind fanservice in an anime as long as it\'s not overused and it doesn\'t take up the majority of it. Examples I can think of are ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", ""A Certain Scientific Railgun"", and for a magical girlfriend example, ""Ah! My Goddess"". The problem in this case is that this series focusses WAY to much on the service, and seems to mostly care about giving male watchers erections, that the quality of everything else turns out horribly! And what makes it worse that it can be considered an excuse to give Tomoki perverted reactions to them. Who by the way, has to be the WORST male protagonist I\'ve ever seen. But will get to him later.So if you\'re looking for a deep, feel good romance anime, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!The Dub (6/10).....It just baffles me how this awful series would have a very good cast of voice actors for it\'s dub. I mean, it has the likes of Greg Ayres, Brittney Karbowski, Eric Vale, Jamie Marchi, Alison Vikorin, Mike McFarland, and Trina Nishimura. These people are very good at what they do! Some of which did voices for some of my all time favorite characters......so HOW they saw potential in this series I\'ll never know. I\'m surprised that the women who did the voices for the female characters didn\'t feel insulted by how this show treats and objectifies women. You could argue that they might be use to it considering they\'ve working on ecchi animes before, but if I was a voice actress, and was offered to work on something like this, I would feel disgusted and decline in a snap! But you know what pisses me off the most, is that there are other animes that are considered masterpieces, or at least fan favorites, they have yet get dubbed for the american market. And yet animes like Heaven\'s Lost Property get dubs about a year after the first season finishes airing. It REALLY boggles the mind.The Characters (2/10)Now I talk about what I think is the animes lowest point. And what better way to start, but with the main protagonist of the show, Tomoki. This prick has to be the WORST male protagonist I\'ve ever seen, period! A lot of the time he\'s just being a no good pervert towards his friends and many of the background girls, and has very little respect for them! Now I just know that fanboys will try defending him by saying he does have his moments where he\'s nice towards the other characters, but he suffer the same problem as Louise the Zero! Any sense of character development that he\'ll get will be thrown out the window by the next episode, making that nice moment he had completely insincere. And don\'t get me started on his treatment to the other main characters. Speaking of which....Ikaros was just.....boring. She\'s just your typical emotionless girl. Now I don\'t mind coming across this archetype more than once, as long as there\'s a good variation of it. Just take a look at Yuki Nagato, or Ennis from Baccano!. They were great emotionless girls. But Ikaros has nothing unique to her character, and just comes across as a downgraded version of Ren from DearS. Plus, this anime does a terrible job at being consistent with the fact that she\'s an android from heaven, since that fact doesn\'t stop her from eating food, shedding a tear every now and then, and so forth. Nymth, I\'ll admit was one of the two likable characters of this show. She did have a tragic backstory and her calling Tomoki an ""insect"" is another plus. Sohara I did pity over her treatment she gets from Tomoki.....until I discovered a disturbing fact about her, that makes her looks like a masochist. Now these main girls are somewhat tolerable, but what makes them unlikable to a certain extent is that they REALLY have no valid reasons to be in love with that asshole. Since he\'s guilty of the following.1. Hitting Ikaros and talking down to her whenever she screws up with something.2. Puts Nymth down for having a flat chest. (Cause yeah, that\'s REALLY an important feature for a girl to have. *Sarcasm*)3. Peeps at Sohara changing from next door, as well as stealing her underwear. Not to mention that once he broke into her house during her birthday, ate some cake without asking, and gave her something his grandpa gave him as a birthday present. Yeah, SOME friend you are Tomoki.There are two more characters I need to talk about, which are Sugata and Mikako. Now Sugata I\'ll admit was pretty bearable, since he does have a nice personality and wants to help people. If anything, HE should\'ve been the main protagonist instead. Mikako.......scares the crap out of me. Seriously....something is wrong with her. You just have to see for yourself. But anyways, there are two likable characters, but they aren\'t enough to save this atrocious cast, lead by that perverted bastard.The Music (5/10)The music was.....okay. But that isn\'t saying much. The opening theme isn\'t that memorable, and the ending theme.....actually, there\'s a different one for each episode. This may sound like a nitpick, but I\'m use to animes that would have either one or two ending themes, as well as one or two opening themes. I just see no point in giving an episode a completely different ending theme. Because it feels more like an excuse to have even more ecchi fanservice to the running time.

There really is little to like about this awful anime. If you want a GOOD ""Magical Girlfriend"" anime, watch Ah! My Goddess, Chobits, and even Please Teacher! They\'re more worth your time than this poor attempt at being in their crowd.', ""There really isn't anything that special about this anime. It's your typical ecchi comedy where all the girls have big boobs and the guys keep getting nose bleeds. However, I'd still recommend watching this anime because it's fairly short so if you wanted to you could knock it out in a few days, it always put a smile on my face when I watched it, and there are some actually dramatic moments in it.This anime's best quality is how much personality each character has. Of course, this anime isn't as serious as Full Metal Alchemist so it isn't like every character has this complex reason...for their actions, but I love how much emotion each character shows and how every character contributes to the show in their own way. For example, Mikako is kind of the shows antagonist and she loves anything involving other people getting hurt like if she sees two people disagreeing her solution is for the two to have a dual to the death and whoever lives is right.Like many anime comedies, there's a hint of romance in this anime, but it's interesting how the romance develops. Tomoki and Ikaros don't really fall in love so much as Tomoki teaches Ikaros what love is. Ikaros is such an innocent character and so oblivious to basic emotions she has a tough time grasping the concept of love so she becomes confused when she feels it. Most of the serious traits in the anime are eclipsed by all the comedic moments, but I can still see how Ikaros changes on the inside as the anime progresses.Now, the biggest problem with this anime is how there are way too many pervert jokes! Seriously, every episode has to have Tomoki trying to look up a girl's skirt or molesting someone. It gets old after a while and I'm just happy this anime's short because I don't think I could watch even 50 episodes of it before I'd throw in the towel.Overall: This is a pretty funny comedy to watch even though the jokes do get a little old at the end. There's a pretty descent romantic element to it and, of course, tons of magic. The story is almost non-existent, but the characters are truly this anime's best quality. for their actions, but I love how much emotion each character shows and how every character contributes to the show in their own way.

You should watch it am sure you will love it unless you are a kind of gloomy,shady person who enjoys dark sad anime. WATCH IT NOW!! "", 'Ok, 1st time typing review, don\'t blame for my poor grammar and vocab...Well, Actually it has quite a Good Start ahead with the story, A boy with a weird ever-happening dream making A suspense and then beautiful angel appears. It\'s kinda of anyone\'s dream when they were kids.And, Well the characters designs are quite OK and viewer-friendly, big eyes (not that all 1-color-highlighted eye or simple neko eyes), Cute and chubby facial shapes and the setting for the character is quite different but to their own charms and good features. And, btw the wings, battle suits are quite pretty as well.......Ok, for the VA, yup they have succeeded to make one\'s character appealing and much lively, (Nice) well, my favourite character is Ikaros(female MC) and she sang OP and some ED of this anime along with Bluedrops ( her voice is sweet - Saori Hayami)And, what is great about this anime is the randomness , the creativeness of ecchi pantsu jokes and pranks and collaborating with some serious events and feels.Well, not that i boast about myself, I can understand average things quite clearly and this anime really is easy to read, suitable for leisure or as a side-dish combo with other strong-taste anime.Well Rome doesn\'t built in one day, so does this, try to collect small events, hints and stuffs in it then you will feel what it wanna give to you, just a reminder"" don\'t watch it all for Pantsu and Oppai, watch the Overall, I am sure it worth your time, well i have watched it thrice though....

HahahaEnjoy ~~~', '***SPOILER ALERT!!!***From here on, I\'m not paying attention to how much I could spoil, but I may spoil some things on the way; you have been warned. (Now that I\'ve read it though, it looks like I\'ve only spoiled minor things...)Alright, first off, let me say that this will be my first review and I do not mean to offend anyone with my comments.  I am expressing my opinion and I hope you will respect my opinion as I promise to respect yours, as well.This anime was one of the first ones I heard of through the internet, back when I first started...to watch anime, and when I watched it, I had high expectations for it because everyone else seemed to really love it and give it good reviews!  I really, really, want to say that I like it but I just can\'t... It wasn\'t something that was torture to watch, but I didn\'t enjoy it too much, either.I gave the story a 5/10 here.  Man, what can I say? The first episode, as usual, started off with a decent enough story, in which the female lead, Icarus, makes a ""sudden"" and ""surprising"" entrance and meets the stunned male lead, Tomoki; veeery original.  But any hint of a story is always swallowed up by the filler-esque humor.  For every three episodes, one might progress the story.  But unfortunately, everything turns out to be bland and predictable, right down to the characters\' actions, but I\'ll get to that later. The only time story can be squeezed in is when Tomoki shuts his big damn mouth, which hardly ever happens...>_> An attempt was made, no doubt, for there to be a nice story, but story-wise, this anime just falls flat...I can\'t say I enjoyed the story until the latter half of the anime, in which a bit more happened.  But the plot is nothing new, special, or surprising, and the story that the humor is based around all feels forced; trapped on an island, the beach episode, new girls go to the school, the festival, and the last episode, in which the male lead gets mini speeches from his friends, and gives the mini-speech about friendship to the heroine and the power of love wins against the baddies!The art gets an 8/10 here.  Its not ground-breaking, but its pretty enough, the animation is fluid, and there are no awkward animation moments to note.  Not much to say here except that I despise the way that the characters, ESPECIALLY Tomoki, are chibi-fied at the drop of a hat. The animation is the part I enjoyed the most, but it wasn\'t a great reason to watch the anime.The sound gets a 6/10, because although I liked the OP, the OST\'s weren\'t anything special.  How should I put it.....I don\'t think the sound was bad.  It\'s just something that enhanced the experience and there were no problems; pretty average. I don\'t like how in the last few episodes, they shoved sound effects into the OP, as if they wanted something different and were too lazy to make a parodied OP or something along the lines of that...As they say, ""Do not fix what is not broken"".  For the ED, I can\'t really say if I liked the fact that each episode had a different ending song... Some might like it, but I prefer one OP and one ED.  But hey, that\'s just me.Character...Oh boy, where to start?...OK, lets start with Tomoki.For the ""strange dreams"" he had with the angel introduced in the first episode, I was hoping to see more, because that could have really helped the plot, but it was only referred to about once or twice more, and ended up as something to put in his character description to make him ""special""...Well, let me say, if MAL had a least favorite character list, he would definitely be in it! All he does is scream out obvious things, make disturbing noises, act frustrated, and talk about being human once in a while. After 13 episodes of his ANNOYING voice (all I hear is the sound of a boy with voice changes going ""Huhuhuhuhuhuhu-uuuu-uuu..."") that makes me want to stab soft furry things, his not-cute chibi that substitutes for him 70% of the time, and the little wing covering up his private parts, I want to push him into a volcano and watch him burn slowly. >:D  The worst part is, the girls in his harem love him for the 5% of the time when he makes a serious face and talks about human feelings...the rest of the time, he\'s being a purposely perverted pubescent pervert.  (Sorry, I couldn\'t resist XD)  I can\'t think of any worse shounen leads... my favorite part is when he becomes a girl and has a different damn VOICE.  I find ecchi situations more funny when they\'re by accident, and the lead isn\'t agressively trying to peep, but there\'s no such thing here; no sir!  Tomoki is just  a vicious pervert and I don\'t see what everyone sees in him...He\'s  just a peeping Tomoki. *snicker* Seriously, this series is just overusing that joke, and now it\'s a dead horse.While I\'m on the subject of overused, let me start on the other characters, which are all recycled.  First, Sohara, the clingy, jealous, childhood friend, a harem favorite.  Another harem favorite, the abused and tsundere-ish loli, Nymph.  She wasn\'t that bad, in fact, she was one of my main reasons for watching Sora no Otoshimono because she\'s so cute.  Yeah, she wasn\'t horrible; she and Icarus were the only ones with character development in the anime.  Icarus was fairly decent and I liked the watermelon theme for her for some reason.  It was a nice touch, but still not enough to save the show from Tomoki...>:I In the end, she is one of the better ones, but she is still the ""emotionless girl"" with limited addition to the character\'s background.  She was predictable all the time; for example, with the episode in which she\'s in the band, I knew right away that she would sing, if only for the sake of the fans.  Speaking of background, we have Sugata and Mikako, the slapped-on characters used to ""round off"" the cast.  It\'s like, they\'re just there...to be there. Yes, each episode starts off with a history lecture from Sugata; some were funny but most were annoying or boring.  He\'s just that ""epic smart guy with glasses that he pushes up his nose who points out conspiracies"". I have no problem with that, it\'s just that his character feels out of place in the genre, and would fit in better in Sci-Fi or something that has conspiracies to reveal.  Mikako is just another sadistic ""kind"" girl, but I only laughed at the character a few times, as she also felt out-of-place.  But what made them feel most tacked-on is the fact that they both start out knowing everyone, but it is never explained how any of them met each other. At least in Sohara\'s case, there was a brief and decent explanation as to how she met Tomoki.The characters get a 4/10 and I hope you understand why I selected this score. ^~^Last but not least, the comedy. This anime is 90% slapstick humor and virtually all of the humor involves Tomoki being perverted.  ""Tomoki runs around naked after seeing naked girls because he is about to get hurt""  pretty much sums it up.  I was never a fan of slapstick humor, and it\'s not that funny when it\'s the same situation over and over again.  Slapstick humor is best sprinkled on like a seasoning for the events that lead to it; events that are different! Take the anime ""Nichijou"" for example- it is hilarious to watch the characters be wacked by things because it\'s a result of a funny situation- no one is screaming and they sit with straight faces as they are hurt.  But the execution was not something repeated over and over and OVER.  Each situation was different.  They don\'t scream around naked making wierd noises and yelling about getting hurt; the people who made that know that that would be boring and what you would expect.  Yes-- Sora no Otoshimono wants you to laugh at how it looks instead of the story...  There was hardly any creativity involved, and a *perverted* 9-year-old could have made the ""funny"" parts in this anime.  When I don\'t find myself laughing for an entire episode of SNO, I can\'t argue with my instincts; it\'s just not that funny...I laugh pretty easily, so don\'t be pointing fingers.  The comedy gets 4/10 because, basically, it\'s not very original.As much as I would like to like this anime and give it an 8, 9, or 10 like other people have,  I\'m gonna have to say that it fell short on both comedy and plot.  The art and sound were the most enjoyable parts, but not as important, and the biggest disappointment were the characters.  Therefore, I will have to give this anime a 5/10.  But I\'m still open-minded enough to watch Season 2 (and 3?) because it would not be difficult to improve upon this anime.  Also, because I never drop and never plan to drop an anime.  I want to like it, but its potential was wasted.  Please respect my opinion, and I apologize if I have offended you.

Thank you for taking your time to read this, and I hope my review of the anime ""Sora no Otoshimono"" helped you! :)', 'If I could describe ""Sora no Otoshimono"" in a way that almost perfectly suits it I\'d say ""Sora no Otoshimono"" = Epic Trolling With a Story and Plot. And here\'s why I believe that:STORY: 8""Sora no Otoshimono"" doesn\'t focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how Ikaros became Tomoki\'s ""Pet Class Angeloid"". But it really doesn\'t need to as more than likely the sequels will explain that. In a Story perspective it mostly focuses on the daily events of Ikaros adapting to the human ways of life while attempting to understand her master and his perverted ways. As well as trying to understand...herself. The whole cast is constantly entangled with hysterical events such as flying panties that can achieve higher speeds than the famous SR-71 Black Bird (which leaves the pilot o_0 WTF?), exploring the new world that is the girls bathroom, a festival turned into a blood bath because of the attractive opportunity of 10,000,000 yen for shooting your neighbor, and understanding what it means to go on a date.ART: 10This was clearly for me one of the best hand drawn and partially CG\'d anime\'s I have ever seen. Sora no Otoshimono stands rightfully and proudly next to Steins;Gate and Nisemonogatari. Kudos to the staff for such wonderful, beautifully hand drawn characters.SOUND: 9The opening was actually worth my time to watch as well as the different endings each and every episode had. I mean who else would watch openings and endings other than for the music it has? And as much as I liked Tomoki\'s song of ""My Tingling Nipples"" I still feel the music was just a tad bit shy of perfection.CHARACTER: 8I feel that all of the main characters deserve their own criticism from me separately as they have earned it so here it is.Ikaros: Our somewhat emotionless heroine. It seems that the story leans more toward her than it does to Tomoki. As she attempts to understand what it means to be human and blend into society anonymously (tho fails epically). She unknowingly takes her master\'s and co\'s lessons that try to teach her to be more human like far too literally. Often concluding with humorous results. Such as lying. (The lying lesson was NOT given to her by her master and co but by a passerby) As this passerby tells what I presume to be his girlfriend ""lying is human"" Ikaros takes this to the extreme. Shockingly telling a chef his food looks like shit, while also declaring to a mother her baby is hideous. These are one of the many reasons why you might just fall in love with Ikaros.Nymph: She isn\'t completely introduced until episode 6. A bit of a delay to present the show\'s tsundere but better late than never. I personally enjoyed the introduction of Nymph. What would you think if you woke up in your household, went to your living room, only to find a complete stranger comfortably making themselves at home in your household? You\'d possibly freak the fuck out if you didn\'t have anyone else with you. But with Nymph having a connection with Ikaros it only made it more mysterious of why she\'d even be there. Her characteristics are also very familiar but not despised of. With the traits of a tsundere and attitude of a smart aleck, she also attempts to understand what it is to be human. She is shown often calling Tomoki and anyone else she sees as an idiot a ""bug"". But as the story progresses she opens herself like every other tsundere would. She reminded me of Haruna from Kore wa ""Zombie Desu ka?"". (well Iori Nomizu does voice both Nymph and Haruna lol) Nonetheless, she is a welcomed character to the series.Sohara Mitsuki: Sohara felt more like a side character than a real main character to me. After viewing the first episode and observing her characteristics, I quickly realized that I have found yet another typical childhood friend who fails to convey her feelings properly to the boy she loves. This is such an overused concept in anime that it has started to annoy me. Time and time again I frequently run into anime\'s that use this same concept. Whether it be ""Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity"" or ""Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi"". In the end the result is the same: Childhood friend either wins the heart of his/her love interest or doesn\'t. So what was enjoyable about Sohara now that you more or less understand what I am seeing? Nothing much sadly. The best way I can describe her is to say that she is a cup that is half empty. The description given about her reveals no spoilers and nothing new in the anime world. She typically karate chops Tomoki for not giving her the attention she utmost desires. Although he does deserve it with certain actions he takes, she shouldn\'t be frequently chopping him for every small perverted thing he does. He\'s a maturing man like he said and needs to tune his manliness. How could he help getting a hard on in the morning? Hasn\'t she ever heard of something called morning wood? I am fully aware that the developers put her in the story for a love triangle relationship and a comedic effect. But after a while I had grown more attached to Ikaros (and even Nymph) that I figured it probably would have been better to ax her and never introduce her to the story in the first place. It was funny the first few times she knocked Tomoki\'s lights out. But after a while of the same shit and repeat, it began to make me question if she was worth the time introducing and putting the effort to make her part of the show.Tomoki Sakurai: A troll genius. Possibly every wish he has I wish greater. Whether it\'d be the power to turn invisible to grope my girlfriends tits, or freeze time to run around streaking in public. It wouldn\'t matter as long as I have a beautiful Angeloid that obeys my every command and that accompanies me throughout my mischievous deeds. And that is precisely what this lucky little bastard has done and gone through. His motto (which is one that Me Gusta) is to live in peace and quite. But after running into and forever bonded to an Angeloid named Ikaros, that soon changes indefinitely. As he constantly throws himself into 100% lethal situations which he is only to be saved by his gorgeous Angeloid. Although ironically Ikaros is one of the major sources of chaos and disarray, he full knowing this continues to support and help her in her quest to be more human like. His characteristics are that of a perverse old man. His desire to sniff panties and wear them cannot be stopped. His raging hormones strongly portray what it means to be young, dumb, and full of cum. But despite all of this, he still has that soft spot for caring about what matters most. The well being of his friends and his Angeloid.Mikako Satsukitane: The sadistic bitch in the series. Reading the description about her practically notifies you of what is to come when she is brought into the story. While her presence seems that of a bystander she is involved partly in the story. She is seen mostly around Eishirou. Conversing her thoughts on his thoughts of the new world. She and him feel to me more like background characters that fill in the empty space of what could have been.  I do enjoy her haughty smile and deeply provoking comments, but this is one bitch you don\'t want to fuck with. During Ikaros\'s silver tongue moment, she specifically stated Mikako was ""nice"". Anyone with half a brain would instantly recognize what she meant by that.Eishirou Sugata: The man who dreams to find the new world. Going as far as to creating his own home-made glider only to make a few ""miscalculations"" and plummet from the skies above to meet the concrete floor. It seemed to me that he was completely obsessed with the idea of there being a new world above us. He portrays himself as a shady character with little to no background. He is the founder of the New Continent Discovery Club and is found in the beginning of each episode presenting to you his pretty assistant and a ""The More You Know"" like dialog. He continuously provides information that should not be know by regular human beings. And it seems he has experience with Angeloids. As he states to Ikaros ""Stop playing dumb, you couldn\'t possibly be a Pet Class Angeloid."", as well as having a high-tech computer that monitors Ikaros\'s state and condition.ENJOYMENT: 9A few times I almost fell off my chair laughing from its humor that it constantly loves to give to its viewers. It does have a lot of ecchi moments involved but I wasn\'t bothered by it at all. If anything I enjoyed it. I loved the story as well as the characters and the art was simply gorgeous. The sound was near perfection and the story set out for what it was going to do. And that is a humorous and enjoyable time.OVERALL: 9""Sora no Otoshimono"" is a Comedy, Ecchi, Sci-Fi, Shounen, Supernatural anime with some romance sprinkled on top for good measure of an amusing time. I most certainly enjoyed putting 312 minutes of my spare time into ""Sora no Otoshimono"". It may not be for everyone as this mainly aims for a comedic effect and an ecchi audience. But it also has some super cereal moments involved for you ManBearPigs. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an anime that aims to make your stomach hurt from laughter.

It was reccomended as the best comedy anime of the year, so I decided to check it out. The series is easily found online or on a DVD (they have it on eBay for those who don't live in Japan) and it is subtitled (not dubbed---an automatic check in my mind).Now this series is a comedy primarily, but it has some romantic/sci-fi elements. The plot centers mostly around getting a laugh, except for the last few episodes of the season. It certainly doesn't dissapoint.If you don't like perverted humor and prefer things...to be funny because of the language versus situational humor, this probably isn't for you. But those of us with dirty minds and the ability to laugh at an anime that can laugh at itself will enjoy it.Especially great are the sequences they play during the credits....always really funny and entertaining.Overall, not exactly the most original plot/characters but it is pretty funny and is good for what it is.Fair warning: the theme song is really, really catchy and there are a lot of boobs. to be funny because of the language versus situational humor, this probably isn't for you.

Sora no Otoshimono (or Heaven's Lost Property), is probably THE BEST example I've seen of an Ecchi comedy that manages to successfully transcend the realms of stupidity to produce an excellent anime with a memorable story and amazing characters. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.Oh yeah, you fell from the sky yesterday... right... - TomokiThis quote from the first episode, combined with Tomoki's reaction effectively sums up how over-the-top Sora no Otoshimono(SnO) gets and how mind-numbingly insane, the situations that are going to occur in Tomoki's life will be. Tomoki himself states that this story is the depiction...of the downfall of his peaceful and quiet life, into flying panties, well endowed angeloids and karate chops that defy every possible law of physics. It's exactly this stupidly over-the-top comedy combined with the excellent art direction and characters that make SnO such a great show to watch. It never takes itself too seriously or tries to present over complicated plot and character developments every five seconds, instead it relies on natural character development and maturity and certain key moments of plot development resulting in both a touching story and great Ecchi and comedy moments thus keeping the viewer entertained and hooked episode upon episode. The humour never gets stale, SnO keeps it interesting and mixes it up just enough so that you, the viewer continue to laugh episode after episode.The art of SnO is beautiful, instantly from the first episode you can see this show has great production values, the characters are well drawn and the environments are varied, and very well coloured. Being an Ecchi comedy the girls and their underwear are incredibly well drawn and the girls themselves designed and detailed to near perfection. The animation is also very fluid and dynamic, and feels very natural to they eye. Boobs bounce well, skirts fly and panties get flashed with graceful movement (is that even possible!??). The characters are often represented in Chibi form, which is very well done and fits in with the shows comedic nature, it continuously reminds the viewer not to take the show too seriously and adds to the overall humour. However where the art and animation really shines in this series is the characters facial expressions and emotions, Icarus one of the angeloids carries a sad, melancholic expression throughout the series, and to put it simply it looks amazing, the studio really succeeded in making believable emotions and this works great with the character development.The sound is another plus for this anime, the OP is a kind of catchy, melancholic song that really represents the series emotional and serious side, the ED or should I say EDs are where this show feels unique and interesting. Each episode has a unique ending that ties in with the events that took place during that episode, and are accompanied by an epilogue styled animation that shows the aftemath of what occured during that episode. The BGM is also good, it fits well with the comedy and really compliments the emotional scenes when they occur, theres also never a moment in this show where you hear a piece of BGM and feel its overused or too predictable.Now comes the part of this show that makes it shine compared to all the other Ecchi comedies out there, the characters and story. The characters of this show are the main reason why it's so enjoyable they all feel natural and are developed well giving viewers a reason to pay attention to them. Since the cast of recurring characters is small the producers manage to give each character ample enough time to become well developed. One of the characters that stood out for me has to be Sugata, described during the first episode as a highly intelligent, extremely creepy and perverted guy and also introducing each episode, he has the most interesting role in the series. He attempts to discover the so called 'New World' where the angeloids came from thus he continuously observes Icarus and Nymph. He is highly intelligent and perceptive thus picking up on things no one else in the series manages too, his comments and dialogue often give the viewer understanding and insight as well as questions about the angeloids and who they really are.The story is another plus point to this anime, it is very well executed and fits in with all the randomness and comedy of the show, in most episodes the story is just an undertone and is shows through the way the characters develop and interact with each other. However during the select key moments of the series when the story takes the driving seat, it executes well and piques the viewers interest making them ask questions and wonder what is going to happen next, it also manages to make very effective use of emotion making the viewer want to be involved in it all the much more. The seriousness picks up most at the end of the show and the viewer really feels and understands the angeliods, giving the story and excellent and dramatic ending.All in all SnO is a beautiful and well executed show that shows just how versatile the Ecchi comedy genre can be if done properly. of the downfall of his peaceful and quiet life, into flying panties, well endowed angeloids and karate chops that defy every possible law of physics.

I cried like I haven't cried in the last three years after that show. So emotional at the end, but very well worth it. The story was absolutely stellar, the best I've seen so far. The art is pretty good, the character development is brilliant, and it never failed to make me laugh, even in the most embarrassing moments. Just an all around great anime. If you are planning on watching it, watch the first two seasons, then read the manga til the end, then watch the movies that replace seasons 3 & 4. Otherwise, you miss a lot...of content.

As we all know the ecchi genre has a lot of fanservice and it can become the focus of some animes,but WOW I was blown away by Heaven\'s Lost Property. To start off we have the characters, The main character Tomoki is a huge pervert who just wants a quiet life. Ikaros the ""angeloid"" who struggles with being human was just adorable. Tsugata the ""genius"" of the cast who has a strange obsession with flying. Sohara tomoki\' childhood friend who constantly punishes him for his pervy ways. Finally Mikako a...sarcastic rich girl. The story focuses on the misadventures of the characters and later focuses on dealing with trying to make Ikaros human. This led to a lot of comedic situations, which were always something different. The only real recurring joke of the series was Sohara\'s deadly karate chop, and even then that was kept at a level where it was still funny when it came down to the scene. The music of this anime was extremely catchy, the opening theme especially. The animation was superb, it used a creative mix of bright and dark shades which complimented each other very well. The character designs were all very unique especially Ikaros in her original outfit. Lastly the voice acting in the English dub is outstanding(for the most part). All together Heaven\'s lost property is a very good example of the potential of the ecchi genre, if you like ecchi animes don\'t miss this anime, you\'ll regret it sarcastic rich girl.

Because of the interesting and serious storyline, I find myself really...disturbed.  I will explain.Characters: The characters are pretty...well...platonic.  While for the most part they don't change, it doesn't hinder the plot in any way.  However, only the main female who's arc is named after really only changes character-wise in the series.Story: While for the most part, this anime does have serious side to it, and has a very gripping overarching plot.  However, I forgot to mention the pure amount of fanservice there is.  Sora...no Otoshimono has to be one of the biggest fanservice animes out there, next to HOTD.  They devote entire episodes to fanservice, and can really turn a viewer away.Sound and art: The art is adequate and pleasing to the eye.  They especially put great detail on the wings in the series and make the characters more...well, angel-like.  There is also the comical chibi aspect which becomes very prominent in fanservice episodes, telling the viewer what to come.  (This is a warning if you plan to watch this.) For sound, the general sound in the anime itself isn't very note-worthy.  The opening however is very upbeat and can guarantee at least a little bit of finger tapping along with the beat.Personal enjoyment: While blocking out every single fanservice episode that existed in this anime. (I count at least half of it.) Sora no Otoshimono has a good plot in my opinion.  The mysteries, the questions.  It's all very intriguing and personally, I can't wait to watch more of this...probably while blocking out what horrible mental images I have been shown. no Otoshimono has to be one of the biggest fanservice animes out there, next to HOTD.  They devote entire episodes to fanservice, and can really turn a viewer away.Sound and art: The art is adequate and pleasing to the eye.  They especially put great detail on the wings in the series and make the characters more...well, angel-like.  There is also the comical chibi aspect which becomes very prominent in fanservice episodes, telling the viewer what to come.  (This is a warning if you plan to watch this.)

Rather, it actively squanders its potential by trying to be funny and perverted, which it's not very good at.I really wanted to love this show, okay? I really do love all the Angeloids, and the best moments are really great. It looks good for its time, and even has a separate ED for each episode, some of which are very memorable. Most importantly, the overarching story is quite good.But man, I really don't like some of the things it does. Chibi abuse is when a show draws characters in a...small and simple style more often than it doesn't, and Heaven's Lost Property is highly guilty of it, specifically with Tomoki. Rather than cutting corners, it feels like more of a way to separate the comedy/ecchi scenes from the more serious ones, but he's chibi like 80% of the time, often when everyone else isn't. This brings us to my second complaint: Tomoki fucking sucks. I've rarely had a big problem with a lecherous MC, but when it gets taken to far it gets really fucking old really quickly, and Heaven's Lost Property does this shit nonstop. The weird thing, it's rarely directed at the girls in his harem, but rather at just about every other girl at his school. And this schtick is accompanied by other girls, in particular Sohara, laying on Tom and Jerry-style abuse. Third complaint: Sohara is too mean to Tomoki. In episode 3, Sohara indirectly blows up Tomoki's house, and if not for the cartoon physics, Tomoki himself would be dead. Does she apologize? Hell, she doesn't even let him stay in her house next door! So they all have to go to Mikako's, where he again almost dies, but ends up getting his house rebuilt by them. Anyway, Sohara basically murders Tomoki several times over the course of the series, and he takes obscene amount of abuse from everyone else as well, that really doesn't sit right with me. Especially since Sohara is confirmed to ENJOY Tomoki's behavior, and fantasize about it often. Not to mention, this show is considered an ecchi, but it's almost not hot at all. I would've preferred they just cut the peeping and groping altogether and let the Angeloids' outfits speak for themselves.These three complaints serve to undermine almost everything that makes Heaven's Lost Property good. The story about Angeloids coming from on high and learning what love means to them while fighting against their homeworld is interesting, fun, and otherwise well-executed. They could've cut at least some of the fluff to characterize the Angeloids (or even other characters) better, but I think the serious scenes are mostly good as-is. The main exception is the finale movie, which awkwardly cuts off the manga and kind of just leaves you confused and sad.Overall, Heaven's Lost Property is good. I think its highs make it still worth watching, and admittedly some of the fluff was pretty fun. Saori Hayami, who voices Ikaros, has the voice of an angel, and she gets many chances to sing some really good songs. Pretty much all the girls were super loveable in their own ways, (even the non-Angeloids, though I probably disliked them more than I liked them) with best girl Kazane (save for Tomoko) not appearing until the first movie. I will probably go on to remember it as something I'm torn on, but ultimately glad I watched. small and simple style more often than it doesn't, and Heaven's Lost Property is highly guilty of it, specifically with Tomoki.

Not just that, every single episodes tells and comes with different style which is unique in my opinion. Sometimes it sad, sometimes is relaxing, funny and fun to watch....Furthermore, the story strongly implement the value of friendship, love and caring among the main characters.Every different characters comes with different personality and weird behavior/hobbies and I found that this makes sora no otoshimono is fun to watch.The music was amazing and fits into every scenes from serious, funny, sad and relaxing tones.Overall this is a must watch, it just more than comedy harem anime.:)P/S: Sorry for my english.

Of it\'s genre, it stands out from the crowd in that the jokes are actually funny and the ecchi isn\'t over the top, yet it still falls prey to flat characters and a storyline which lacks a bit.Ecchi is like the topping on a hot dog, it\'s not the main attraction but it certainly adds flavor. While some series sacrifice all else for ecchi, Sora no Otoshimono moderates itself (just a little bit). It\'s not a (huge) distraction, which is good.The characters are pretty flat. The...character that develops the most is Icarus (Ikaros), who struggles with trying to become more human like for her master. That doesn\'t get very far, nor does it really seem to be a driving point in the story.The story, it actually includes drama. There were a few parts where I knew what was going to happen solely because I read the manga, yet I still was shocked to see it happen. It kicks it from comedy to drama in a few seconds, but unfortunately only when it comes to one character. Still, plenty of ""oh snap!"" moments.Each episode has it\'s own ending theme, and episode eleven has a different main vocalist for the opening. The end themes are sometimes parodies of other end themes, but not always. The twelfth and thirteenth endings are actually quite beautifully done in my opinion.However there\'s a spot in which Icarus sings. I was looking forward to hearing it after reading the manga, but the actual song is disappointing.The art of this series is based off of the art of the manga, and while they did some parts worse than the manga overall I\'d actually say that they illustrated the characters better, Icarus especially. I didn\'t really notice how well designed she was until I watched the anime. On the other hand, three unnamed characters seemed a bit underwhelming.I enjoyed the series myself, but it is quite episodic. You could cut out a lot of episodes, but then again you could also take the pictures out of a children\'s storybook.This series is not meant for heavy storyline fans. character that develops the most is Icarus (Ikaros), who struggles with trying to become more human like for her master.

I was wrong.After I finished the show, the first season rather, I was overall very happy with the show and i'm excited to watch the next season. Like I said the show really surprised me, it had a good story that didn't feel rushed or slow so I was always entertained. There was a good amount of action to mix in with the character drama and general story. It was very lighthearted and comical...with serious and emotional moments sprinkled in here and there. Basically it was very entertaining, I honestly never found myself bored with the show at all. However if echi is something that bothers you, this show isn't for you because there is quite alot of it. Personally though it didn't bother me the slightest...I found it funny how they used the echi for the most part in a comidic way. If you like echi this is the perfect show for you. Heaven's lost Property didn't leave me on a high note or anything but I really enjoyed it nonetheless.Story(8) The story in the show was executed very well. Like I said the show never had pacing issues so it never really felt rushed or went by slow. Most of the story is centered around Tomoki's (the main character) antics and what he does with his group of friends. Tomoki stumbles upon Icarus, an angeloid who acts as his servent. This is what makes the story interesting because she can practically grant his every wish and she lives to serve him. Tomoki however is a high school pervert who does anything he can to peep a girl nude even his friends, this is what makes the story interesting and very funny as well. The relationships between the characters work very well with the story and they act as one of the things that make the story really good. The story isn't anything incredible but it is very unique and entertaining all the same. While all the lighthearted activities are going on there is an over shadowing dark side to the story which helps keep the plot fresh. The last episode in particular really picked up in the action aspect and it was was very satisfying. As i said before the show is a comedy so there's alot of funny moments that will keep you enetertained all the way through.Animation(9) I'm watching this in 2014 now, for something back in 2009 the animation is very impressive. All the colors are bright and vibrant but not overdone. The character designs are unique but not out of place at the same time. The two angeloid characters had very unique armor designes and they had a cool backstory to them. The action scenes rare as they come were animated perfectly. They were nice to look at and not over exaggerated. All the characters moved very fluently and smoothly so generally it just looked good. The show turns the characters into chibi's very often as well to overexaggerate comedy moments and just add a light hearted funny tone to the story. I do feel they overused the chibi thing a bit but nevertheless it kept the show unique and it worked good for the whole feel of the story. The wide eyed designs of the characters looked nice and the CGI effects looked good as well amd weren't out of place.Sound(7) This goes without saying, the noises were crisp and clean and sounded good. Funimation outdid itself with the voice casting once again. I thought all the voices were cast perfectly and none came off as annoying to me. The opening track was very very good as well, it fit the show's light hearted tone perfectly and it was a beautiful song. The ending was very good as well and during the endings the show would play a music video type of thing to keep it different. The music didn't amaze me though, The music kind of faded in the background to me and i found myself paying attention to the characters and what they were doing. The music wasn't bad or out of place it's just not very memorable. However this is a small complaint at the end of the day it's not a big deal.Characters (8) At first the characters didn't seem like much to me, they did grow on me alot though. Tomoki binds the story together with his perverted actions and brought alot of comedy. I could relate to him a bit too because I myself am a highschool student who likes peace and quiet. Icarus is very robotic so part of the story deals with her trying to be more human. This also comes off as a very funny element in the story and she can also be badass at times too. The other side characters work very well too. The show keeps its circle small and aside from Tomoki and Icarus there are 4 other characters. The show focus's the most on Tomoki, yes, but the side characters all get alot of screentime and are developed very well. One of the shows best qualities is the relationships between all the characters. Like any other show the characters have drama and of course this is very interesting without feeling clichè. As I said the supporting cast were all interesting unique characters with good funny personalities. They themselves are not incredibly compelling, but they are developed well and have good chemistry.Overall I enjoyed the show alot. It didn't leave me on a high note and wasn't amazing but I was satisfied completely. The story was executed smoothly and had a good mix of drama romance and action. The show was very funny and lighthearted while having a unique feel to it. The characters had really good chemistry and I liked all of them. The animation was spot on and the voice acting was very well done as well. The echi didn't bother me and i found it to be funny most of the time, so if you're on the ropes about weather or not its gonna bother you it probably wont. It's not overdone to the point where the story loses quality it basically fits in perfectally. If echi is not your thing at all then I don't know what to say, it's all preference. Fans of comedy and drama will like this as well.I apologize for the long review :p but please give this a thumbs up if you agreed! (: with serious and emotional moments sprinkled in here and there.

(:"", 'I continue to violently hate the ecchi genre, yet violently love it at the same time. And it’s in no way because it’s always going to give you something new and exciting to watch. The ecchi harem genre especially, for me at least, is always the kind of place I go when I have no idea what to watch next and want something semi-decent that I know I’ll like in some regard. The anime in this genre are so dependably generic and so…well, they’re just always the same. And while the degree of comedy changes from one anime to the next, the plot devices, the...characters, the settings; they all seem to be the exact same thing every time. Of course, this is a problem that I point out consistently when reviewing anime of this genre, but at the same time there is something good about it. I guess ecchi harem comedies are good to fall back on when you want something dependable to watch.I mean, read the following plot synopsis, switch out some attributes of the characters, and you have just about every anime of this genre.Heaven’s Lost Property (or Sora no Otoshimono, though Heaven’s Lost Property is easier to remember) is the story of Tomoki, an average pervert who lives alone because his parents are out on vacation or some such bullshit, and dreams of angels for some reason. When sitting under the stars the sky starts to fall and he winds up saving this scantily clad “angeloid” named Ikaros. She winds up becoming subservient to him and follows him around, helping him achieve his perverted means. So, with his new found angel to provide him with the means, Tomoki ends up doing all kind of terrible things to his childhood friend, and the girl who loves him, Sohara. But the girl continues to love him for whatever reason. There’s the implication of a love triangle, though there is absolutely nothing romantic between any of the characters.Tomoki goes to high school where he is friends with a weird guy named Eishiro who is attempting to find the New World, and he’s also friends with the class president, daughter of a Yakuza boss. Of course, hilarity ensues. As the story progresses, we meet another angeloid named Nymph who has come to take back Ikaros, who is apparently a terrible weapon. Nymph slowly grows to like Ikaros and Tomoki, though, and from there, I’ll leave the rest of the plot up to you to discover.Sounds pretty typical, right? Normal guy (this time a perv rather than a tsundere) meets a strange, otherworldly girl with a checkered past. Winds up in a love triangle with weird girl and childhood friend. Yes, we’ve seen it before.And it doesn’t stop at the plot. Heaven’s Lost Property resorts to the familiar settings we’ve seen in a hundred other romcom’s/ecchi’s/harem’s. The beach, the pool, the hot spring, the school festival, the regular festival. But unlike many shows like Heaven’s Lost Property, these episodes are typically…funny. Surprisingly, the very, very perverted main character is hilarious. Usually I can do without jokes that depend on panties and boobs for a cheap laugh but the migrating panties was so ridiculous, it was hilarious. Tomoki is always getting into idiotic situations that never fail to illicit a laugh from me. Heaven’s Lost Property is unashamedly dirty, constantly depicting Tomoki naked, face planting in girls crotches, and balancing things on his dick.  In any other anime, these things would be unfunny, but Heaven’s Lost Property manages to make it hilarious and entertaining.That’s not to say that the show is without its faults. I cannot commend it for following genre conventions, nor can I really commend its attempt to focus on a lackluster serious plot. As with most anime of this type, HLP has a serious plot that runs through the entire series but is only severely focused on at the end. This serious plot is mildly interesting, though nothing is explained to a point where you would care about it beside, perhaps, for one character.That character is Nymph. And while I won’t say she’s a fantastic character, she was pretty damn likeable. She has been abused by her master in heaven and is, well, lost. She can’t enjoy anything because of how horrible her master is to her, but finds some comfort and love in Tomoki’s household. She is at first after Ikaros, but the two quickly grow a sisterly bond and any want of being with her current master is dashed. Out of all of the characters, she was my favorite by far. She had much more to her emotions and she was all around a good character.Meanwhile Ikaros is just…there. She’s nothing special and as she grows and develops she only grows to mention things we can see coming from a mile away. She wants to hold Tomoki’s hand. She’s scared of admitting that she’s a weapon. It’s all very predictable.Tomoki, our star, is, as stated, brutally hilarious at times. His attempts at seeing panties and getting close to girl’s crotches are constantly funny. A good character? Not so much. But a funny one.And then there is Sohara and the others, but you’ve met them before in countless anime. So I won’t worry about going into any detail. Suffice it to say, they play their roles but are uninteresting otherwise.Quite simply, HLP is one of the better harem/ecchi/comedy series I have seen. It’s surprisingly funny, entertaining, and a teeny bit sad at points.Is it worth your time? Maybe. If you enjoy this genre, then this is one of the best I’ve seen. If not, then I can’t see why you would even consider it.With great comedy, a new ED every episode, and Nymph, HLP stands out as one of the best, if not the best, ecchi/harem/romcom I’ve ever seen. It’s up there with Baka and Test at least. characters, the settings; they all seem to be the exact same thing every time.

If not, then I can’t see why you would even consider it.With great comedy, a new ED every episode, and Nymph, HLP stands out as one of the best, if not the best, ecchi/harem/romcom I’ve ever seen. It’s up there with Baka and Test at least.', ""My reviews are not super long, if you don't like the review please move on.Sora no Otoshimono is a super ecchi that also happen to be a comedy. The plot is just mindbogglingly amazing, the characters are insanely funny, the artwork is superb, and the soundtracks are well chosen. Yes, Sora no Ototshimono is an ecchi which some viewers find despicable, but something about this anime, It just brings something to the table that other ecchi animes don't deliver.If you got some spare time, go watch this anime. It made me laugh really hard and it will probably make you laugh as well (But...make sure you have a lot of time because this anime is 3 seasons long.) make sure you have a lot of time because this anime is 3 seasons long.)"", 'Please note: This review is for the FIRST SEASON of Heaven\'s Lost Property (Sora no Otoshimono) only. Season two and the two movies are not taken into account during this review.Story: 5/10 - This is one of those anime where the boobs are bigger than the plot. The story to season one is simple: A robotic angel (Angeloid) who has the power to grant any wish named Icarus falls out of dark flying vortex that has been orbiting Earth for 13 months, and her only desire is to serve an oridinary perverted teenage boy who witnessed the crash. The boy (Tomoki), has been having strange...vivid dreams throughout his life where he sees a beautiful angel reach out for him before flying away, and he is dead set on determining why he is having these strange dreams. Also, another Angeloid named Nymph randomly appears shortly after. So with the powers of two Angeloids, Tomoki, his short-tempered friend (Sohara), the sociopath student president Mikako, and the knowledgeable nerd with the passion of flying (Eishirou), face the most harshest of challenges (like why Sohara\'s panties keep magically flying into space).Art: 8/10 - This was my most painful score to give during this review. Why? Because the animation can be fucking mindblowing... when it wants to be. However, a lot of times the series spends time ""beating a dead horse"" with old chibi jokes. I personally find this really disappointing since the animation can easily top 98% of any other Shounen out there... but it chooses not to.Sound: 8/10 - My biggest irritation with the sound category was the fact that Funimation decided to give Greg Aryes the role as the main role in the dub. I honestly have nothing against Greg Aryes, but when he is put into a main role, it leaves the viewers pulling their hair out listening to that typical voice. He makes a great ""comic relief sidekick"" voice, but nothing else.  Besides that, the background music is pretty good and the intro is kick-ass to say the least.Character: 6/10 - With the exception of Nymph, all the other characters feel so two dimensional in this anime. Icarus literally has the emotions of a robot, Tomoki is you\'re typical pervert that you see in every Ecchi anime, Sohara is also a fairly 2-D character with not much going for her, as she continues to stay in an abusive friendship with Tomoki (despite the hilarity that comes from the friendship).Enjoyment: 10/10 - This is by far, the shows strongest point. The storyline and characters may leave a lot to be desired, but it sure as hell interesting to watch. This anime was so funny that it had me on the floor as my lungs forcibly ejected any oxygen from my body. The shear enjoyment of watching Tomoki\'s perversion backfire is always a marvel to behold, and when that\'s not happening, the show usually entertains with an awesome Angeloid on Angeloid battle scene.Honestly, there is one reason why I\'d suggest Heaven\'s Lost Property to anyone, and that\'s the shear entertainment value that\'s radiating from the show. If you are not a fan of cheesy-plot ecchi, however, this may not be the anime for you. Overall: 7/10 vivid dreams throughout his life where he sees a beautiful angel reach out for him before flying away, and he is dead set on determining why he is having these strange dreams.

This series has good battle scenes, ton of parodies and some best though out joke about ecchi in general, good music, great character that have many level to them (why this series has some of my most favorite character in all anime), and a story, where creator will tease you with plot point and only give out so much information. In other worlds top notch story writing. That will make want more. Why there been two season and one movie only tiny bit over all story has been...revealed. It's only fault lie in either people will find it can be too much or for me, it was that story has good pace but it little a bit of mess.To say their one story to Sora no Otoshimono is lie. First all this is big mac combo. You have the normal ecchi comedy over done school boy pervert story with point fan serves episode. It is also comedy that parody ecchi humor. Instead this being ecchi comedy. Then we have the hidden social commendatory of slavery, weapon mass destruction, and dystopia. Then god/angel theme with a world bender to fantasy adventure plot line. Which is most of keep in the dark.The character development is not really there for some cast but for those don't develop their persona are pretty well made and set in their role. But for main angel cast it's there. Over all character are well design. The main character is pretty manic, complex, and is a mess. You know what I mean once you get know him. He kind reflect story itself and how messy it is.The music is real good and this where you will see main parody part of series. Almost every episode come with it own ending and that ending will reflect plot for that episode. The ending visual and song will be parody of what episode plot was parodying. There is range but most of parody are of anime, so you may not need know much about japan. (oh note: I review from sub point of view, I don't like dubs.)Art and animation is good. This series actual has over all potent joke for ecchi. The creator those not hold back nor hold your hand. Comedy and ecchi are reflection of each other in this series. I think creator trying make point with these to element about ecchi genera. I could be wrong this is pure conjecture on my part but that going on what I watched.I highly recommend this series. If see you my list, you know I watch a lot over years. I feel like i got enough under my belt to know what good. You at least try the 1st season. Warning as I said before, when it come to ecchi part, the creator here does not holding back. If you can't handle ecchi, then don't watch this series. But it's not only fan serves. It's has real fun fantasy adventure plot under it.

The absurd humor and the way the series mocks itself in a way just make it awesome.Also, this is probably the only series I know of where I was excited to see the end credits. Not because the episodes are boring or just awful to look at, the sole reason for this is that each episode has its unique credits of which most are utterly hilarious with or without context (flying pantsu)If you like slapstick, pantsu, perverted teenagers, boobs or just plain old WTF moments.

I taught the ecchi was a bit too focussed on male desires. And the romance was weird since its an on and off relationship, prerry much at one moment they like each other then they hate each other after a minute again etc. And there was a lack of the sci-fi promised genre, it's...basicly in 2/3 episodes which i think is quite stupid but they did well on making the sci-fi the base and start working towards the romance/comedy parts. I would say this isn't bad but not really that cool i guess.Art and Sound are Short. why? because you should check out atleast a bit to understand and it's diffucult to explain.Story:The story isn't unique at all and i have seen the same basic story over and over again but this one is the best of all those i ve seen. Because this accualy has a story and more parts of the story will come later on in the anime. Also small things like history of the exploring age will be taught to you. And the best thing of all. This anime isn't focussed on echhi but humor. which is most of the times not the case. There is use of fanservise but not as much as other ecchi anime's.Art:Nothing to complain simple style good enough great character arts but less work on the detailled work.Sound:hears fine nothing special good enough and pretty much nothing to say about it.Charaters:Great work Close to it's perfection. Good feelings expression and great work on the things the character likes. for example a girl likes bird. when she sees any bird she accauly reacts to it. and doesn't only interfere in a single episode but in the whole anime. Characters keep their habbits and reactions and have their personal feelings on the actions. Pretty good i would say.Enjoyment:This is the anime that has given me the most fun ever. Why? because this anime is random. Really random. From a festival to a gunfight. it's these random things that make me laugh and keep smiling. With fun jokes. and some extra romance. they did excelent. on the enjoyment.Overall:A fun not to serious and random anime with good story and character design basic art & sounds.

Sora no Otoshimono is one of the funniest series that I have  ever seen. This series is funny, can get serious at moments, has a terrific cast of characters.Story: I'll say this, Sora's ANIME has no real plot. Aside from the season finales and a few things that go on in between, there is no real story line. When I watched Sora I accidentally watched it's second season first having no prior knowledge of the first. I wasn't too lost and all the really important things that I needed to know...were in flashbacks. If you really want plot you should read the manga. It's like the anime but with a bit more things to the plot. (Also the ending of Forte doesn't exactly go with the manga, everything else does as far as I can remember.)Character: I loved loved loved the characters in Sora. The Main Character is a pervert who really makes no attempt to hide it, but also has a heart of gold. The Angeloids are a very fun bunch. All of them are funny in their own way and have 1 thing in common, they're clueless.In fact all the girls in the Sora series was very well done, all of them were funny and enjoyable, from the cunning School President, to the Clueless Angeloid, to the Childhood Friend who keeps him in line, they always keep me laughing.Overall: Overall the Sora no Otoshimono series was very good and one of my favorite animes. This anime was funny and well done, it has it's dark moments but always keeps you laughing and the lovable characters are just a joy. If you're looking for an anime series that will keep you laughing and you don't mind a little ecchi, or an anime that is just a good ecchi, or just a good ecchi anime in general, watch Sora no Otoshimono.

I mean I\'ve seen those animes where someone falls from the sky and serves the person she loves, I\'m referring to Ah! My Goddess, but this is by far one of my favorite shows in the history of anime. From the very beginning of the show, I was all like, oh, Tomoki is just an average teenager who likes peace and quiet. Completely normal. NOPE. Couldn\'t be more wrong. He\'s the biggest pervert I\'ve ever seen, and it shows throughout the season. So I\'m wondering just how the heck a guy like him could befriend...and bewitch an Angel like Ikaros to serve and love him. All I\'m thinking is that he\'s one of the luckiest guys in the history of situations like these.Story wise, it\'s really good. It has one giant plot in the show, a good one at that, and a bunch of mini-stories in every episode, like in one of the episodes, Tomoki has to escape his house completely covered in panties. Funny, but the reason he has to escape is because they have a spell on them that causes them to literally explode if he so much as looks at them. So there are stories like that, and the final few episodes kind of revolves around the main plot.Artwork was awesome. The setting that the characters live in was really beautiful, small town with a giant cherry tree sitting in a giant field surrounded by forests and mountains, a perfect place to go and relax. Tomoki\'s character art kind of took me off guard because for at least half of the show, he\'s in a chibified state, mostly when those awkward moments in echii\'s come around, or when he\'s acting like a pervert. Girls on the other hand, all of them were drop dead gorgeous. Ikaros is my personal favorite. She\'s beautiful.I liked the sound effects in the show whenever there were action scenes, and the bouncing sounds whenever those ""That\'s what makes this an echii"" scenes come around. I liked all of the voice actors, there wasn\'t one character that I hated. Greg Ayres was perfect for his role as Tomoki, Brittney Karbowski (A personal favorite voice actress) had Ikaros\' personality down to an art, all of the actors and actresses fit their characters perfectly.Characters, as I may have described a few to you before, are all funny as heck. Tomoki\'s perverted personality is what got me laughing over 3/4ths of the time alone, Ikaros had that lovable and sweet vibe coming from her the entire time, Nymph was a brat at first and I found her annoying, but as she kind of came into the show more and more I learned to love her, and Sohara and her Karate Chops have a place in my heart forever.I enjoyed this show entirely. It was probably the funniest thing I\'ve seen since I watched Chobits. TV-MA might be over exaggerating a little bit, maybe a high TV-14 at maximum, but this was completely fine to watch, even with my 9th grade friend. That\'s just a little heads up for those who are looking and debating whether they should watch it or not due to the rating. This anime is completely awesome to watch, and those who wont watch it will most likely regret it if they don\'t give it a chance. It\'s probably the best thing I\'ve watched this year next to Clannad and A Bridge to the Starry Skies.I hope this review helped. and bewitch an Angel like Ikaros to serve and love him.

What do flying underpants, a wish granting angel android, and a perverted boy have in common? This stupid show. It just feels like a pervert’s joyride. An angel named Ikaros comes down from heaven and ends up with a perverted little boy named Tomoki. I believe he got this bad because of his grandfather. His grandfather would tell him a lot of perverted words of wisdom.There are so many times this show goes overboard just for the fact that of fun. For example, panties...flying into window ends up with him making whole garlands of panties, goes to a robot that was made out of panties…… can you see where this goes? It just escalates from there. There is so much Ecchi in this show that you feel like drowning in it. A school life with a lot more ecchi then I would of liked in a show. And this is why I had dropped this show before.Sure in each episode, Eishoro ends up talking about something historic or scientific that is supposed to pertain to the show but it doesn’t. It feels like they are just trying to push more meaning into the story that doesn’t have one. This has Magical Girlfriend written all over it. Even the name of Ikaros’ program is a ‘Pet class’ and wears a chain and collar. Think of her as an Android and then think of Chobits… it’s pretty much the same with characters popping up all over. Chi and Ikaros have very much the same sort of problems though if I explained it; it would be a spoiler for the most part.The show would probably be very good if there wasn’t all the ecchi stuff. It has a deep meaning behind it and I guess that might be the part of the show I missed in my first watch because it only really shows its true face in episode 7. Much like Elfen Lied, we have a darker side of the anime two. So I guess it’s a mixture of Chobits and Elfen Lied with perverted wish granting powers. The bad thing about this is that it comes up so late in the show that it not only is it a big spoiler, it also ends up making the show look like a school life Ecchi up till then. Even after, it still looks like a school life Ecchi but at least it has more deep emotional reasoning behind me watching the rest of it.The animation is rather nice, actually rather beautiful. It is very clean and crisp, too bad it’s also very ecchi (Sorry all those wanting to see the whole thing, nothing really naked though). The characters are… colorful at least. I see it like a perverted version of Comic Party in look and feel.  Instead of Comics, the Tomoki is crazy about panties and breasts.Having said this, there are some good points. The characters actually seem a little human when they show the romantic parts and when the characters are not being fully perverted. The voices are pretty good and each one really fits the characters no matter what crazy emotion they do. The music is beautiful and without all the perverted things though the beginning song does get old when marathoning it.In the end, I did end up cutting the show short when I first dropped it. Would I ever watch it again? The answer to that is that I would probably have to hate myself to sit threw the torture that is the first few episodes to get to the good stuff but I might… ug…. Now there is the OVA and Forte that I might have to do… flying into window ends up with him making whole garlands of panties, goes to a robot that was made out of panties…… can you see where this goes?

Ep 2's ending song video is worthy of a classic.But after a while, the episodes stopped being anywhere near as imaginative. It was still decent ecchi entertainment, but just nowhere near as inspired.Definitely watch this if you're an ecchi fan, and plow right into the OVA and season 2. I didn't bother with the movie, though. Heard some bad things about it. "", 'Sora no Otoshimono is the usual ecchi anime. Good looking girls, A guy whos parents are never there, and for some reason he is living with all these girls usually arent 3-5 by the end of the series. The story though takes a different approach then usual by making the guy of the show a really huge perv. Usually the guy is all shy and feels weird when girls make sexual advances on them, but this guy iis obessed with girls boobs and porno magazines even having an episode in the second season where one of the characters burn his porno magazines and he cried...his eyes out.Story 7:This show has the usual supernatural story that leads girls to end up living in his house because they can not go back to where they came from. I was never really shocked from the twists they where pretty much predictable. It is possible though too get into this story a bit because of the fact that these girls are cybernetic angels kinda an interesting topic.Art 9:The art in this show was defiently very ecchi, yet it was drawn out very good alot of the time i was draw to this show because of how they designed the characters it might seem shallow but at times the story can be great, but if the design in the show is not great I usually do not feel like watching it.Sound 9:The soundtracks where actually pretty interesting in this show like the opening song, and the song that ikaros one of the angels sung ""falling down"" was also a favorite of mineCharacter 8:Characters in this show where the usual guy who cant get any, tsundere, apathetic girl, bubbly chick, and the evil girl who looks nice on the outside. Some of the characters peaked my interest though cause the tsundere girl would often break character being a sweet girl, while the apathetic girl would finally start showing emotion after a long time, so on.My enjoyment was an 8 because yes there was generic topics in this show, but hey watching boobies bouncing around which guy would not enjoy that  with a decent backstory of course :) his eyes out.Story 7:This show has the usual supernatural story that leads girls to end up living in his house because they can not go back to where they came from.

This is mindless fanservice at its utmost finest. The jokes never get old, its just too damn funny.I mean, go try to find another anime where panties fly like birds...that\'s really original lol.As in most ecchi animes, the story isn\'t really the strongest point, but it doesn\'t really need to be. The narrative successfully links the events together while also leading the viewer towards more hilarious fanservice! I suppose many of the episodes are filler-like, but towards the end the show takes a more serious and dramatic turn.The art is wonderful, really. I guess that\'s to be expected of modern anime...though, considering all the computer technology nowadays. Still, the colors are very crisp and clear and much attention to detail is paid. Of course, plenty of attention is paid on sex appeal, breasts, buts, etc. Is that bad? Hell no! Also, Tomoki is often drawn in a chibi version when he shows his perverted side. This adds to the comedy aspect by showing how lowly he\'s become, especially when he\'s being scolded. =DOn to the sound. Usually, i never listen to OPs and EDs, especially EDs. I just dont have the time for that. However, i did listen to the OP once and i think it fits the show pretty well. I don\'t usually notice a good BGM, just because they\'re so well integrated into the scene. Same goes for this anime. Voice acting is also very good. Emotions of the characters are expressed very well.The characters in Sora no Otoshimono are both unique and stereotypical. Let\'s start with Tomoki, our protagonist. This guy is nothing like I\'ve ever seen in anime, ever. He\'s a no holds barred, all-out, crazy, horny, pervert. And he\'s perfectly fine with everyone knowing that. Very very refreshing to see such a unique and fun fun protagonist. Of course, there\'s also the sterotypical huge-breasted best friend who always beats up Tomoki for his perversion. And guess what? She just happens to be in love with him. Kind of a generic character, but hey, she serves a much more important purpose, being the victim of many perverted acts. The angelroids are interesting int heir own way too, but getting into detail would involve spoilers. There\'s also Eitarou, a guy obsessed with finding the ""new world"", and there\'s Mikako, a sadistic, coniving, student council president.In short, this is a VERY VERY fun show to watch. The fanservice is executed with so much skill and precision, that it\'s simply breathtaking.The comedy always seems to find the perfect moment to get the most out of the viewer\'s reaction.

Most have been enjoyable, some have even been pretty memorable. While I can\'t say I enjoyed Sora no Otoshimono (Heaven\'s Lost Property, or HLP as I\'ll be referring to it from here on out) as much as CLAMPs take on sci-fi romantic comedy, it is certainly one of, if not the most memorable I\'ve seen since.The story seems generic enough, and for what it\'s worth, it really is. An overly horny high school guy happens across a...beautiful but strange non-human female who devotes her entire existence to him from that point forward. And after seeing Ikaros, our resident strange non-human, my fears weren\'t exactly eased. A slave creature called an ""Angeloid"", she looks like a blend of Chobits Chii and DearS Ren.But the show had one thing going for it right off the bat. The art is shockingly well done. I\'ll admit that I\'m brand new to watching anime, Chobits was indeed the show that finally got me hooked, but in this short time I\'ve noticed that these ecchi-centric series tend to have rather generic artwork. Not the case in HLP. Honestly, I\'d say it\'s extremely close to the quality you\'re looking at in Clannad, which to date, has the best art in any romance anime I\'ve seen thus far.And then came the humor. Once again, the ecchi genre tends to get a bad rap; I can understand that for the most part. There\'s a very difficult balancing act shows of the genre need to pull off. They need to have just the right amount of ecchi,  humor, and romance, and so far the only one that I\'ve seen that pulled that off flawlessly is Chobits. And then there\'s HLP.HLP basically looked at that and said ""forget that crap"". And somehow, it worked out brilliantly. There are panty flashes, porn mags, and boob gropes all over the place, but it\'s the shows acknowledgement of this that makes it work. Almost every ecchi show I\'ve seen has a panty buying episode. HLP? HLP has a flying panty episode. Yes. Flying panties, as in they literally jettison off of girls bodies, and flap away like birds (the scene that plays during the credits of that episode is officially the funniest thing I\'ve ever seen). The ""male dresses up as a female"" episode? HLP steps it up by actually turning Tomoki into a girl.But humor is only one part of show, and fortunately it has (once again) surprisingly well done character development, and most of it comes from Ikaros and a second Angeloid, Nymph. Really, you start to learn...well..everything about Ikaros once Nymph enters the picture. Til then the show introduces you to the generally generic human supporting characters. But with Nymph comes some of the most emotional scenes in the series, including one that is truly gut wrenchingly sad.As far as the action scenes go, they\'re also pretty well done. It\'s here that Ikaros\' very mechanical voice and nature shine. One of my main issues with her as a main character is that she never really evolves beyond her ""AI"" stage, even after the blocks that were supposedly keeping her that way are removed from her. But once those epic battles start, she starts to look and sound really cool. The best comparison I can make is KOS MOS from the Xenosaga game series, who I honestly feel was an inspiration for the angeloids in general.Where the show does lack in is romance. It\'s here, and Ikaros does start to realize feelings for Tomoki, but unfortunately he never really reciprocates them. As usual, a couple of the other supporting girls in the show start to get feelings for him too, but they\'re met with the same neutrality. That said, the HLP movie actually shows us that Tomoki has the capacity and desire to actually fall in love, so hopefully we\'ll get a bit more of a romance in the upcoming third season.In the end, I couldn\'t stop watching this show. Almost every episode it did something that surprised me, be that a flock of majestic flying panties, a particularly intense battle scene, or one of the emotional Nymph scenes. That, complimented with excellent art and a top-notch english dub easily put HLP into my top 10 of the genre. And if you\'re looking for a more light hearted, comedy focused romance, this\'ll likely turn into one of your favorites. beautiful but strange non-human female who devotes her entire existence to him from that point forward.

And anyone who is looking for some epic characters that will leave you wanting more needs to watch this anime."", 'A few days ago I finished Sora No Otoshimono (Heavens lost property)Genre: Ecchi, Action, Romance, ComedyIt was downright stupid, it has 2 seasons and 2 movies, the second movie has aired in Cinema\'s in Japan and is yet to be streamed and put on DVD/BluRaySTORY: 7Sora No Otoshimono is a story about a boy named Sakurai Tomoki who is living a norma, peaceful life when all that changes one night due to a girl falling from the sky and proclaiming him as her \'Master\', this girl is known as an \'Angeloid\'.The story is rather average for an Ecchi, nothing special, it has no real \'over-arching...story\' and just follows many smaller arcs relating to each \'Angeloid\' and how they come to meet and form their relationships with Tomoki, It is also a very emphasized harem.ART: 7Animation: The Animation is pretty standard and about 30% of the show the main character is drawn in \'Chibi\' styled animation along with some of the other characters, although most of the time the majority of the characters are in standard art-style, The animation reaches its high points in the various fight scenes of the show and has a nice take on fire.SOUND: 7.5Sound: Both of the openings for this series were nice and there is one scene with the main female protagonist ""Ikaros"" singing which was also done nicely.ENJOYMENT: 8Easy to watch, quite funny and enjoyable.CHARACTERS:The Characters are fairly stereotypical for a harem ecchi anime, following a perverted boy and a collection of women with various breast sizes competing to love the protagonist.Overall Rating: 7.5The show is very enjoyable and easy to watch and is also not overly fan-serviced, even though the main character is a huge pervert and is always snooping around and looking up skirts etc, he also has the most \'aroused nose bleeds\' that I have seen in any anime to date. story\' and just follows many smaller arcs relating to each \'Angeloid\' and how they come to meet and form their relationships with Tomoki, It is also a very emphasized harem.ART: 7Animation: The Animation is pretty standard and about 30% of the show the main character is drawn in \'Chibi\' styled animation along with some of the other characters, although most of the time the majority of the characters are in standard art-style, The animation reaches its high points in the various fight scenes of the show and has a nice take on fire.SOUND: 7.5Sound: Both of the openings for this series were nice and there is one scene with the main female protagonist ""Ikaros"" singing which was also done nicely.ENJOYMENT: 8Easy to watch, quite funny and enjoyable.CHARACTERS:The Characters are fairly stereotypical for a harem ecchi anime, following a perverted boy and a collection of women with various breast sizes competing to love the protagonist.Overall Rating: 7.5The show is very enjoyable and easy to watch and is also not overly fan-serviced, even though the main character is a huge pervert and is always snooping around and looking up skirts etc, he also has the most \'aroused nose bleeds\' that I have seen in any anime to date.', ""Fun, beautiful, touching, epic, sad... and so on. Sora no Otoshimono is easily the best comedy / ecchi / romance anime out there! Well, I can not say the best as I've not seen all but one of the best at least. The story is fun and it takes a hold of you and doesn't let go. It has it all twists, perv humor, romance, character development, epic battles / action, sad moments that will make you cry and wanna punch stuff etc. The art is superb. It really is beautiful! At least for my taste! The music is amazing - arigatō mr Motoyoshi Iwasaki...and every other who had a part in making the amazing music. Oh, and I love Saori's voice, she truly was the perfect Ikaros! This anime has so many amazing characters I can't even name them all!

BUT, there is one major downside which is why I am not giving this one overall rating of 10.Anime is superb, but after forte... especially Final my master could have been done much much better. Check out my review of the 2. movie. But really. Angeloid of clockwork + 3. season. That would have been the dream come true, but we got 1 great movie and one 50 minute summary which even left out the beautiful ending which we saw in the manga! I mean, what the heck! I really feel like the creators rushed it and I would have truly enjoyed the 1. movie + 3. season of this amazing series. But besides all that, watch it and read it. You must.

The first start of this anime isn't bad, it seems like it would be a serious one with an actual plot, whether good or bad. But it then devolves into a myriad of mindless sexual innuendo with no concern whatsoever regarding the plot.The issue isn't the fact this is an ecchi anime but the fact that it lacks any sort of plot. It is just a collection of sexuality with no assembles of anything near logical. There is no music in this, characters aren't developed if to even say that...there is anything close to being called a character. Story? What,story. You can't even make sense of what is going on. there is anything close to being called a character. Story? What,story.

I think I\'ve grown ""numbed"" to ecchiness from childhood, so seeing boobs in my face wasn\'t a big deal and I didn\'t even give it a second thought. So my first-time watching this back in middle school was me just dropping my jaws at just how epic this show was and laughing my ass off at how funny it was. Though looking back on it, oh my god this show is so ecchi LOL, I don\'t know how I missed...it but I guess that just goes to show how invested I was to the characters of this show, rather than just for visual fanservice lol. Also I watched a lot of Crayon Shin-chan so maybe that\'s another reason why I didn\'t feel too bothered..Anyways! Yes, it\'s ecchi as fuck (just look at the anime poster for this), but as ecchi as it is, I love Ikaros and she deserves all the happiness in the world.This is a fairly ""old"" anime but even then, the action sequences from this show is STILL one of my favourites! Just watching these cute, but then all of a sudden badass angels fight with explosives and magic was just the coolest thing ever. This anime holds a nostalgic place for me, and even after all these years, I still remember having good memories from watching this.Oh but for real though, the ecchiness in this one is high lol.

Now.... it's time to look at girl's asses.I couldn't tell how I felt about watching this, I was disgusted, smiling (unironically), felt weirded out, and I felt bad. This anime couldn't tell whether to be a drama, love, action or comedic story. It can have all 4, but it lacks the potential. I will be talking about the Art, Genre, Characters, and the Story.Art: There are times when the art style is professionally made for action...and comedy, then most of the time it looks like a bunch of amateurs made a scene look boring. I wasn't too fond of the art style much, I also did not enjoy having the breasts of every woman 3 times bigger than their heads, it was easily distracting and loses focus of how serious some scenes show.Genre: There is easily three things that the Anime has, Comedy, Drama, and Romance. First off, the whole show was a whole comedic festival, but it didn't make me laugh once, rather, I did laugh, just not the way the show wanted. I'll get into why it wasn't funny at all when we get into the characters, but lets look over the drama. Hardly any drama, so why mention? Because there was a half of a season of one of the characters attempting to capture the fallen angel, but then there is troubling going on with the main character, as she grows a connection towards him and she doesn't seem to want to cause any harm. Another reason for drama is with the same character (who was trying to capture) going through troublesome times with her master. I'll get more into that later. Finally romance, there is a love triangle, two people try to find out what it's like to have emotions, it was boring and rushed over. Then there is action... I don't care for it.Characters: I would've gave this anime a 3 or a 4, but within half of the season, there was finally some character development and understanding of each character, let me describe the characters that show up the most.Sakurai: An energetic, pervert who is desperate to see nudity off of women. He's the main reason why this whole show wasn't funny once. The development of this character is like any pedophile anonymous character. I wouldn't have mind if he was a pervert, if he were to have the right ideas, or not an instant idiot. Then it wouldn't be so bad, but instead I question why people like this character in the first place.Ikaros: The story mostly revolves her facing herself and trying to act more human-like. Soon she is aware she is a weapon, but her master (Sakurai) denies her to use any source of violence against anyone. SO what does that leave her to be? An air head, quiet, and stubborn girl (not like a loli stubborn [yes, it's quite embarrassing to say loli], just stubborn as of making mistakes) As the anime moves forward, you kind of grow attach to this character, as she learns from her mistakes and tries to support everyone. But, the first half of the season is just her standing around and acting funny. Which didn't give me a chuckle.Nymph: She appears within half of the season, no introduction, nothing knowing about her, she just showed up, eating a bag of chips. I thought it was lazy, and appalling that this is how you introduce the next side character to this story. She does, however, develop character and you finally understand her. Which is great and makes her a likeable character. I have nothing much to say, other than, she's a good character.Sugata: At this point, these character share no interest whatsoever, they are just bland, boring, and backstaged characters who are there for fun. This character, believes there is a new world among earth, and wishes to explore it. However, we mostly get to see him goofing around in a serious manner,  he somehow manages to get alot of info through technology, which doesn't make any sense, and he always hangs out with the characters with no purpose, he just sits there, watches people. It's pointless.Mitsuki: Another Bland and boring character, she is violent, nice, and has a crush on Sakurai. However, Sakurai always has a dirty mind while seeing Mitsuki, and it clearly shows, therefore, she becomes violent against him. It gets old real fast, and it feels pointless. Remove this character, and nothing changes. Moving on.Satsukitane: The final character, and I must say, she is the most uninteresting character in this whole story. She's there because she is there. She is.... I don't know what she is, other than what I assume, she loves to play with people. That's it, and it's a piss poor job to try to bring up a character that is a woman and does absolutely nothing other than bring comedy.Story: There was no main focus the whole first season, it was just a montage of boring, pornish, comedic episodes which were cringy and facepalming. Finally, after Nymph shows up out of nowhere, things get interesting. The main plot is that the angels from above are trying to bring back Ikaros back from earth, but is challenging because she refuses, therefore it leads toward violence and drama. A few sub plots here and there, Ikaros tries to find the meaning of life as a human, and as well as Nymph. The story isn't big, but it's enough to create a decent show.Usually when I rate things a 5, I would've said it's ok to watch and I'm sure you'll probably enjoy it better than I did. In all of honesty, I disliked this show, I gave it a 5, because it showed characters and a plot. If you think you'll enjoy the comedy, then you'll rate it higher than I did. I won't recommend anyone watching this, if you are up for the challenge of watching this mix up of an anime, go ahead. I'm not going back to this one.This anime is rated a 5, nothing more, luckily nothing less. and comedy, then most of the time it looks like a bunch of amateurs made a scene look boring.

Also you should watch Sora no otoshimono forte the sequal ', ""Personally, this anime is amazing. It is hilarious most of the time and yet it also has some really serious and really emotional moments. Yes, there is a LOT of fanservice and it does go overboard with that, but that adds to the humor. And with the main premise being about the biggest pervert of all time getting, essentially, a Fairly Odd-Parent to do whatever he wants, you kind of expect these kinds of wacky and hilarious situations. But then the darker parts, with the people in the New World being the worst people in existence, really get to me- it makes for a really...good contrast between the comedy and the seriousness. And while I might've wanted a bit more of the serious scenes, I still love this show. good contrast between the comedy and the seriousness.

Sora no Otoshimono is an echhi anime, but one of the few echhi...anime that has a good story accompanied with nice character development. The comedy is also awesome.The main character, Tomoki, a normal high school teenager who also happens to be a pervert, sees a girl in his dreams who tells him about how she is trapped in the sky and asks him to save her. His senpai Eishiro Sugata, an intelligent bespectacled boy who is a member of the New World Discovery Club, is searching for a new world in the skies and finds out about a black void in the sky which is travelling along the earth. He finds out that the black void is going to be somewhere close to where they live. When Tomoki along with his childhood friend, Sohara Mitsuki, a busty girl who has a crush on him (clichéd as hell though), visit Sugata about Tomoki's dreams, he asks them to come to the site where the new world is going to be.

He tries to save her but is saved by her instead.This girl is an angeloid called Icarus. She tells Tomoki about how he is her master and how she can grant any wish of his.

The overarching plot involves the Angeloids, what they are, where they came from, and what they want to do, particularly focusing on the two Angeloids Ikaros and Nymph, and it does a really good job with both. Ikaros's character arc is focused on her being something that she doesn't want to be, but trying her to...best to keep that hidden and act as what she does want to be, a normal human, in order to stay with her friends. This one felt a little weak, in that it was essentially all resolved in that Tomoki would accept her no matter what towards the end of the season, but her worrying over it and the ultimate resolution still resulted in what felt like strong character development. Nymph more so was the true star though, in that her arc was related to her being dependent on a master who she didn't like, but at the same time was afraid of, with a bit of her just naturally wanting a master to obey as well due to her nature, but also really wanting to be free. This led to conflict with Ikaros as well as Synapse, with her feeling tremendously conflicted, but the season ends with a brilliant resolution to all of this, while also setting her up for more to come. The story was genuinely interesting, all on it's own, with characters you could really sympathize with and villains that were really easy to hate, though ultimately nothing happens to them disappointingly enough.The thing though, is that the plot moves really slowly, but the reason for that is that it blends the plot with comedy very well. The plot is very character oriented, and hence to make it work it requires the viewer to be very attached to Ikaros and Nymph. How it goes about doing so is through the human cast of characters. The cast is pretty interesting, with a perverted main character, violent tsundere childhood friend, genius senpai, and sadistic student council president. They aren't fleshed out very well nor do they get much development as compared to the Angeloids, which is my biggest disappointment with the show to be honest. But they help bring out a large number of interesting situations that are incredibly amusing. The comedy is really amusing in it's own right, and though it gets a little bit repetitive as it goes on, overall slowly but surely, it helps the viewer get really invested in the two Angeloids. And hence, that makes the serious aspects from the plot have a really strong impact when in the end, it all comes to a climax.I liked the designs and art style. The art and animation itself felt like they didn't age all that well though. The OP is solid, the soundtrack is okay, and the insert song was used really well. It did this thing where it used different EDs for every episode, with most of them being a joke, but it was pretty hit and miss.

That's not too much to ask, right? Well, one boy's wish is granted... sort of, in the form of a girl who fell from the sky! Now referring to him as her master, he uses his new servant to help him accomplish all the perverted escapades most teenage boys can only dream of getting away with, while trying to cling to the hope of regaining his beloved peace and quiet.Art (10/10) - Art comes in many forms. That's especially true in anime. Some are good, and some are... not as good. In...this case, I felt the animation was atheistically pleasing to look at. Something else that I enjoyed was the little-transition between scenes. It was a nice, fluid change from the usual pan-up found in most other anime.Sound (10/10) - I found the first few words of the Intro caught my ear. It truly spoke about the strangeness of one's own beating heart, and what causes it to do so. As each episode ends, one would expect it to cut to the credits with a nice song. This anime does, but also provides imagery of the highlights of the episode. You can really feel the emotions of the characters.Character (10/10) - You have your typical high school pervert, childhood best friend, eccentric genius, somewhat sadistic Class President, and two mysterious girls with wings. Quite the cast.The main character drive, for me, was watching Ikaros try to adapt and become more human for her master while watching Nymph struggle with her identity and what she really wants in life.Enjoyment (10/10) - One of the funniest moments of this anime is when Tomoki is being his usual pervy-self, and then has to pay for it, usually from the curtesy of his best friend. Some of the situations the cast is in is usually outlandish, but that's how things generally are in a Harem/Ecchi anime.Overall (10/10) - This show has been sitting on my Plan to Watch list for a while, and I'm so glad that I finally got around to watching it. Within the first episode or two, I knew this was going to be a favorite. I was sad, yet excited when this came to an end.

"", ""Review #7: Heaven's Lost PropertyStory 8/10 -- This rating might scratch a few peoples heads, but I can guarantee you that it's a valid score. The Angeloids are higher beings from another world, and theres actually a lot of subtle Sci-fi, mystery, and intrigue in this series. This is one of the few stories ive seen in the harem genre that  contains emphatic pain, not only towards the angels but to the humans as well. The beginning of this series was great foreshadowing, with the nature of ecchi deluding viewers from the actual story surrounding this world. Truthfully, danger awaits are protagonists, but its...always played off by bountiful distractions, leaving a hidden intrigue for viewers who enjoy future problems in the story.Art 7/10 -- This show had pretty good color effects for 2009. It was bright, the backgrounds were nice, the comedy artwork was on point, and I didn't have to many complaints about visuals for this season. I would say that the show overused ecchi a bit, and I actually enjoyed Tomoki being his normal size rather then his ball form.Sound 8/10 -- I loved the uses of multiple different songs in this series for the ED. The OP was a great soundtrack to listen to as well. The dialogue was pretty good, although i thought Nymph could have used more. There was a lot of comedic fun in this series, and that made the dialogue enjoyable as well.Character 7/10 -- The character development is pretty decent, but its better towards the ending. Ikaros changes more towards the end, which really makes Nymph the main Angeloid with depth in this season. I enjoyed the human relationship between Mikako and Eishirou, and they were pretty good supporting/main characters. Sohara was the weakest main character, which is common among childhood friend tropes. Her role was awkward and pretty cliche, but the human characters make up for the shortcoming. Tomoki did well for a harem protagonist. His perverse scenes were amusing, but I also liked his way of thinking towards others, and he slowly realizies theres more to life then quiet isolation.Enjoyment 7/10 -- It's an ecchi harem anime. It's marketed towards young adults. However I enjoy the surprisingly good story this series offers, with angels dropping down from heaven, and heavens role truly being questioned multiple times over. What makes my enjoyment score drop for this series is how crazy the ecchi becomes. You have a storyline that can be well received, you have plenty of girls that have the popularity. This series did not need to focus on ecchi for majority of an episode to be enjoyable. The characters had good development, the girls were liked, and we already knew ecchi scenes would be coming, it's that type of anime. But again, that's no reason to take away from a good story, and it lowers my enjoyment. A better balance of plot and ecchi would have made this season better.Overall 7/10 -- The Story and sound were very good, with the dialogue being entertaining, and the music was top notch for 2009. Heavens lost property did a great job pushing things further and further, outside of the MC's comfort zone, and it ruined a quiet life anime with some mild action scenes that develop into important matters in season 2. The weakness of the first season is the overuse of ecchi to take away from the storyline and character personality. I found though that looking past that, while also looking deeper into the plot, gives a positive impression of this anime series, and season 2 nor the movies were disappointing to watch either. It's a solid 7.5 out of 10, a good example of what anime needs and doesn't need to be good or very good.~Castawayz always played off by bountiful distractions, leaving a hidden intrigue for viewers who enjoy future problems in the story.Art 7/10 -- This show had pretty good color effects for 2009.

I then move up or down accordingly so as to give the show a fair chance in its own right. It's not a perfect system, as I will likely not bother watching a show 4 and below. But it allows me to review each anime on an individual, one to one basis.I recently started rewatching Sora no Otoshimono after a brief conversation I had with a friend about it. I never grew up on Sora no Otoshimono, but...it feels like I could have. I strangely feel a sense of nostalgia for the series.SnO is an eechi comedy, with some honestly pretty impressively animated fight scenes sprinkled throughout. The humor of the show all stems from its ability to exaggerate situations to a rediculous degree (Such as military fighter jets being called in for a naked man in public). I can honestly say that, apart from SnO, very few shows have been able to pull off this style of humor successfully. It's pretty unique.I think a lot of this stems from the characters. Every single one is memorable. At first I found Tomoki, the main male character insufferable. But now I think he really carries the show. He is such an intentionally deplorable, perverted character, that it's always hilarious when he inevitably gets what's coming to him everytime.The girls are all cute/waifu-material. But I honestly think Mikako might be my second favorite character (not saying she's best girl, just second favorite overall character.) She was mostly a reoccuring side character in the manga, but takes a much more consistent role in the anime, which I'm glad they made that change. She creates outrageous situations, purely because she enjoys chaos. She is comedically sadistic, but is clearly shown to have a caring side through her actions.If you like eechi comedies, and can get behind outrageous, perverted male humor, this show might be for you.

It sounded interesting and good. Started watching the first season and liked it for the most part. The main characters pervyness and stupidity was too exaggerated for my taste but those parts were spread out enough that you could overlook it and the main story and the other characters held it up to some extant. Than I started watching the second season and it was so poor that I started clicking my way thru the episodes just \'cause I wanted to know the conclusion. The main ""protagonist"" devolved from the overly pervy and stupid kid he was...in the first season into what I can only describe as an unappealing, antisocial serial rapist in the making. 80% of the second season he\'s drawn as a three year old and is depicted as someone that anyone and everyone would want to beat with a baseball bat. I mean... it is an anime and one should consider that it\'s not meant for realism but no person in their right mind could have enough imagination to think that every one he ever meets wouldn\'t want to instantly kill him, much less that anyone would like him. It\'s really to bad because if they had made that main char just a bit less of an a**hole this could have been really good since the storyline was so promising but the ""protagonist"" drags the whole show down with him.I\'ll finish up with an example of how ""challenged"" the main char is: He has a really beautiful and sexy angeloid who is, in effect, his slave. She has told him very clearly that she would do ANYTHING for him. And he\'s is VERY aware of this. It\'s been made REALLY clear. And yet he seems to see her as part of the furniture and instead tries to peek on or molest every other girl but her and really trying to make everyone hate him.

Subete ga F ni Naru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28621/Subete_ga_F_ni_Naru,"['It’s not easy to watch a show like “The Perfect Insider”. Generally speaking, the show is about mystery and in this case involves murder. It’s something that can be a sensitive topic as we learn more about the circumstances. And given the mystery aspect of the show, it’s the narratives that captures the essence of story. Really though, what is The Perfect Insider?Subete ga F ni Naru (also more commonly known as The Perfect Insider) is based on a Japanese mystery novel written in 1996 by Hiroshi Mori. Produced by A-1 Pictures, the show is symbolic for how mystery can be so…mysterious. The setting...takes place on a remote island and begins when Souhei Saikawa, an associate professor of National Nagono University, goes on a vacation there. During his vacation, he is also accompanied by 1st year student, Moe Nishinosono. What started out as an ordinary trip turns bizarre when a mysterious corpse shows up at the lab. At the same time, it also became well known that a woman named Shiki Magata lives there. As one of the most mysterious characters in the show, she has literally lived in a laboratory for the past 15 years. Can you imagine that? Trapping themselves like a rat in a box hardly sounds like a paradise. For someone like Magata, there’s also a dark past that involves the parricide of her parents. It’s the establishment of these three characters that makes The Perfect Insider a dark and grimy tale.It’s a very talky show. The first episode has an immense amount of philosophical vibe that follows with its heavy dialogues. The character interactions between Moe/Magata and Moe/Souhei can be described as cryptic. There’s some lighthearted humor as well but mostly follow a suit of dark comedy. When they reach the island, there’s also more of an experimental feeling as if there’s something that’s hidden there. It’s not long before they discover the grim truth there. What the show also concentrates a bit on is the background story of Shiki Magata. Obviously, she isn’t a normal woman by the way she talks or behaves. The bits of past we see implies that she is an unstable child although her actions are difficult to decipher because of her personality. [spoiler]This includes her involvement with the death of her parents as well as the perverse relationship she forges with her uncle.[/spoiler] I think at some point, viewers may find it unsettling with what they witness. And that’s no surprise either considering how much we learn that Magata is far from normal.Throughout the series, there are many clues that has connections with the murder case. It’s also apparent that some of the clues are presented through intentional means. One of the most prominent is a message called ‘Everything Becomes F’, which is also synonymous with the series’ alternate title. What’s more about the clues is that they are all seems to be related to Shiki Magata. What I find the show intriguing is how each episode’s performance triggers events that correlates with one another. Even the episode titles has some sort of meaning or is symbolic with the storytelling. Some sensitive topics are used as plot devices and while can be unsettling is important to establish Magata’s character. On a weaker note, the show has a slow pacing, one that I think can really test the patience of viewers. Furthermore, the story is structured in a way that explores both Moe and Magata in almost parallel ways. As the story progresses, we also learn a bit more about Moe as well. While her personality is not similar to Magata or Souhei, something suggests that her past isn’t as bright as some people have hoped.The main character interactions of the show is expressed by the building tension and relations one draws from another. Moe’s conversation with Souhei can be interpreted from many angles but it’s obvious that he shows a great deal of bizarre interest in Magata. Moe’s interest with Souhei also crafts a bizarre relationship angle as Magata shows unusual interest in Moe. It’s a really weird way of presenting the story and I’d have to advise to watch the show with an open mind. Not just because of the main characters but also for some of the more mature and sensitive topics. Otherwise, this is probably a show that is not worth the investment especially considering how talkative it is. There’s still also some minor comedy although mostly is far eclipsed by the thrilling feeling of its mystery.For a mystery show, it also invests a decent amount of time with its unusual artwork. There’s a hollow feeling that anyone can draw from its backgrounds. Most characters are also designed to look simple without unusual features. Well, that is until you see Makata Shiki. Additionally, the show portrays its mystery with symbolism and disorder. The clues translates into a more detailed form of analysis such as the message Magata left behind or more prominent features Moe herself discovers later on in the show. To put it simply, artwork is unorthodox but also stylistically fitting for a show like this.I have to admit a bit, the soundtrack is surprisingly impressive. From the unusual execution of the OP song (that features rotoscope done effectively) to the thrilling atmosphere, each episode offers what mystery should be. More intensified scenes are also adapted with quietness to add on more to the thrilling suspense. In addition, character voice mannerisms has a profound tone of philosophy behind them. In particular, Souhei speaks with intelligence and purpose and that’s something I find quite compelling. Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to apply to Moe as she can be legitimately frustrating to watch with someone of her personality. And of course, there’s Magata. Her conversation portrayed in the show through that near-sinister like voice really can feel mysterious.The Perfect Insider is a show with some unique dynamics even in the mystery genre. From disturbing plot devices to insightful conversations, it’s a series that goes beyond just a simple murder case. It becomes complex with its dark themes, the riveting style of the storytelling, and heavy characterization. The first three episodes will probably be a make or break for most viewers. But if you manage to stay, it’ll be a thrilling ride that is not short of perfect. takes place on a remote island and begins when Souhei Saikawa, an associate professor of National Nagono University, goes on a vacation there.

Can’t say I’ve been a big fan of the time slot’s constant deaths and revivals to the point that Jean Grey is thinking there’s something wrong with it, and considering that nobody likes The Perfect Insider but people who seem to think that good dialogue automatically equals quality, I don’t think I’m going to be breaking many hearts when I say that I’m not exactly enthusiastic about having to review the show. But hey, regardless of quality, I think most of us can agree it’s still worth talking about. Not to mention, I get to...slap those “novel adaptations are always good” heathens around, so win/win.Based on the third or fourth novel in the S&M (Sohei and Moe) series - which I haven’t read, but The Perfect Insider seems to assume its audience has because it doesn’t even bother to tell us who our two leads are - the anime stars our two title characters as they head to an island retreat for a university vacation where thanks to the almighty god that is the mystery writer, a murder happens Detective Conan-style and the two must figure out what’s going on. The series also has a live-action drama that was criticized for being slow-paced, but upon further research, I discovered it actually adapts five novels worth of material within its ten-episode run, which makes me wonder just what the fuck is in these novels that makes them such a tedious chore even when you only have an hour or so to tell the story. Yes it should come to no surprise considering it’s A-1, but for an 11-episode series The Perfect Insider is ridiculously long. And it doesn’t even have any uninspired world-building to fall back on as an excuse. It’s just long for no good reason whatsoever.The thing about mysteries is that once you know the truth behind ‘em, they cease to be “mysteries” and instead become uninteresting. As such, the bad ones generally rely on the brain-teasing to entice the audience whilst the good ones tie the mystery into other things in order to stay relevant in the long run. Maybe explore the personalities of our main characters. Rope the mystery into some larger plot. Have the villain be a well-respected figure who was turned into a bad guy for no good reason. Basically do everything Paranoia Agent did. You’ll be pleased to hear that not only does Perfect Insider not do any of these things, but the mystery itself doesn’t even make sense. It’s like the guy who was adapting the source material realized he ordered too many timeslots, but rather than actually add anything to the adaptation like, say, telling us who the fuck Sohei and Moe are, he just turned on an episode of Monogatari, became engaged in what he was seeing, and yelled “brilliant!” And then he saw the mystery made no sense in the novel and went “oh who the fuck cares?”There’s so much boring redundant dialogue in this show that it takes three episodes for the mystery to even fucking start. And even with the long stretches of time spent on talking me to sleep, the show is incredibly lacking in detail. The characters react to deaths the same way a normal person would react to a mosquito bite, and everyone gets free rein of the place like they don’t care that there’s a murderer among them to the point that it felt like they were reading the script. Not to mention that what little we see of the victim’s history does a pretty good job at making me glad that she’s dead because she’s fucking psychotic. Maybe it’s just me, but I find it hard to sympathize with someone who’d kill their family out of nowhere whilst looking like she inhaled two bags of coke. And explain to me where all that AI stuff came from and what it added to the story besides a load of bananas.With that said, the show’s total commitment to treating fucked-up relationships and psychic programs as a normal thing was entertaining at points, mainly because it kept making me laugh. Well, not “laugh” persay. More like snicker at the idea that someone can say that children grow to kill their parents at the age of fifteen like it’s a normal thing to happen. I guess now we know what happened to all the parents in every single highschool anime ever, amirite? Unfortunately, the amount of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is in a vast minority compared to the ones that are either spouting exposition or talking about Moe’s desires to bone her teacher silly. Which is also kind of unintentionally hilarious in a way. I guess spouting out quantum physics when someone asks you where the rewind button on the Xbone controller is located is considered sexy to some people.My point is this: shows that try to get by on dialogue alone are shit. Because animation is a visual medium and not using the visuals to tell the story is like not having gameplay in your video game. That’s right, The Perfect Insider is the anime version of those walking simulator games. The ones where you play as some nameless being trying to find the plot without any challenge in-between the exposition dumps to the point that it feels like you’re reading a book that was chopped into pieces and scattered across the world so that it takes an awfully long time and money to figure out how the story ends. Forgive me for being old-fashioned, but when I buy a book, I prefer to have the entire thing at my disposal and not have to buy a new chapter every time I go to a new book store. If I had to do that, Huckleberry Finn would have taken three years to finish reading.Plus, why should I care about the dialogue when it’s being spoken by a bunch of dull drama stereotypes with no personal story or stakes in the mystery whatsoever? Did anyone ever watch LA Confidential and thought it would have been improved if you replaced Guy Pearce with some random kid genius who has no connection with the police force and just said what the audience was thinking whilst discovering the dead body underneath the house? Of course not. Because that kid would have been really fucking boring! I don’t watch anime to see people react to things. I watch anime to see people doing things. And I can’t remember one thing Sohei and Moe ever did besides wonder what was going on and then eventually figure out the truth in one long info-dump before going about their lives.I mean did this experience change them? Did they go through any character growth throughout the series? Did they have any personal connection with the victim? I remember Moe talking with her once and that was it. Why exactly are Sohei and Moe the main characters if they’re not going to affect the story? Even Benedict Cumberbatch had to match personal wits with the otherwise-unconnected criminals he faces at the end of each episode of Sherlock.Fair warning to all my readers. I’m going to spoil the plot of this show now, because I can’t get deep into its silliness otherwise. After more than eight episodes of exposition-dumping along with one really bad Engrish scene that grated my ears harder than the voice-acting in a post-90s Sonic game, the show decides to reveal through several overly long and tensionless exposition scenes that absolutely none of the characters we met along the way was the culprit and that the person they thought was the victim was actually a look-alike who killed herself because fifteen years of planning couldn’t stand up to the words that came out of Moe’s mouth. The original plan was to have both the intended victim and her husband killed because they lived fucked up lives and apparently this is their way of seeking redemption rather than - oh, I don’t know - turning themselves in. Instead, the intended murderer killed herself, the intended victim escapes the island, she shows up one last time to tell Sohei that she won’t get caught, we get a final episode consisting of nothing but tying up loose ends rather than giving me some actual payoff, and then the show ends with a scene consisting of the intended victim and the actual victim talking about the meaning of life.So in other words, assuming that load of boring plot dump doesn’t put you to sleep, the only character who gets any sort of resolution out of this ridiculously long mystery is the unlikeable and uninteresting murderer we barely got to know, and it’s an incredibly anticlimactic one as well. Somewhere in Hell, Albert Wesker from Resident Evil is watching this show (and I have it on good authority that Satan allows his followers to watch anime in Hell) and going “dude, I was treated with more dignity than this. And I was killed by a muscleman and his incredibly stupid black sidekick who’d waste valuable health sprays on you if you so much as got a paper cut.” slap those “novel adaptations are always good” heathens around, so win/win.Based on the third or fourth novel in the S&M (Sohei and Moe) series - which I haven’t read, but The Perfect Insider seems to assume its audience has because it doesn’t even bother to tell us who our two leads are - the anime stars our two title characters as they head to an island retreat for a university vacation where thanks to the almighty god that is the mystery writer, a murder happens Detective Conan-style and the two must figure out what’s going on.

It’s like the guy who was adapting the source material realized he ordered too many timeslots, but rather than actually add anything to the adaptation like, say, telling us who the fuck Sohei and Moe are, he just turned on an episode of Monogatari, became engaged in what he was seeing, and yelled “brilliant!” And then he saw the mystery made no sense in the novel and went “oh who the fuck cares?”There’s so much boring redundant dialogue in this show that it takes three episodes for the mystery to even fucking start. And even with the long stretches of time spent on talking me to sleep, the show is incredibly lacking in detail. The characters react to deaths the same way a normal person would react to a mosquito bite, and everyone gets free rein of the place like they don’t care that there’s a murderer among them to the point that it felt like they were reading the script. Not to mention that what little we see of the victim’s history does a pretty good job at making me glad that she’s dead because she’s fucking psychotic. Maybe it’s just me, but I find it hard to sympathize with someone who’d kill their family out of nowhere whilst looking like she inhaled two bags of coke. And explain to me where all that AI stuff came from and what it added to the story besides a load of bananas.With that said, the show’s total commitment to treating fucked-up relationships and psychic programs as a normal thing was entertaining at points, mainly because it kept making me laugh. Well, not “laugh” persay. More like snicker at the idea that someone can say that children grow to kill their parents at the age of fifteen like it’s a normal thing to happen. I guess now we know what happened to all the parents in every single highschool anime ever, amirite? Unfortunately, the amount of unintentionally hilarious dialogue is in a vast minority compared to the ones that are either spouting exposition or talking about Moe’s desires to bone her teacher silly. Which is also kind of unintentionally hilarious in a way. I guess spouting out quantum physics when someone asks you where the rewind button on the Xbone controller is located is considered sexy to some people.My point is this: shows that try to get by on dialogue alone are shit. Because animation is a visual medium and not using the visuals to tell the story is like not having gameplay in your video game. That’s right, The Perfect Insider is the anime version of those walking simulator games. The ones where you play as some nameless being trying to find the plot without any challenge in-between the exposition dumps to the point that it feels like you’re reading a book that was chopped into pieces and scattered across the world so that it takes an awfully long time and money to figure out how the story ends. Forgive me for being old-fashioned, but when I buy a book, I prefer to have the entire thing at my disposal and not have to buy a new chapter every time I go to a new book store. If I had to do that, Huckleberry Finn would have taken three years to finish reading.Plus, why should I care about the dialogue when it’s being spoken by a bunch of dull drama stereotypes with no personal story or stakes in the mystery whatsoever? Did anyone ever watch LA Confidential and thought it would have been improved if you replaced Guy Pearce with some random kid genius who has no connection with the police force and just said what the audience was thinking whilst discovering the dead body underneath the house? Of course not. Because that kid would have been really fucking boring! I don’t watch anime to see people react to things. I watch anime to see people doing things. And I can’t remember one thing Sohei and Moe ever did besides wonder what was going on and then eventually figure out the truth in one long info-dump before going about their lives.I mean did this experience change them? Did they go through any character growth throughout the series? Did they have any personal connection with the victim? I remember Moe talking with her once and that was it. Why exactly are Sohei and Moe the main characters if they’re not going to affect the story? Even Benedict Cumberbatch had to match personal wits with the otherwise-unconnected criminals he faces at the end of each episode of Sherlock.Fair warning to all my readers. I’m going to spoil the plot of this show now, because I can’t get deep into its silliness otherwise. After more than eight episodes of exposition-dumping along with one really bad Engrish scene that grated my ears harder than the voice-acting in a post-90s Sonic game, the show decides to reveal through several overly long and tensionless exposition scenes that absolutely none of the characters we met along the way was the culprit and that the person they thought was the victim was actually a look-alike who killed herself because fifteen years of planning couldn’t stand up to the words that came out of Moe’s mouth. The original plan was to have both the intended victim and her husband killed because they lived fucked up lives and apparently this is their way of seeking redemption rather than - oh, I don’t know - turning themselves in. Instead, the intended murderer killed herself, the intended victim escapes the island, she shows up one last time to tell Sohei that she won’t get caught, we get a final episode consisting of nothing but tying up loose ends rather than giving me some actual payoff, and then the show ends with a scene consisting of the intended victim and the actual victim talking about the meaning of life.So in other words, assuming that load of boring plot dump doesn’t put you to sleep, the only character who gets any sort of resolution out of this ridiculously long mystery is the unlikeable and uninteresting murderer we barely got to know, and it’s an incredibly anticlimactic one as well. Somewhere in Hell, Albert Wesker from Resident Evil is watching this show (and I have it on good authority that Satan allows his followers to watch anime in Hell) and going “dude, I was treated with more dignity than this. And I was killed by a muscleman and his incredibly stupid black sidekick who’d waste valuable health sprays on you if you so much as got a paper cut.”', 'The Perfect Insider is what I would like to call the first \'proper\' mystery anime I\'ve seen in quite some time. By \'proper\' I don\'t mean to say that it\'s amazing per se, but that it actually follows the best story design for the genre. That is to say, it takes its time to give the viewers all the details you could ever ask for as well as plenty of red herrings, it doesn\'t blatantly break the rules of detective fiction like certain other recent works, and it is also not episodic in any way. It gives you a fair chance to reflect on the...case at hand and try to figure out the problem on your own, and it doesn\'t try to include any needless supernatural elements in the process. It\'s just 11 episodes of content all dedicated to a single in-depth mystery, and as a result it actually feels like a traditional detective story. It\'s simple, but very effective.Based on a mystery novel of the same name from 1996, The Perfect Insider follows the cryptic death of a genius computer scientist named Magata Shiki, who has been locked up in an isolated research facility on an island for the last 15 years after having been accused of murdering her own parents as a teenager. Nishinosono Moe, a rich young lady, and the university professor Saikawa Souhei travel together to the island with the hopes of meeting Shiki in person, only to find her dead inside her room upon arriving, with her arms and legs cut off. Based on the guards\' testimony as well as the security camera footage, it is clear that no one else ever entered or left Shiki\'s quarters. So who killed her, how and why? Those are the main questions which the story revolves around. In other words, at heart it\'s a classic \'locked room\' problem. Though that\'s not all there is to it since as you\'ll find out, the case only escalates even further from that point onwards...Now since mysteries are very spoiler-sensitive I don\'t really want to say anything more than that about the story, but I can at least say that while the overall plotline didn\'t exactly blow my mind... I still found it very satisfying. The most important part of a good mystery is to give the viewers a fair chance at figuring out the problem before the truth is revealed, and The Perfect Insider does a good job at that. Part of the solution is actually not that difficult to figure out on your own, but the whole thing? Yeah I don\'t think very many people were able to do that, but it all made sense when I finally heard the explanation, and that\'s all I can really ever ask for.Shiki herself is unquestionably the most interesting character of the anime as is made evident when the others slowly but surely come to realize who she used to be whilst investigating the case. She\'s crazy, but unbelievably intelligent. As far as Saikawa-sensei and Moe goes though... I can\'t help but feel like they\'re utilized more as plot mechanics than actual persons. Saikawa-sensei quite simply fulfills the role of the detective of the case. To quote one of the 20 rules of detective fiction: ""The detective novel must have a detective in it; and a detective is not a detective unless he detects. His function is to gather clues that will eventually lead to the person who did the dirty work in the first chapter; and if the detective does not reach his conclusions through an analysis of those clues, he has no more solved his problem than the schoolboy who gets his answer out of the back of the arithmetic."" And that is effectively all he does: logically solving the problem, one step at a time. Beyond that he\'s honestly a quite bland and uninspiring character, but at least he fulfills the role that the story has given him very well. Moe on the other hand is the intermediary character who  is there to ensure that the viewers are able to follow along and don\'t get confused, by not being quite as sharp as Saikawa-sensei is, and thus making him have to explain most of his discoveries vocally to her, thus indirectly informing the audience in the process as well. And all the other side characters... well they\'re mostly just \'there\', not a whole lot more to say about them.The Perfect Insider is produced by A-1 Pictures of all studios, which is pretty unexpected in and of itself since this is hardly the kind of series they usually adapt. They pretty much always make shounen anime, but this time they\'re tackling a philosophical seinen mystery instead. But either way, they do a surprisingly good job at it, and the animation is as top notch as ever as well. Something that might be worth mentioning here as well is that the character designs are actually made by Asano Inio, the mangaka of Oyasumi Punpun and Solanin among other things. And although The Perfect Insider perhaps doesn\'t look *that* crazy relatively speaking, you can still really see who the artist is. It\'s just too characteristic to be unnoticeable.In the end, The Perfect Insider might be very dialogue-heavy and slow-paced, but I still found significantly more consistent enjoyment value in this anime than almost anything else from this season, mostly because it actually feels like a real mystery for once. Like a legitimately interesting one which teases your imagination and makes you think for yourself. It\'s surprising just how rare that is to see in anime, but it means quite a lot to me. So even though the mystery in this case might not have been completely flawless, it\'s still a hell of a lot better than getting nothing at all.

I\'ll just take what I can get.', 'So, it seems that this anime was a hit more miss with most, who watched. I personally enjoyed the show thoroughly from beginning to end. What seems to be the ""problem"" that most people point out is that the characters are unrealistic or that they are just idiots trying to act smart but I didn\'t see it that way at all. Agree or disagree I will give you my 2 cents about this series.I will start with first with the [b]Characters[/b].If you don\'t like \'different/perfect\' characters, you won\'t enjoy the show.Our lead protagonist Saikawa is a professor at a college but his personality is anything...but normal, he is very anti social and spends his time thinking about the way humans think and why they think that way. He is curious why people do many things for no reason.His mentality is detached from society\'s typical way of thinking, the way he questions anything and everything would make most people in society look at him like he was crazy. I personally saw his statements as realistic questions to be asked.""Every morning I wake up and think am I the same Saikawa I was yesterday? Or am I just trying to play the role of Saikawa?"".""In here it feels like we\'ve been abandoned by time.""""Isn\'t \'released from\' a better phrase as opposed to \'abandoned by\'""""Seeing nature and thinking its beautiful is what is unnatural""""In the end, everybody is tied down to their one body, don\'t you find that terribly restrictive?""I enjoyed his character because he would say things no other main character would say. Which was something great to me.Female lead protagonist Moe, a math genius who can answer any math question immediately, she is also an unusual character, she isn\'t quite as curious as Saikawa when it comes humans but she tags along with him. Her above average intellect helps conversations with this unusual male lead to make some sense. Saikawa can\'t talk to somebody who refuses to share the same train of though.Lastly the main focus of the series, is a woman who is a super genius named Magata. She is world famous for being super smart at the age of 11 and thus they locked her in a room so that she can work alone, for 15 years. Her character is similar to that of Saikawa in that she  questions the human train of thought and emotions. Her train of thought is similar to Saikawa as well.If you can\'t stand \'different/perfect\' characters with drastic world views then do not watch this show.[b]Story[/b]The two leads go to the island where the famous Dr. Magata works, and the fact that Moe\'s family is well known, they are let in upon arriving. When they  enter a murder is committed where the limbs of the body are missing. Although Saikawa prefers to leave Moe convinces him to stay and help figure out this murder mystery.Not much to say about it in general except, I felt that the revelation of the murder and how they get there is enjoyable. The reasoning behind the murder might be acceptable for you depending on what kind of person are you. Like I said before the characters mainly determine how your enjoyment of this series will go.[b]Sound[/b]Great fantastic awesome whatever. The music was great in this series OP and ED.

If you think that OPM is the anime of the season, then I recommend you to avoid this show like the plague.[b]In Conclusion[/b]Subete ga F ni Naru is a show that requires your undivided attention, missing the smallest of details can change how you view it. I don’t blame you for not liking it. It is a metaphysical journey that’s more about exploring its concepts than anything. It isn’t meant to be taken at face value and demands you to pay attention to understand it. It’s a show that touches upon the human condition and finding one’s purpose in life.

When the illness is cured, life vanishes."" Shiki Magata(This is just a brief touch of the pretense contained in this show)- The Perfect Insider -Story: 5The biggest issue with Perfect Insider\'s story isn\'t the mystery itself, no- the biggest issue plaguing this show is the Anime Logic™. Apparently Hiroshi Mori didn\'t even bother to do a cursory search for any kind of legal books, case law, or anything regarding the legality of murder and subsequent judicial proceedings of someone accused and convicted of such.In his stead, I...did my own research, which turned up some very strange findings. Case law for Japan is very difficult to find, and even more rare in English; however, the cases that are involved are typically public information, excepting those involving minors- similarly to the US.In Japan, they do not follow the M\'naghten rule- that is, in an insanity plea, where the distinction must be made of a person who is accused of a crime as to whether they were insane at the time of the CRIME, or insane at the time of the TRIAL. The goal is to determine whether temporary insanity or claims of insanity to try and get off are valid. If someone is determined insane at the time of the trial, the trial is then postponed and they are involuntarily committed to a mental institution until such a time that they are deemed competent to stand trial, if ever. Time spent in said asylum counts as time served in the event that they are convicted after being found competent.In 2001, a man in Osaka went into an elementary school and stabbed 8 children to death, and injured another 13 children and two teachers. He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, BPD, and PPD. He was sentenced to death by hanging, and it was carried out in 2004.In 2007, a 16 year old girl murdered her father with an axe in Kyoto. Because the case involved a minor, few details are available, but it\'s almost certain that she walked free. ""I didn\'t like my father so I killed him,"" Kyodo news agency quoted the girl as saying.-Japan allows this kind of thing.In 2008, a man drove a truck into a crowd in Akihabara and killed three people, got out, stabbed and killed four more, injuring an additional 10 people before being apprehended. He was then RELEASED FROM POLICE CUSTODY after two days, and rearrested 10 DAYS LATER. He was sentenced to death in 2011, upheld in 2015.What Japan does (because of deep seated cultural norms and customs, along with having no actual laws pertaining to the matter of mentally ill committing violent crime), as evidenced in the aforementioned cases, is seemingly either A) put them to death, or B) let them walk free.Apparently Hiroshi Mori was aware of B) and kept that in mind when writing Perfect Insider, with a healthy dose of Anime Logic™ to keep it firmly on the side of ""That\'s some crap"". Dr. Shiki Magata manages to not only get away with the double murder of her parents (be declared not competent to stand trial and \'released to the care of her family\' {as per Japanese law}), but then be allowed to walk free and live inside of a laboratory for 15 years. Never mind that this lab is not monitored by the police and government, a total lack of oversight over a dangerous, mentally ill AND unstable criminal, but that she\'s also able to open the door HERSELF and leave, were it to come to that.About 200 years ago, a guy named Ed Allan wrote a story about how to imprison someone you don\'t want leaving... it involved some bricks and a little bit of wine. Bottom line is, if they didn\'t want Shiki to escape, why the hell would they build a door to her ""cell"" that SHE can open? That\'s just plain stupid. You don\'t give prisoners a key to their cell when they go to jail.The next bit of ridiculous anime logic is how, once Dr. Magata escapes, she\'s instantaneously wanted by the police. Oh, now that she\'s not in her little laboratory that she ran herself, she\'s now wanted? What are they going to do when they arrest her this time? Slap on the wrist, walk free again? What purpose does this serve?There was a tiny scene showing her arraignment in court, and the apparent release implied thereafter. I don\'t know what\'s more insane, Japan\'s laws on mentally ill persons committing violent crimes like murder, or Dr. Magata.The detective characters also overlook so many obvious clues that I nearly smashed my frontal bone completely in two with my palm. They also take everything that the workers at the lab say at face value, including ridiculous absolutes like ""it\'s IMPOSSIBLE for anything to be wrong with the computer system"", or ""this door can NEVER be opened"", or ""NO ONE EVER has come or gone from here"", and others. There wouldn\'t be a mystery if these absolutes were true, so why they continue to stick to them and the protagonists believe them is beyond me.Characters: 4Onto our characters, Saikawa is one of the edgiest level 98 Glorious Edgemaster  of Balrons ever. He\'s edgier than stepping on a Lego, barefoot (which also feature prominently in this show- product placement, hah!). This guy is the ultimate form of cool. He\'s got the look- long shaggy mop hair that hangs over one eye like a 15 year old scene kid, the only thing that he\'s missing is the dyed edge of his hair and eye makeup, which he makes up for by having two black eyes because he\'s too edgy to sleep, because sleeping might take away time from his infinitely deep philosophical musings. He wears shirts with sarcastic phrases or esoteric images on them that only further deepen this mystique he\'s trying to build. Which really just means that he doesn\'t care about his appearance because such things are beneath him. Saikawa also smokes incessantly, because smoking just further increases your cool points.Saikawa exists in the show mostly to spout off pseudo intellectual BS that can be found any day of the week on the hot list of r/iam14andthisisdeep. In fact, this page was probably inspired by the original 1996 Perfect Insider novel. His musings include, but are not limited to: the meaning of life, the meaning of death, the meaning of love, and many other answerless questions. His powers include: a deep and unexplained understanding of programming languages, BS skills like no other, and being a tough guy who resists cute girls for no other reason than that he\'s just too far advanced in knowledge and understanding to be trifled with such foolish things.Nishinosono:She exists in the show to attempt to give a more human feel to the robotic Saikawa, and to have someone in the show that\'s stupid and doesn\'t get it, and so in having it explained to them, the audience also gets the developments going on in Saikawa\'s head. Other than that, Nishinosono\'s presence is to blush anytime someone mentions Saikawa\'s name, and generally fawn over him and how edgy he is.These characters in Perfect Insider are the dumbest smart people I\'ve ever seen. Mr. Mori seemingly was never told ""show, not tell""- which is rule #1 in characterization. I don\'t care how many times you beat me over the head with Nishinosono telling Saikawa how smart he is, or how observant or technologically proficient he is, or the same apparent attributes of Dr. Magata. I don\'t have any idea why Saikawa or Nishinosono are supposedly such brilliant people, as I\'ve no indication of their backgrounds or lives outside of what little we\'re shown in flashbacks. I know that Saikawa is an educated man because he\'s a professor of architecture, but that does not explain his seemingly boundless knowledge of the various technologies and workings of a so called ""genius""- Dr. Magata.For the icing on the stupid cake, the mystery is finally solved with a really bad deus ex machina, whereas the rest of the tale was unraveled using semi-to-realistic logic and things that can actually happen. Suffice to say that some characters get into some Tranquility Lane style virtual reality loungers and manage to find what they were looking for. A real cop out of a way to ""solve"" the mystery.Enjoyment and Overall: 4, 5It makes me sad to learn that Kenji Kawai did the soundtrack for this pile, because it was utterly forgettable. Honestly, this isn\'t the worst series of the season, but as far as being a mystery, it\'s far too reliant on conveniences and longshots in an shallow attempt at appearing deep. I had figured out about 80% of the mystery by the 5th or 6th episode, and it was all downhill from there, with a really forgettable cast of characters and a hokey ending. did my own research, which turned up some very strange findings.

He was sentenced to death in 2011, upheld in 2015.What Japan does (because of deep seated cultural norms and customs, along with having no actual laws pertaining to the matter of mentally ill committing violent crime), as evidenced in the aforementioned cases, is seemingly either A) put them to death, or B) let them walk free.Apparently Hiroshi Mori was aware of B) and kept that in mind when writing Perfect Insider, with a healthy dose of Anime Logic™ to keep it firmly on the side of ""That\'s some crap"". Dr. Shiki Magata manages to not only get away with the double murder of her parents (be declared not competent to stand trial and \'released to the care of her family\' {as per Japanese law}), but then be allowed to walk free and live inside of a laboratory for 15 years. Never mind that this lab is not monitored by the police and government, a total lack of oversight over a dangerous, mentally ill AND unstable criminal, but that she\'s also able to open the door HERSELF and leave, were it to come to that.About 200 years ago, a guy named Ed Allan wrote a story about how to imprison someone you don\'t want leaving... it involved some bricks and a little bit of wine. Bottom line is, if they didn\'t want Shiki to escape, why the hell would they build a door to her ""cell"" that SHE can open? That\'s just plain stupid. You don\'t give prisoners a key to their cell when they go to jail.The next bit of ridiculous anime logic is how, once Dr. Magata escapes, she\'s instantaneously wanted by the police. Oh, now that she\'s not in her little laboratory that she ran herself, she\'s now wanted? What are they going to do when they arrest her this time? Slap on the wrist, walk free again? What purpose does this serve?There was a tiny scene showing her arraignment in court, and the apparent release implied thereafter. I don\'t know what\'s more insane, Japan\'s laws on mentally ill persons committing violent crimes like murder, or Dr. Magata.The detective characters also overlook so many obvious clues that I nearly smashed my frontal bone completely in two with my palm. They also take everything that the workers at the lab say at face value, including ridiculous absolutes like ""it\'s IMPOSSIBLE for anything to be wrong with the computer system"", or ""this door can NEVER be opened"", or ""NO ONE EVER has come or gone from here"", and others. There wouldn\'t be a mystery if these absolutes were true, so why they continue to stick to them and the protagonists believe them is beyond me.Characters: 4Onto our characters, Saikawa is one of the edgiest level 98 Glorious Edgemaster  of Balrons ever. He\'s edgier than stepping on a Lego, barefoot (which also feature prominently in this show- product placement, hah!). This guy is the ultimate form of cool. He\'s got the look- long shaggy mop hair that hangs over one eye like a 15 year old scene kid, the only thing that he\'s missing is the dyed edge of his hair and eye makeup, which he makes up for by having two black eyes because he\'s too edgy to sleep, because sleeping might take away time from his infinitely deep philosophical musings. He wears shirts with sarcastic phrases or esoteric images on them that only further deepen this mystique he\'s trying to build. Which really just means that he doesn\'t care about his appearance because such things are beneath him. Saikawa also smokes incessantly, because smoking just further increases your cool points.Saikawa exists in the show mostly to spout off pseudo intellectual BS that can be found any day of the week on the hot list of r/iam14andthisisdeep. In fact, this page was probably inspired by the original 1996 Perfect Insider novel. His musings include, but are not limited to: the meaning of life, the meaning of death, the meaning of love, and many other answerless questions. His powers include: a deep and unexplained understanding of programming languages, BS skills like no other, and being a tough guy who resists cute girls for no other reason than that he\'s just too far advanced in knowledge and understanding to be trifled with such foolish things.Nishinosono:She exists in the show to attempt to give a more human feel to the robotic Saikawa, and to have someone in the show that\'s stupid and doesn\'t get it, and so in having it explained to them, the audience also gets the developments going on in Saikawa\'s head. Other than that, Nishinosono\'s presence is to blush anytime someone mentions Saikawa\'s name, and generally fawn over him and how edgy he is.These characters in Perfect Insider are the dumbest smart people I\'ve ever seen. Mr. Mori seemingly was never told ""show, not tell""- which is rule #1 in characterization. I don\'t care how many times you beat me over the head with Nishinosono telling Saikawa how smart he is, or how observant or technologically proficient he is, or the same apparent attributes of Dr. Magata. I don\'t have any idea why Saikawa or Nishinosono are supposedly such brilliant people, as I\'ve no indication of their backgrounds or lives outside of what little we\'re shown in flashbacks. I know that Saikawa is an educated man because he\'s a professor of architecture, but that does not explain his seemingly boundless knowledge of the various technologies and workings of a so called ""genius""- Dr. Magata.For the icing on the stupid cake, the mystery is finally solved with a really bad deus ex machina, whereas the rest of the tale was unraveled using semi-to-realistic logic and things that can actually happen. Suffice to say that some characters get into some Tranquility Lane style virtual reality loungers and manage to find what they were looking for. A real cop out of a way to ""solve"" the mystery.Enjoyment and Overall: 4, 5It makes me sad to learn that Kenji Kawai did the soundtrack for this pile, because it was utterly forgettable. Honestly, this isn\'t the worst series of the season, but as far as being a mystery, it\'s far too reliant on conveniences and longshots in an shallow attempt at appearing deep. I had figured out about 80% of the mystery by the 5th or 6th episode, and it was all downhill from there, with a really forgettable cast of characters and a hokey ending.', 'The Perfect Insider is a great example of how fast an interesting premise can turn into a bad story. If you came to this anime looking for an interesting and intellectual show, then I would advise you to look somewhere else.STORYThis show started out with an interesting premise. The premise being that a genius programmer Shiki Magata is murdered within a locked room on an isolated island. This becomes a game of cat and mouse, as our two main characters (or protagonists) search around for clues to the mystery. While I hyped the premise initially, the actual progression/execution of the show was lackluster to...say the least. The answer to the mystery was rather predictable, but I was hoping that the execution would be better. The themes were simply not explored enough and most of dialogue seem unneeded or unnatural. In fact most of the show consists of poorly written dialogue, with very slow pacing and annoying plot holes/plot conveniences. This show tries to bombard you with pseudo-intellectualism, rather than actual facts, logic or interesting logistical questions.Even when a noteworthy question is asked, it is quickly overshadowed by other non-sense within the show. In some cases, the question is not even related to the problem at hand. In other situations, the answers are very left field or do not even answer the question. However, the final episode was very well written. Unlike previous episodes many interesting questions were proposed and answered. We gain a bit more understanding of Shiki Magata; however, one episode does not make up for the entirety of the show. The plot just contains a lot of lazy writing, pseudo-intellectualism and moments of huge info dumping.""Every human starts as a genius. And as they age, they become average.""- Shiki MagataCHARACTERSAll of the characters are surprisingly flat, which is shocking coming from a dialogue heavy show. Many of their motivations, fears, or dreams are stripped away. We are left with dull 2-dimensional characters, with no additional interesting information or talents about them. There are three main characters:Souhei Saikawa:Angsty, pseudo-intellectual main character, who solves the mystery with almost little to no insight. Most of his rants have nothing to do with the actual plot, and his moments of “genius” are ass-pulls.Shiki Magata:Genius, yet psychotic programmer, with the foresight of a time wizard. There’s almost no motivation for this character and no personality either. She’s merely a plot device, nothing more or less.Moe Nishinosono:Young side kick who obsesses over Souhei. She’s just a hollow placeholder for the audience to project their views and feelings through, while they watch the show.ART/ANIMATIONThe art is typical, nothing new in this department; however, the animation can be a bit sloppy at some points. For anime built around dialogue, many of the scenes were often animated badly. There were many jump cuts and some seriously awkward camera angles.SOUND/OSTThis is where Subete redeems itself. The OST was rather fitting for the type of narrative created. It added to the atmosphere and overall progression of the show. The opening and ending songs were very well done. The opening was very catchy. The ending song keeps and maintains this upbeat feeling, unlike most ending songs of today. The voice acting was spot on, I have no complaint in this section.OVERALLThe Perfect Insider is a mediocre at best. No matter how interesting a premise is, if the execution and characters cannot match, then the show simply fails. Subete unfortunately bit off more than it could chew, which caused it to resort to pseudo-intellectualism blurs rather than creating logic/interesting dialogue and characters. I would say to try another show before you watch Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider.FINAL GRADED say the least.

As such, it\'s time for my first non-seasonal review in like half a year.What are the key components of a good murder mystery? First, and quite obviously, is the mystery itself. The mystery has to be clever, in such a way that the solution is unexpected, yet logical. The viewer also has to have adequate engagement with the story and be able to figure out the mystery for himself. Secondly, and also quite obviously, there is the investigation. The detective looks for...clues, talks to witnesses, and pieces together the final picture, all while providing the same information to the viewer. And lastly, there has to be suspense. The viewer has to be invested in the story. If there is no suspense, the viewer simply doesn\'t give a shit and the solution to the mystery falls completely flat. Common sense, right?Well, The Perfect Insider (right up there with KADO: The Right Answer for most cringy/edgy anime title) has none of those elements.The mystery itself is pathetic, and literally anybody should be able to figure it out in the first five episodes of the show. As I want to spoil as little as possible, I can\'t really explain why, but I\'ll try anyway. The key to the mystery is given to you nearly instantly. When the corpse first rolls out (literally, it rolls out), there is an immediately noticeable age difference between the corpse and the supposed victim. The corpse looks about 14 years old, but the supposed victim is around 30. Hm, I wonder what could possibly explain that! I\'ve got no clue! (By the way, the show explains this away as ""she doesn\'t age"". Uh, what?) Secondly, the door to the room the corpse rolls out from hasn\'t been opened in like 15 years or something, so the supposed victim, the *woman* inside, is the only possible victim! But who could\'ve killed her! Hmmmmmmm. Take a moment and try to piece the two strings of information together. Besides suicide, how could a woman be murdered in a room that has undoubtedly not been entered by anyone in 15 years, and why would the corpse look like a 15-year-old instead of a 30-year-old? Gee, I just have no clue.Moving on to the second aspect: The Perfect Insider must be the first murder mystery ever where the characters legitimately do not investigate (besides for like one episode of them walking around the victim\'s room and looking at her PC). Although this is reasonable, considering how absurdly simple the mystery is, it doesn\'t make for good entertainment. The entirety of the show is dialogue, and most of the dialogue is infodumps. For like eight episodes, the two main characters just talk to each other until one of them goes ""haha! I\'ve figured it out!"", and that\'s it.And, if it\'s not yet obvious, there\'s no suspense. My experience of watching The Perfect Insider went something like this:Episodes 1-3: ""why the fuck are they talking for 3/11 episodes of a murder mystery before the murder ever happens?""End of episode 3: ""ah looks like the murder finally happened. why is the corpse limbless, wearing a wedding dress, and rolling out on a sci-fi robot trolley? did sakae esuno write this?""Episodes 4-11: ""zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz""Like, the show somehow managed to get more boring AFTER the murder occurred. That\'s really impressive tbh. I guess the only thing more boring than the buildup to a murder mystery is a murder mystery that you\'ve already solved.Another important aspect that needs to be noted is the sheer amount of edge. (Just as a reference, since ""edgy"" constantly gets thrown around as a meaningless criticism, my definition is ""excessively dark to the point of being comical or difficult to take seriously""). Now, I\'m usually a fan of edgy shows. I enjoyed Mirai Nikki, Akame ga Kill, and even Arifureta a fair amount. But holy shit this is just too much. Here are just a few of the hyper-edgy aspects of the show:1. The state of the corpse as previously mentioned2. The supposed victim stabbed her parents to death for virtually no reason when she was 15. The show and the main character, by the way, treat this as a normal thing, because ""it\'s natural for a child to want to kill their parents"" or some retarded shit like that.3. One of the characters has an extremely fucked up, incestuous relationship4. Not a single character cares about the murders, or that they are trapped with a murderer in a facility that you can\'t enter or exit. They just treat it as an everyday occurrence and move on with their lives.5. The whole conclusion to the show (about the last four episodes or so) is asininely edgy, to the point that it\'s unbelievable. As I\'m trying to keep this review spoiler-free, I\'d refer you to the second-to-last paragraph of Flawfinder\'s review (4th top one), if you want to spoil yourself.As for characters, the 2/10 rating of ""dreadful"" is quite accurate. Besides the three main characters, no other characters exist in the show. The most favorited side character has 7 favorites, and he has about four minutes of screentime before never again appearing in the show.Main character 1: Psycho Bitch. She mainly appears in flashbacks, and she\'s really smart. She\'s also insane, as she killed her parents. That\'s literally it.Main character 2: Emo Genius. This guy, just like main character 3, isn\'t a character. He is a plot device. He is the detective in the case, and that\'s it. He also often says depressed, pseudo-philosophical things that pretend to be deep. My favorite one of these is as follows:""Whenever I get up in the morning, I always think to myself, \'Am I really the same person I was yesterday?\' For example, just as a computer loads its OS into memory and boots up each time it restarts, is it possible I\'m just booting up the person called \'Saikawa Souhei\' each morning and trying to play that role?""What the fuck does that mean? Nothing. It means nothing. It\'s pretentious, faux-intellectual garbage masquerading as philosophy.Main character 3: Horny Sounding Board. My favorite one of the three, as she is neither obnoxious nor insane. She exists so that Emo Genius has someone to tell his bullshit and expository dialogue to. She also wants to fuck him.Sound: Why is every show with a KANA-BOON opening always shit? Seriously, why is one of the best Japanese bands relegated to dogshit like this, Sarazanmai, and Boruto? The OST is pretty good tbh. I\'d have given the sound an 8 if not for a ten-minute-long conversation that was entirely in Engrish. Literal ear rape.Art: The best part of this is that the original character designs are done by Asano Inio, the king of faux-intellectualism. That\'s just incredibly ironic. Other than that, the art is ok. This being a 2015 A-1 Pictures show pretty much says everything.In conclusion, this is by far the worst mystery I\'ve encountered not only in anime but in any type of literature whatsoever. It would perhaps be passable as a novel, but it fails as a work of an audiovisual medium. The whole show consists of infodumps, the mystery is easily solvable, and not even the characters give a shit about the case. clues, talks to witnesses, and pieces together the final picture, all while providing the same information to the viewer.

The two then work together to solve the mysteries of what becomes a serial murder case.I don\'t normally write reviews, but I had to make an exception for this show since I\'m not too sure that many people are quite getting its meaning. For people who are currently on the fence trying to decide whether or not to watch Perfect...Insider, please do not take the current aggregate score on MyAnimeList as an indicative measurement of the overall quality. The anime is simply different, not bad; and, to be quite frank, it takes an open mind and different kind of thinking towards plot progression to appreciate what is being done here.The first and foremost aspect of the plot that must be addressed is that it does NOT primarily belong to the mystery genre. I can not stress this enough. If you start watching this anime thinking that it will have a conventional mystery plotline, such as Sherlock Holmes, then you will be severely disappointed by the outcome. For instance, the ""mystery"" aspect of the anime doesn\'t actually begin until the very end of episode 2 going into episode 3. Furthermore, the progression (i.e. the deductive and inductive analysis) is very slow and does not build up to ""edge-of-your-seat"" climatic moments. Quite simply, you won\'t find a clever detective snooping around with a magnifying glass and quirky methodologies to solve the mystery. What you get, instead, is Sohei Saikawa and a lot of philosophical dialogue; and this is the main point that I wanted to get to.Perfect Insider is more of a kind of documentary than anything else. It ""documents"" the character\'s and their personalities to make a commentary on the human condition. The mystery aspect is, quite honestly, a side-note that adds a little bit of spunk to the overall narrative. However, it is still completely necessary as the mystery genre, in general, offers some of the best opportunities for internal reflection and inquiry. The exception in Perfect Insider is that, instead of asking solely HOW the killer committed the crime, a good portion of time is spend also asking WHY the killer committed the crime; and this all ties in with the philosophical dialogues that are persistent throughout the anime.So, what type of viewer would enjoy this show? An intellectual. And by intellectual, I do not mean someone who is ""smart"" or ""intelligent."" I mean someone who likes to inquire about nature and ponder the meaning that their life holds. There is a particular quote by Saikawa in episode 1 that stuck out to me, and it is something like this: Whenever I get up in the morning, I always think to myself, ""Am I really the same person I was yesterday""? If you\'re someone that truly thinks about questions like these, then the meaning of Perfect Insider may make a lot more sense to you than the average person.Overall, I can not say that Perfect Insider is perfect in itself. It could focus a bit more on the plot progression and character development, of which there exists none, in my opinion. I do not wish to get into a generic review discussing the music and animation, as both are of average to good quality, so there isn\'t really anything left to discuss. In addition, the score that I provide for this anime is not indicative of my overall impression; it is just something that is, of course, required.  One last thing that I do want to mention is that this anime is based off of a novel of a similar name, and, as a result, it holds a particular degree of ""unity.""In other words, the ending ties in and complements the beginning, and vice versa. So, remember this if you become confused by some of the scenes.In conclusion, I think that Perfect Insider is a great anime with a good story and interesting character personalities. Please do not simply let the opinions of others, including myself, carry the significant weight in your overall decision-making. After all, we are all free to make our own choices as long as we first define ""ourselves.""

After all, we are all free to make our own choices as long as we first define ""ourselves.""', 'The Perfect Insider is a mystery anime that came out in October 2015 and is an adaptation of a light novel by the same name, which was released in 1996. That should be enough to set expectations really low, and that is really the only way to enjoy this show. Either that or you only care about visuals, superficial characters and ignore plot holes.So I\'ll start by saying what\'s good about this show. It was animated by A-1 Pictures, the same studio that adapted Sword Art Online, Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso and Fairy Tail...(2009-2013), among others, into an anime. If you have watched any of the previously mentioned shows, you will know that A-1 Pictures makes some of the best lookin visuals and animation out there. The Perfect Insider is not an exception. The color palette used is bright and colorful, the backgrounds are beautiful, character figures move in a very fluid way, face expressions are detailed and there are no significant quality drops. Audio wise, the sound effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack, although forgettable, fits the show\'s ambience.And so looking pretty is all that this show does well, and since every anime nowdays looks pretty, this isn\'t much to write home about. It does nothing to distinguish itself from every other mystery story out there.And speaking of mystery, the whole purpose of having one in a story is to serve as a hook to keep people interested. It is a very good way to gradually reveal things about the world, plot or characters if they are not meant to be explained all at once. But it should never overshadow said world, plot or characters, and the Perfect Insider does exactly that. Everyone except the main characters are simply there to make the plot move forward. They get no characterization, no development, and feel very one dimensional. Some are not even given a name!The main characters are not much better too. One of the protagonists is the typical ""genius that hates the world he lives in"" edgelord stereotype, randomly spewing out filosophical thoughts that sometimes don\'t even have anything to do with the story at all, in a poor attempt at making the show look ""deep"" and ""a commentary on the human condition"". The only thing that defines him is his love for cigarettes. The other protagonist is a girl that is in love with edgelord 420 (for no apparent reason), and is just as boring and bland as him.The main villain is easily the most interesting character in the whole show, because unlike others she has motives and objectives, and is given a backstory and reasons to act like she does. Still, she is above average at best, since she also suffers from many of the same problems the other two main characters do.Back to the mystery aspect, for a mystery to be done well, it needs to foreshadow future evens by giving hints and clues. The idea is that the viewer should have enough information to predict said future events. For example, in Death Note, the author makes sure to let us know everything we need to know to make the mind games feel plausible. Things like Light getting out of a difficult situation because he knew one crucial detail that was never hinted at before about the rules of the death note doesn\'t happen. The Perfect Insider does the exact opposite. To exemplify, there is a scene where the protagonist looks at a bookshelf (never shown before, by the way) and notices an important detail, a pattern in the books\' volume numbers. There was no way anyone could have seen that coming, since this was never hinted at, thus making it a half-assed, poorly written way to make the story continue to unfold.The mystery finally comes to an end when the main character has an epiphany and suddenly figures everything out, out of nowhere. Again, impossible for anyone to have thought of what he did.To sum up, forgettable cardboard characters, plot that barely makes sense, slow pacing, pretentious and sometimes unnecessary filosophical reflections, poorly executed mystery, but beautiful visuals, very good animation and decent sound. The Perfect Insider is boring, forgettable, and badly written. (2009-2013), among others, into an anime.

This would be my first one, so I hope you guys bare with it.I\'ll explain my plight with a humorous short story - trust me, it\'s much more interesting that this anime:==In an art competition, an artist stands in front of his painting, and the judges walk up to him and ask him to explain the concept before opening and revealing the painting on canvas. The artist says that he has drawn the situation where: ""Buddha lets fly a...white dove to symbolize peace and walks away. Unfortunately, a hunter who was hidden shoots this dove. The dove falls to the ground and dies.""The judges were mesmerized with the concept and were yearning to see the painting. The artist reveals the canvas and it\'s absolutely white and plain. They ask him:Where is Buddha? - I told you that he let the dove fly and left!Where is the hunter? - I told you that he was hidden!Where is the dove? - I told you that it fell to the ground and died!I think this anime is much like that. There is quite frankly a stupid hype around an absolutely plain and bland anime. If you are capable of just looking at a white canvas and imagining a concept as deep as above, maybe you\'ll enjoy this one. For mere mortals like myself, this anime is mediocre at best, and absolute shit if you are in a bad mood.===== My thoughts (mild spoilers) ====-- I think the Perfect Insider is at best a mediocre series, and your disappointment with it will likely increase the more you think about it.-- I feel that the author got hold of one idea: a person is locked in a room for 15 years with minimal observation inside the cell; this person must have a child inside which no one knows about; and a glorious plan is set into motion which lasts the entire 15 years.-- In order to make this implausible and frankly ridiculous idea a reality, the creators perform one ass-pull after the other. In order to disguise these ass-pulls, they pepper it up with copious amount of philosophical rants, which after a point becomes absolutely silly.-- There are some scenes, dialogues, and actions which wanted to portray a high-brow attitude and show that some of these characters are really smart. These absolutely bombed. I am working towards a PhD in Math/CS at a top university, and I haven\'t come across a single professor or student who acts this way. Some of the CS ideas are plain wrong too.-- Character motivations are not explained at all. Things happen a particular way because the author wanted it to happen that way. The events don\'t seem to evolve organically and feel almost forced. There are no reasons given for *why* a character does something other than the fact that doing so furthers a plot. There appear to be numerous alternative actions some characters could have done (including Dr. Shiki) which would have been quicker, neater, and led to the same final conclusion. People claimed to be as smart as these characters would certainly see such alternatives. white dove to symbolize peace and walks away. Unfortunately, a hunter who was hidden shoots this dove.

It looks good, seems interesting & at first you\'re totally along for the ride. Then, at some point, you start noticing that nothing makes sense & the more information it gives you, more questions you have.Fall 2015 started out looking like such a strong season for detective dramas. Alongside the Return of Kindaichi Case Files, there were two new titles that looked set to fill a void for non-fantasy murder mysteries, with Beautiful Bones: Sakurako\'s Investigation & Everything Becomes F: The Perfect Insider (EBF) adding some new blood into a...genre that has relatively slim pickings for animé fans.1. StoryAt first, EBF seemed likely to be the best of all three. While Kindaichi began with what was the weakest case file of the series thus far, & Beautiful Bones seemed more interested in being Pet Pathologist of Sakurako than solving crimes, EBF\'s first few episodes provided a slow build up to its murder mystery, with a noticeably different art style, much darker tone & a more complex & intriguing story with a greater focus on the thoughts & philosophies of the main characters than in the other shows. While certainly slow, these early episodes laid a pretty solid looking foundation for a darker, smarter story than one can usually expect from TV animéEBF\'s story unfolds through three plot lines that take place at different times & from the perspective of different characters. In the main story, Moe Nishinosono & her teacher/guardian/crush Souhei Saikawa all but blag their way into an island facility that houses Shiki Magata, the infamous as she is mysterious woman who murdered her parents fifteen years ago & has since lived in total isolation underground. No sooner do they manage this, then they find themselves caught up in a gruesome & seemingly impossible double murder. Concurrent to this, there are flashbacks to a previous interview between Moe & Shiki, in which Shiki takes a strange interest in Moe\'s past; & each episode also ends with another flashback, apparently from the perspective of Shiki\'s uncle writing his memories of a very dark & twisted relationship between Shiki & himself.For the first few episodes of EBF, its slow pacing teeters on but doesn\'t completely cross the line between methodical & boring. EBF is a very dialogue driven series, & a large portion of the runtime is taken up by two characters talking about the mystery, which is even more impenetrable to them than the audience because they lack the benefit of those flashbacks giving context to Shiki\'s past & thus why she might have ended up how she did. While quite dry & dense, not to mention some laughably clunky lines like ""red...red is a colour"" the plot slowly builds momentum towards solving the cryptic riddle, apparently left by the killer, of what everything becomes F means, & thus the who, how & why of this seemingly impossible closed room murder mystery (incidentally, what\'s with animé & having characters use that literary term to refer to cases? Is it meant to be meta?)However, for all the potential of EBF, it ultimately falls apart once the characters & setting have been established. The deliberately slow pacing of the show increasingly seems less about methodically building up to a resolution than it is padding out an overly long runtime. The conversations between Moe & Souhei, which can be hard enough to sit through to begin with, start repeating themselves as they pretty much have nothing to do between episode six, when they first solve the meaning of F, & episode 10 when the plot finally decides it\'s time to close the case. Indeed, in what I can only assume was a rather glaring error that slipped through the script drafting process, they forget that they\'ve solved the meaning of F (one meaning, anyway) so they can have another overly long exchange on what it might mean. This dialogue problem reaches it\'s most excruciating during an exchange between Souhei & a woman who\'s supposedly Shiki\'s sister which lasts ten minutes, is entirely in English & the VA\'s are clearly exerting all their effort into just getting the words right.2. CharactersIt doesn\'t help that EBF\'s characters are, frankly, not able to carry such a slow story. Moe, can seem at times like she stumbled out of a high school animé. Her character is meant to act as the emotional counterbalance to Souhei\'s cold rationalism, even though she is a maths genius which would suggest a character more suited to cool logic. Unfortunately, she mostly expresses this side of her by being petulant & sulky, especially when Souhei doesn\'t notice her. She seems to get jealous whenever other women talk to or even about him, & quickly seems to start measuring herself against Shiki when she sees the interest Souhei has in trying to figure out her strange ways. The plot has an habit of taking a break from solving the mystery to focus on Moe & Souhei\'s relationship, which is annoying at best - not least because the author has all but said he added a slow burning relationship between the two just to keep people reading his books (of which EBF is the first of nine volumes & various short stories).Souhei himself is the aloof, introverted type who speaks in monologues even when talking to other people.  VA Yasuyuki Kase also gives to Souhei a low, monotone voice that is suitable to the character, but means that a large portion of every episode is listening to his monotonous monologues. That Souhei is a self-important, get on my level type of character just makes it worse to listen to.His interest in the mystery seems purely intellectual. Indeed, it\'s arguably a flaw of the show that there is actually no reason for Souhei & Moe to be there or be allowed to investigate. They first go to the facility because Moe claims to have an interview with Shiki, but that\'s soon revealed to be a lie, merely a devise to get them on the island (not the last time the story will rely on such a convenient contrivance to keep moving). Once the corpses appear, it\'s like they\'re solving the case just out of intellectual curiosity, which is fine & all but it doesn\'t explain why the staff are so cooperative, nor does it make for a compelling murder mystery in which he seems increasingly less interested in solving the mystery than in waxing lyrically about the philosophy that\'s apparently behind Shiki\'s & his own character.Shiki is a difficult character to talk about in a spoiler free manner, given that everything in EBF revolves around her. She has a detached, otherworldly manner to her that is not entirely unlike the aloofness of Souhei, but whereas he generally comes across as a bit self-loathing because he too normal for his liking, Shiki does operate in a completely different way to “regular” people. From the way she interacts with people in the flashbacks to the clues found by Moe & Souhei during their investigation, she comes across not unlike Hannibal Lecter, someone as fascinating as they are impenetrable.That impenetrableness, however, is also one of her flaws. Shiki is a character you want to understand, to decipher, but it\'s not possible to do so because, while I won\'t go into specifics, the reason for her being the enigma she is is ultimately that she was just born that way. That might not be an issue for some viewers, but for me personally saying a character was just born that way is like ending a story with it was all just a dream; even if the author intended it to be that way, it still feels like a cop out. This might be more of a problem in EBF\'s case because whereas Lecter\'s character is there to serve as a window into the mind of a different serial killer, Shiki is front & centre the focus of the story.Quite what her world view is also comes across in a rather jumbled manner. Themes of antinatalism, the nature of self & existentialism, nihilism & any other school of philosophy you fancy bringing up can be found somewhere, & it\'s clear some viewers have got a lot out of identifying & reading up on these. But be that as it may, Shiki herself is a character that makes less sense the more you\'re told about her, as do her motivations & actions. Souhei towards the end seems to view her as some sort of perfect human, but why that is seems to boil down to that she seems as complex as he wishes he was.If this seems like too much focus to be putting on the main characters, it\'s simply because there is almost nothing worth saying about any of the support. The university students that accompany Souhei & Moe are really only there so Moe can talk to someone other than Souhei about the case in one episode. Likewise the staff at the facility just seem to wait around to be interviewed or push the plot button on a relevant keyboard. Shiki\'s uncle, who is nominally one of the characters whose point of view we\'re supposed to be viewing part of the story from, is completely eclipsed by his nieces presence & doesn\'t really have anything to him worth mentioning. Indeed, if EBF had just been Moe, Souhei & Shiki in a room together, it wouldn\'t have changed much.3. ProductionOn the production side of things, there are some rather odd directorial decisions that have been made during EBF. A couple of scenes, most notably the final one, seem to cut off abruptly & awkwardly. One scene where Souhei is talking to an employee of the facility has what looks like a rather amusing continuity error, where Souhei is meant to be cooking breakfast but whenever it cuts from showing the food to him talking, he\'s standing in the office with his hand apparently holding an invisible pan. Perhaps finally realising that watching two people sitting down, talking in shot, reverse-shot is rather boring, towards the end there are a couple of dialogue scenes where the location repeatedly changes during unbroken conversation; which is disorientating as much as it is attention keeping.That\'s not to say EBF looks bad, by any means. Indeed it is a visually enjoyable experience, which is fortunate given how little movement or action occurs. The colour is sufficiently desaturated to suit the tone of the story, & the character designs are likewise realistic enough to not feel out of place as more stylised face designs would have. But, if I\'m being honest, this is like complimenting a grey blur for picking the right shade of grey. The OP & ED are both enjoyable, with the OP being a rather fun to interpret dance routine between stencil outlines of Souhei, Moe & Shiki. So that\'s three minutes of this nearly four hour show worth watching, at least. There is a rather contrived reason to get Moe into a two piece swimsuit in one episode, but other than that the director resists the temptation to add the usual anime visual clichés.This review has been harsher on EBF than it perhaps was intended to be, but then again it\'s the type of show that the more I think about it, the less it holds up. That the main characters are rather flawed could have made them interesting, but they\'re so boring & full of themselves that it it doesn\'t take long to be sick of seeing them. You only have to look at the Sodachi arc of Owarimonogatari, which aired at the same time, to see how a dialogue driven dark mystery anime can be done better.There are some clever sounding twists that initially make you think ""oooh that\'s interesting"" till you pause to think about how they just complicate & confuse an already difficult to comprehend story. In fact clever sounding twists that complicate everything pretty much sums up EBF, especially with regards to Shiki. It\'s a real shame that it is this way, because buried in there, somewhere, was a murder mystery I really wanted to like. Indeed, if I were to rewatch the series again, knowing what depths it sinks to, I\'d probably have an even more negative opinion of it.Maybe it\'s because they\'re only adapting the first in a series of novels, which means nothing is really concluded & indeed gives the whole series the sense of just being the first act or prologue to a bigger story. Indeed, in a perfect world I\'d like to imagine they would have adapted the entire series, making each one a feature length episode in the way ITV did their best detective dramas in the 90s & early 2000\'s. But whatever EBF could have been, it\'s hard to recommend what it is. genre that has relatively slim pickings for animé fans.1. StoryAt first, EBF seemed likely to be the best of all three.

Souhei towards the end seems to view her as some sort of perfect human, but why that is seems to boil down to that she seems as complex as he wishes he was.If this seems like too much focus to be putting on the main characters, it\'s simply because there is almost nothing worth saying about any of the support. The university students that accompany Souhei & Moe are really only there so Moe can talk to someone other than Souhei about the case in one episode. Likewise the staff at the facility just seem to wait around to be interviewed or push the plot button on a relevant keyboard. Shiki\'s uncle, who is nominally one of the characters whose point of view we\'re supposed to be viewing part of the story from, is completely eclipsed by his nieces presence & doesn\'t really have anything to him worth mentioning. Indeed, if EBF had just been Moe, Souhei & Shiki in a room together, it wouldn\'t have changed much.3. ProductionOn the production side of things, there are some rather odd directorial decisions that have been made during EBF. A couple of scenes, most notably the final one, seem to cut off abruptly & awkwardly. One scene where Souhei is talking to an employee of the facility has what looks like a rather amusing continuity error, where Souhei is meant to be cooking breakfast but whenever it cuts from showing the food to him talking, he\'s standing in the office with his hand apparently holding an invisible pan. Perhaps finally realising that watching two people sitting down, talking in shot, reverse-shot is rather boring, towards the end there are a couple of dialogue scenes where the location repeatedly changes during unbroken conversation; which is disorientating as much as it is attention keeping.That\'s not to say EBF looks bad, by any means. Indeed it is a visually enjoyable experience, which is fortunate given how little movement or action occurs. The colour is sufficiently desaturated to suit the tone of the story, & the character designs are likewise realistic enough to not feel out of place as more stylised face designs would have. But, if I\'m being honest, this is like complimenting a grey blur for picking the right shade of grey. The OP & ED are both enjoyable, with the OP being a rather fun to interpret dance routine between stencil outlines of Souhei, Moe & Shiki. So that\'s three minutes of this nearly four hour show worth watching, at least. There is a rather contrived reason to get Moe into a two piece swimsuit in one episode, but other than that the director resists the temptation to add the usual anime visual clichés.This review has been harsher on EBF than it perhaps was intended to be, but then again it\'s the type of show that the more I think about it, the less it holds up. That the main characters are rather flawed could have made them interesting, but they\'re so boring & full of themselves that it it doesn\'t take long to be sick of seeing them. You only have to look at the Sodachi arc of Owarimonogatari, which aired at the same time, to see how a dialogue driven dark mystery anime can be done better.There are some clever sounding twists that initially make you think ""oooh that\'s interesting"" till you pause to think about how they just complicate & confuse an already difficult to comprehend story. In fact clever sounding twists that complicate everything pretty much sums up EBF, especially with regards to Shiki. It\'s a real shame that it is this way, because buried in there, somewhere, was a murder mystery I really wanted to like. Indeed, if I were to rewatch the series again, knowing what depths it sinks to, I\'d probably have an even more negative opinion of it.Maybe it\'s because they\'re only adapting the first in a series of novels, which means nothing is really concluded & indeed gives the whole series the sense of just being the first act or prologue to a bigger story. Indeed, in a perfect world I\'d like to imagine they would have adapted the entire series, making each one a feature length episode in the way ITV did their best detective dramas in the 90s & early 2000\'s. But whatever EBF could have been, it\'s hard to recommend what it is.', ""STORY: 7/10To be honest I started watching this anime because is a mystery and I'm a sucker for those. At the very beginning the mystery seems pretty interesting and each chapter you have different clues so you can make your own theory along with the characters. The main problem for me was that the plot has giant holes that do not explain the whole thing. There are some questions that are pretty obvious and there's no answer for any of them so you're left with the assumption that every single person in that laboratory are idiots for it to make sense.ART: 7/10The drawing style...of the characters was pretty plain. The animation is not that bad but it has nothing remarkable about it.SOUND: 8/10I loved the ending and the opening. The rest of the soundtrack is quite fine.CHARACTER: 7/10I'm assuming that since this anime is based on a novel, the book will give more insight about the characters. As with the plot there are many things left unanswered and you kind of want to know more about the characters and understand them better.In my opinion the only character fully developed is Shiki Magata and if it wasn't for her this series wouldn't be worth the time.ENJOYMENT: 7/10It is quite entertaining and interesting, but if you have seen more mysteries there some situations that are gonna make you feel disappointed.OVERALL: 7/10It is a nice series if you do not know what to watch, but as a mystery is quite poor and disappointing. The only worthwhile thing about it is the character of Shiki Magata. of the characters was pretty plain.

I see this series as more of an romantic anime than mystery/thriller anime :3- For me I liked the pace of the story, yes it is slow but only for developing the main characters, so I think that it was quite fitting.All the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons- The mystery was itself good but it could have been better and the anime could have paced a little bit quicker with the mystery plot.- For me the soundtrack was just average, nothing to complain nor embrace.- The conversations between the characters are very ""smart""/philosophical which is understandable not for everyone´s taste and you really need to pay attention for all the small hints hidden in the conversations.So yeah if you want to see a really good mystery detective series then this anime might not be for you, you really have to love the relationship and interaction between the two main characters because they are the factor which makes up the series. The mystery plot seems more like a catalyst for their relationship, the mystery plot isn´t the main focus I think ^^ good things- The art style for the 3 main characters was different and serious/realistic for the tone of the anime.- The opening was quite entertaining and artistic :)- The plot was average but the interaction between the 2-3 main characters made this anime great.

I normally don't watch a lot of mystery or thriller anime, but so far I've enjoyed The Perfect Insider more than I honestly thought I would. Obviously, the animation and character designs are nothing impressive, which is why I scored it so low in the art department, and Shikawa is really the only character I've found interesting and solid in his development; however, the opening and ending theme songs are great, and the soundtrack for the overall show has some pretty good, fitting tracks as well.Others have said the show moves fairly slow,...and in my opinion they're right. This doesn't detract from the show's pacing though; for The Perfect Insider, it works well, and I like how you're provided with information - both in the present and from the past - at varying intervals. Everything slowly falls into place, and it's certainly not chronological but I think it's more enjoyable to learn different things that are all over the place, and piece them together yourself as you follow the show and the character's own thoughts and insights. It's definitely a show you have to stick with; noticeably, those who gave the show lower ratings didn't watch that much of it, but if you're willing to endure slow pacing and average side characters that are somewhat lacking in the personality department, then you're honestly in for a treat plot-wise; Subeta ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider is a hidden gem of twists, revelations and a seemingly impossible mystery. and in my opinion they're right.

The story soon transformed from a murder mystery to a math/computer geek\'s wet dream come true. Even with all of that, given that...the pursuit of the truth was done with an emphasis on \'logic\' the final revelation was so far out there that you\'d need the Hubble telescope to find it.While the show is enjoyable in its build-up, the events immediately prior to the final revelation along with the revelation itself fail to keep the plot tight and focused. In the end, too much time is spent on abstract philosophy and less on the actual crimes committed. If the first few episodes were not thoroughly enjoyable for their MIND F**K moments, I wouldn\'t have enjoyed this show at all. the pursuit of the truth was done with an emphasis on \'logic\' the final revelation was so far out there that you\'d need the Hubble telescope to find it.While the show is enjoyable in its build-up, the events immediately prior to the final revelation along with the revelation itself fail to keep the plot tight and focused.

I\'m not going to argue against that, maybe there is some deeper truth that I missed, but I didn\'t enjoy it and my review will reflect that.First of all, the good: This show is visually appealing, especially the opening theme animation. I also found the animation pretty solid throughout and the sound never really distracted me from the story.The problems I\'ve had with the show was the story. The show does a good job of setting up the sense that...there\'s going to be a grand denouement where the truth is found out and the guilty part is pointed out, or that everything will come to be clear.To a certain extend this is accomplished. You know who did what at the end, but it felt unsatisfactory, probably because there was so much going on that I just started getting lost halfway through the story. There\'s a romance, child sexual abuse by a relative (though maybe not in the strictest legal sense in Japan, certainly for America/most countries since age of concent is different), a murder, a ghost in a computer, a doll that killed someone else years ago then ran away, multiple personalities, two sets of dead parents unrequited love, sisters showing up out of the blue and then going away only to reappear at a later time after which you find something you didn\'t know.The show suffered from the fact that too much was going on and you didn\'t get to see the character\'s motivations. You\'re also severely limited in the facts you are given and it\'s hardly fair to the viewer who wants to try and solve the murder along with the main character. Something that most mysteries do is to give you clues or hints along the way that you can reflect on later on and go ""Oooh, I should have SEEN that!"" and kick yourself. Sure they don\'t share the conclusions drawn by the detective, but you had at least some of the major building blocks and were there when the scene was set and you could figure it out.I didn\'t feel that in this show, though I might have missed it because I was too busy feeling too squeamish throughout most of the show to notice, but I felt like they kept more than the fair share of facts, important facts away from us, just to keep the suspense going. Characters who I feel should know more about things mysteriously don\'t because that would be inconvenient to the plot.Another thing that annoyed me was how they kept giving some philosophy lectures. ""What is the meaning to be human? What is murder? What is a person? What is love?"" To an extent this did help flavour the show, but it was just one more thing that was distracting from the main focus. I also didn\'t like a lot of the answers they came up with, which might explain my distaste for this show.The relationships and connections were rather vague until nearing the end because that would have possibly tipped us off to what was going on.In conclusion, I would say skip this anime unless you really like the mystery genre and philosophy. I felt awkward watching the scenes concerning underage sexual activity with a grown relative, the more ""traditional"" romances were weak and I didn\'t feel they did fair play with the mystery. The reasons why the main character decides to solve the mystery also are somewhat opaque as well. there\'s going to be a grand denouement where the truth is found out and the guilty part is pointed out, or that everything will come to be clear.To a certain extend this is accomplished.

If you\'re reading this, chances are you\'re interested in watching this show. This is one of the shows that are better as a binge watch than as a show that you pace yourself with or follow week per week. That\'s why you\'re lucky you get to watch this in one or two sittings! I was not so lucky and let me tell you why (just to brace yourself for what\'s in store for you).The main reason had to be the story\'s pacing. It\'s horrible. There are lots of arguments saying that this is the kind of show that doesn\'t...spoon-feed you the answers to the mystery and that it expects you or allows you to solve the mystery with them. So definitely expect to have more and more questions instead of answers at the end of each episode (yes, up until the last one, too!) It can be frustrating, but once the reveal is there, it makes you want to rewatch earlier episodes to see what you have missed or if they have been building up for it all along.Subete ga F ni Naru\'s 1-cour season can actually be summed up in around 4 episodes, I feel like. Just in case you\'re not familiar with the source material, our main characters, Moe and Saikawa are kind of a Sherlock & Watson pair who deal with strange cases. There\'s also a Japanese live-action dorama already out where it chronicles their adventures. In it, what they have gone through in 12 episodes in this show is told in 2 episodes tops. So that\'s not to say that there\'s more tighter and more concise way of telling it.There\'s really not too much action as most of the time is spent on discussions and dialogue. If that\'s your thing, then do check out this show! By any means, it\'s not a bad show per se. I find it hard-pressed to just write it off as bad, but it is indeed flawed. Without dragging this review on for too long, I do find its dialogue to be its best. We get to learn how the characters think, how they feel, and what they believe in without getting too on the nose. (Actual philosophy majors might actually be turned off from this though. The show can get pretentious at times and over-reaching to portray the characters as oh-so smart and deep.) However that alone couldn\'t save the whole storytelling of the series in my opinion. (If that\'s your thing then be my guest! Have at it!) There\'s only so much discussion and over-wrought ideas to be thrown around until it gets tedious and you\'re just left going ""Okay, we GET IT! So what now?""Overall, would I recommend this show to anyone? Perhaps not. It\'s a polarizing show and I find myself in the \'No thanks, skip this one!\' camp. Based on my experiences so far (after finishing the finale) I find myself telling my anime friends not to watch this show. But like I said, if you\'re into ""modern"" locked room mysteries with a dash of philosophical ideas on the side and wouldn\'t mind like 8 episodes of basically filler and talking, then you should give this a shot! spoon-feed you the answers to the mystery and that it expects you or allows you to solve the mystery with them.

If you\'re looking for a true mystery anime this is the one to try.Story: (9/10) The story was one of the things that impressed me the most about this anime. It starts out with Nishinosono Moe and her professor Saikawa Souhei who are both fans of the work of Dr. Magata Shiki, a scientist who has been living in complete isolation on an island for 15 years. Not only is she all alone but she ultimately hasn\'t left...her room let alone the laboratory she\'s been living in. Moe and Souhei decide that they want to go to meet Dr. Shiki in person but when they arrive they encounter more than one murder.At first when watching this show, I was actually pretty bored. You would think, ""Wow they walk into a murder scene, must be pretty intense!"" But the first few episodes are super talky, for lack of a better turn and I found myself fighting to keep my attention on it. I actually briefly considered dropping the show, but something told me I should stick it out, and boy am I glad I did.One of the best things about this show is its pacing. Of the mystery anime I\'ve seen, many of them take you on a wild goose chase of crazy outlandish mysteries that really don\'t even have anything to do with the main plot. Not Perfect Insider. Even though the show starts out slow the build up to the resolution of the mystery is handled excellently.  It reveals little pieces of information episode by episode and avoids the all too common flood of information squeezed into the last few episodes, which I absolutely loved. Other than the pacing the story itself is just darn good. Just when you think you know what\'s going on, it twists in ways that you weren\'t expecting. Once the ball gets rolling, Perfect Insider keeps the viewer on their toes and makes them think throughout the whole series. The only thing that keeps me from giving the story a 10/10 is the fact that it got a little confusing in parts and I wished for a little bit more explanation. But overall an excellent story.Art 9/10 The art and animation style in Perfect Insider was very unique! The character designs weren\'t you\'re typical kawaii, big eyed stereotypical anime characters. The people were designed more realistically than a lot that I\'ve seen. The colors in this show were sometimes a bit bland but it fit the overall serious tone of the show, so I don\'t feel that it took away from anything.Sound: 10/10 I\'m giving this a perfect 10 because I really liked the opening and ending songs, especially the opening. As far as the soundtrack, it really fit the serious and dark tone that was woven throughout the story.Characters: 8/10 The characters in Perfect Insider were fairly well developed. But I wished for a little more on the two lead characters that I just didn\'t get. I wanted to know more about what made them tick, how they got to where they were. That being said we do get a bit of background on them towards the end which is great. As far as how likable they are it\'s 50/50. I sometimes liked them and sometimes they got on my nerves. I guess it just depends on what they were doing at the time. The reason I gave this category an 8 instead of a bit lower though was because of one character and that was Dr. Magata Shiki. She is probably one of the most brilliant characters I\'ve seen written. You go into this series knowing that she\'s a genius but genius doesn\'t even being to cover it. I can\'t say much more than that without giving away major plot points, but you\'ll have to take my word on it. She\'s a well thought out character and the reason the plot is so great.Overall Enjoyment: 8/10 I\'ve pretty much covered in the other sections why I enjoyed this anime. I love something that keeps me guessing what\'s going to happen next. Not only guess but actually care about the ending. As also previously stated, the only reason that this isn\'t ranked a little higher is because this show could be really confusing at times especially if you aren\'t paying super close attention.Overall 7/10 Even though my individual category scores are higher, I still give Perfect Insider a 7. This is only simply because while every thing I said above is true, it\'s probably not a show that I would buy on DVD or watch again other than maybe to get some clarification. That being said, I believe that Perfect Insider is very impressive for its mystery genre which can sometimes fall flat.

The ending was not something that you figure out by EP 4 and then think that all the characters are stupid.Art (9/10): The art for the OP and ED was excellent but the character design, although really good, it wasn't to the same level as the OP and ED.Sound (9/10): The OP was incredible (one of my favorites) and the ED was great as well. The voice acting was also great.Character (7/10): I liked all of the characters but there wasn't anything too special...about them.Enjoyment (10/10): I loved the show a lot.Overall (10/10): This show is an excellent mystery anime with a great OP and ED and if you are thinking about watching it, I highly suggest doing so! about them.Enjoyment (10/10): I loved the show a lot.Overall (10/10): This show is an excellent mystery anime with a great OP and ED and if you are thinking about watching it, I highly suggest doing so!"", 'Spoilers etc.""The Perfect Insider"", or ""Everything becomes F*ck All"" is a mystery anime about a dysfunctional student-and-professor pairing trying to solve an elaborate locked-room murder mystery surrounding a schizophrenic genius the likes of which this world probably has never seen before(tm). The build-up and plot twists were interesting enough, character development was sort of there for the main duo and the show had plenty of clues and smokescreens to help keep the viewer invested. But if you\'re looking for a conclusion, I\'m sorry to say it\'s in another castle. The criminal is still at large, a clear motive is never given to tie it all...up and at the end of it you feel it was less about the mystery and more about the crime solving pair\'s brief run-in with the enigma that is Magata Shiki and what effect this had on their relationship. Seriously. All of that just so the main protagonists could awkwardly take it to first base? Ok. Whatever.Decent build-up, poor conclusion.6/10 up and at the end of it you feel it was less about the mystery and more about the crime solving pair\'s brief run-in with the enigma that is Magata Shiki and what effect this had on their relationship. Seriously. All of that just so the main protagonists could awkwardly take it to first base? Ok. Whatever.Decent build-up, poor conclusion.6/10', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Have you ever thought about the concept of nothing?Nothing means no books, no chairs, no phones. It means no mirrors, no cards, no pillows. Even when all of these physical objects are gone, there is still more to remove. No air, no light, no electromagnetic forces, no atoms, no thoughts.No anything.Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider goes the opposite way. “Everything” is just as crazy as “nothing.” Now those books and those pillows and those atoms are around, but that is not enough. Even when you think you collected it all, there is...still more to collect. And then some.“Everything” means everything to The Perfect Insider. But while it did not collect everything, it still provides a pretty strong anime.STORYThe Perfect Insider would, from the outside, appear to be a mystery anime. And this description is true. An unexplainable set of events occur, the characters all work together to find an explanation, and a satisfactory solution is singled out. Over the course of eleven episodes, the anime does just this.But from the inside, the anime is that second genre: psychological.To be more precise, the anime is philosophical. The mystery acts as a buffer for the philosophical ideas that The Perfect Insider toys with. Questioning “Who are you?” is a common line of thinking for the anime. Discussing the nature of the body versus the soul is where the anime feels safest. Trying to define the concept of freedom or love makes the anime content.Tying each of these ideas together is another idea, one that is the most important to the anime and is another difficult philosophical concept.Death.There is a surprising amount of death in the show. The death of Dr. Magata’s daughter. The death of her parents. The death of her twin brother and maid. The death of Director Shindou. The death of Nishinosono’s parents. Death surrounds the anime.A lot of words are said by the The Perfect Insider about death. But, succinctly, the anime comes to its conclusion through Dr. Magata: Death is a cure.The problem is in the presentation. The anime barfs all of this information in the audience’s lap within the last two episodes. The other ideas are posited, creating a foundation for the idea of death, but deeper exploration of death happens almost too late. It unfortunately has to be this way: The rest of the season has to focus on the mystery and the positing. Hence, the anime’s philosophical take on death, while wildly interesting, fails to reach the audience in an easily digestible manner.Yet, is that not the point? The philosophical questions are hard to understand because they are, well, hard to understand. Dr. Magata is an anomaly. She thinks in a way that nobody else has ever done before. And, in a way, the audience is not supposed to understand what she is thinking. Because, as Saikawa-sensei aptly and contextually puts it, we are “programmed” to think differently from this insane, unique genius.But this barf is hard to swallow. Life is a beautiful opportunity. Life gives people fun and places to visit and different hobbies and relationships and information to learn and food worth trekking those extra few minutes to get and anime to watch and happiness. That is, life is (and relevantly) everything.“A flower wilts for the sake of a new seed” is the anime justifying a child killing its mother. “Isn’t the instinctive desire of beings, born not of their own volition, for their lives to be taken in the same way?” is the anime trying to make the murdering of others appear normal.These notions are not justifiable. These notions are not normal. They are ridiculous. They are ridiculous because death is not the answer. Death removes life. And since life is everything, death removes everything. Providing – by equivalency – nothing.Beyond the philosophical themes lays the narrative itself which is comprised of two timelines.The first is the present. Here, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei work together with the staff of the island laboratory to solve the mystery surrounding them. The second is the past. Here, Director Shindou and Dr. Magata – as a young teenager – slowly reveal what happened all those years ago. The past timeline usually appears at the end of most episodes since nearly every scene from the past is filled with suspense and important information. I.e., a cliffhanger.This past-and-present technique is simple and common but effective. Having the narrative split, flip-flopping between the present and the past, ramps up the mystery. It helps to make the proceedings more confusing, more unknown to the audience.Yet the anime more or less confuses itself when it commits a big crime of its own: It rarely shows what happened “behind the scenes.” For example, Dr. Magata and her child are only shown together at the end. Before the end, the audience gets nothing. The audience is not given a view of them in their secluded “home” or an idea of their daily lives or what the child thought of her mother and vice versa.Another example is Dr. Magata and Director Shindou. While they have more scenes together than the mother and daughter – like riding a Ferris wheel or at a hotel – there are still not enough interactions shown to make their relationship appear worthwhile.Not having these and the other set of interactions arguably ramps up the mystery further. Which is a nice argument. But it also prevents the audience from fully understanding Dr. Magata and, by extension, the philosophical reasoning she oft leans on.The Perfect Insider’s narrative also leans but on a plot contrivance. Later on in the season, a futuristic pod device is introduced. A big problem is that the pod was never mentioned. But even more problematic is what it is used for.First, the pod reveals to Nishinosono a hugely important set of details from her past. And second, the pod gives Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei the opportunity to speak with Dr. Magata. Because the pod is so restricted in its use, it comes off as too niche. As such, events that should be worthwhile to the narrative come off as overly convenient.As for the mystery itself, the anime does well. The details that make up the mystery are rather clever. A pregnancy, hexadecimal code, and imitation of a nonexistent sister keep the audience guessing for the duration of the anime. While it may have been best to actually show Dr. Magata going through some of these actions – the murder of her daughter, her creating the Trojan code – what is most important is keeping its events a mystery which The Perfect Insider did.The Perfect Insider does come full-circle with its narrative when it references the magic trick and the t-shirts, but there are too many problems beforehand that weigh the anime down.ANIMATIONActual animation in The Perfect Insider remains relatively average. However, certain actions, like a character speaking or hair billowing or Saikawa-sensei failing to put in his eye drops, prove the anime can heighten its actual animation when it wants to.Regardless of what level of animation is going on, the anime places extra care in its art, presenting visuals that are almost always meaningful. For example, the art does not just have the characters moving around. The art actively characterizes the cast.In one episode. Nishinosono calls her butler back home. When he takes too long in his reply, she gets impatient. The audience sees her impatience plastered on her face and, more strikingly, in the fidgeting of the mouse pointer on the computer screen.In the same episode, Saikawa-sensei is smoking a cigarette. (As he always does.) He speaks half of his sentence, inhales some smoke, and then exhales it. As if the smoke cleared his mind, he readjusts what he says.In a different episode, Dr. Magata sits in her chair, looking like a doll. It is not until Director Shindou arrives that her face lights up and she begins to animate.Tiny details like these say so much about the characters without resorting to exposition. And the anime uses such subtleties a lot.To reiterate, The Perfect Insider contains a lot of expository material in the form of narration and monologues. Furthermore, the anime takes place on one island and (for the most part) within one building. As such, the anime puts as much care into its artistic direction as it does its art. But, rather than adding character depth, these details are designed to engage the audience.A wonderful example is in the fourth episode. Director Shindou starts with a small bit of narration: “I heard her voice. Or more precisely, their….” The anime then proceeds to have Dr. Magata, currently a young teenager, speak to herself with her multiple personalities. But rather than just showing her talking to herself, the anime constantly shifts the perspective.One perspective positions itself behind Director Shindou. One aims at her from her right side. One faces the mirror in front of her. One sits outside the barely ajar door. The scene does not last long, and the technique is subtle, but the different perspectives mirror the different personalities of Dr. Magata, making it hard to know “who” is really speaking.Sometimes, these visuals derive from one’s imagination. The purple water in Nishinosono’s nightmare subconsciously reminds her of her purple dress. The cold, enclosed interrogation room for Nishinosono and the warm, open patio for Saikawa-sensei indicate the feelings between these two and Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata and her daughter riding on the back of a camel in the desert evokes a sense of endless discovery for that “perfect answer” the doctor says does not exist.The opening track and ending track likewise mire themselves in imagination. The traced dance number in the opening track symbolizes the “dance” the characters have with each other. And the inner guts of some software forming an image of the doctor in the ending track symbolizes the “software” that makes up who people are.(A special shout-out goes to Nishinosono’s small jig in the middle of the opening track. Her body bobbing and head bobbing are strangely alluring.)More often than not, however, the visuals ground themselves in reality. Said realism comes from not just the lighting and the setting but also the character designs. People in The Perfect Insider wear regular clothes, varying in eye, nose, and mouth shapes to get at diversity without resorting to crazy.The main cast – Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata – are the same, but, as the mains, they have a few extra details. Nishinosono’s short hair and baby face visually paint her as a naïve child. Saikawa-sensei’s many t-shirts signify his “many eyes” as Dr. Magata puts it. As for Dr. Magata, her white gown represents her “pure” disposition.Overall, the The Perfect Insider leverages its art as much as possible to present a wonderful-looking anime.CHARACTERSThe Perfect Insider approaches its characters in a strange way.The audience learns a bit about Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata throughout the season. Nishinosono can manipulate large numbers, has a deep affection for Saikawa-sensei, and lost her parents at too young of an age. Saikawa-sensei deals with life in a calm, logical manner, smoking cigarettes and making silly jokes to pass the time. And Dr. Magata slept with her uncle, killed her parents, and hid herself away for fifteen years before reemerging to seek death.Weirdly, the individual characters do not matter. They neither develop within the narrative nor impact it. What is truly important is the faux love triangle that exists between the three main players: Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata.The whole dynamic is, perhaps obviously, complicated. But the best way to describe it is in terms of getting and understanding. “Getting” means seeing what another is saying. “Understanding” means seeing and comprehending what another is saying. That is, one cannot understand another without first getting them, but one can get another without understanding them. (Confused yet?)An example. Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei. She knows when he is lying. She gets his sense of humor. She tends to know what he thinks. But her love for him, a love she feels is not reciprocated but instead aimed at Dr. Magata, prevents her from completely understanding him. Part of her character arc involves moving closer to the understanding side: learning just how much Saikawa-sensei helped her in the past lets her understand him differently.Yet she cannot get Dr. Magata. She questions the doctor, and she is flabbergasted at how the doctor finds killing her own parents – when Nishinosono tragically lost her own – a simple, justifiable move.Saikawa-sensei completely understands Nishinosono. He knows how to make her laugh. He had been there for her during the lowest point in her life. He accepts her “contradictions” as he puts it. But, with Dr. Magata, he only gets her. He does not understand her. He admires her for who she is. He gets what she says, but he cannot fully understand her mindset.Dr. Magata, as the flawless character she happens to be, completely understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. She understands Nishinosono because of her apathy towards humans, her thinking similar thoughts (as episode two showcases), and her not having parents either. And since Saikawa-sensei has a “very similar structure,” she understands how he operates, too.In summary, Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei but does not get Dr. Magata. Saikawa-sensei understands Nishinosono but only gets Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. (Still following?)The dynamics are complicated. But why? Why create such a convoluted set of dynamics? Why focus so much on their interpersonal connections rather than their intrapersonal selves?The Perfect Insider’s narrative bases itself on the answer to this question. The anime is, after all, a mystery. However, the answer finally manifests within the last ten minutes or so of the season.Two separate scenes in these last ten minutes are shown. In the real world, Saikawa-sensei recounts a story about Nishinosono’s father. In the imaginary world, Dr. Magata talks with her daughter about humanity. Both conversations revolve around the same theme: questioning and answering.People are constantly questioning. Questioning the world is what drives people forward. And, by extension, people are constantly trying to find answers to these questions. Nishinosono questioned “Why do people live?” Saikawa-sensei’s answers got her laughing again. Dr. Magata’s daughter questioned herself, so she sought “freedom.” Dr. Magata questioned Saikawa-sensei in the ocean, and, after hearing his creative response – “Because you can’t smoke underwater.” – she wanted to meet him once more.Dr. Magata phrases it best: “If they [humans] knew everything, they would attempt nothing. If they attempted nothing, nothing new would happen. Humans seek answers to the things they do not know. That is how kindness, nostalgia, joy, and fun are born.”In other words, questioning the world and finding those answers allows people to get, allows people to understand. To get and understand the world, thoughts, and, most importantly, people.This directive is The Perfect Insider’s main message. Question others, question ourselves. Only then can answers be found. A “perfect answer,” as Dr. Magata says, may never, ever be discovered. But so long as people question, answers will follow.In other words, to understand each other, people simply have to ask, “Who are you?”SOUNDAlongside the art, the sound-work of The Perfect Insider is one of its strongest aspects.The opening track comes out on top. Its upbeat vibe completely contrasts with the mysterious vibe of the anime, making the track feel even more fun. The vocalist does a wonderful job, too, with the step-wise, quick, and “Yea!” lyrics. And, as is pretty much required for a dance song, the track is quite catchy. Made so by the drums, the guitar, and the not-too-fast-and-not-too-slow-but-just-right speed. The OP is a fantastic track that is more than worth listening to both inside and outside of the anime.The ending track is a step down, but that is not saying all that much. The dual female and male vocalists working together symbolizes Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei doing the same. The different techno sound-effects fit the computerized motif. The toned-down build-up in the middle. That held lyric. The sudden and not-long-lasting loss of music near the end. All of these details, combined with the catchiness, make the ED into yet another strong track offered by the anime.Not wanting to be outdone, the rest of the original soundtrack does well too. Tension-filled tracks made up of fast violins and harps. Soft, piano-and-flute tracks for those extremely pleasant moments. And melancholic tracks composed of violins and chimes. These more classical tracks, alongside the more mysterious ones, set up and fit the atmosphere of the anime quite well, making the OST another strong addition to the anime.Voice acting performances are similarly high in execution. Yasuyuki Kase as Saikawa-sensei uses an older, reserved voice that suits the cigarette-loving teacher and that does not get annoying to hear for long periods of time. Atsumi Tanezaki as Nishinosono uses a cute voice that is both mature and young, reflecting the girl’s same disposition. And Ibuki Kido as Dr. Magata has a calm, plain way of speaking. Her voice captures the doctor’s levelheadedness which accentuates her rare, more emotional outbursts.The Perfect Insider also deserves huge props for a scene that somewhat came out of nowhere. In episode seven, Saikawa-sensei talks to Dr. Magata’s “sister.” The cool part is they both do so in English. The coolest part is that the scene lasts a really long time. And when the audience thinks they are done, they keep going. Cleverly, it distracts the audience from thinking that the “sister” is actually Dr. Magata, especially when she speaks in the third person.ENJOYMENTI liked this one. And I certainly appreciated what it did. It might be as opposite to a “turn your brain off” anime as an anime can get. The deep, philosophical questions were (obviously) the reason for this.The anime forced me to spend a lot of time dissecting what it was trying to say. While that may be an indicator that the anime delivered its message unsuccessfully – me literally having to type out their conversations, verbatim, in order to have their exact thoughts close by seems a little absurd – it gave me the chance to question.I thought about my own ideals. I thought about the ideals of others. I thought about life and death and myself. Not many anime can make me do that.The mystery itself was okay but nothing I was ever taken in by. Mostly because the stakes never felt high, and the payoff was lackluster. Dr. Magata was okay, too. I am not a big fan of perfect characters; I would have liked to have seen her challenged more. The whole point is that she was perfect, but her being so flawless made her less interesting than she could have been.I did like the “romance” between Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, though. Her storming out into the hallway and yelling to herself out of frustration when she learned about Saikawa-sensei staying over at another woman’s (his sister, unbeknownst to Nishinosono) place made me chuckle. Or Nishinosono declaring that she, not Saikawa-sensei’s sister, would be buying his shirts from now on made me laugh. And just the teasing, natural dialogue they shared with each other made me smile on more than a few occasions.Nishinosono herself could be cute and fun, too. Kicking out the female lab worker because she was getting too buddy-buddy with Saikawa-sensei – “Door, close!” – had me laughing since this small act was both funny and true to her personality. And her appearing grossed out by the fact that Saikawa-sensei wanted her to call him an “idiot” had me grinning. A lot of these moments overlapped with her relationship to Saikawa-sensei, but they were, nonetheless, entertaining.Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider has some highs and some lows. More highs than lows. The art and the music are extremely strong, but the story and the characters, despite the philosophy, could have been executed better. In the end, the anime did neither everything nor nothing. But it did, at least, do something.SUMMARYStory: Bad, while the mystery itself is constructed well, a ridiculous take on death, the lack of important interactions, and an unfortunate plot contrivance each weigh the narrative downAnimation: Great, subtleties, reality, and imaginary come together to create a visually impressive treatCharacters: Fine, Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata are not strong characters on an individual basis, but their interpersonal relationships nicely explore the theme on questioning and answersSound: Great, fantastic OP, great ED, nice OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, the mystery and Dr. Magata were okay, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, especially Nishinosono, were fun, and it forced self-reflectionFinal Score: 7/10 still more to collect.

He gets what she says, but he cannot fully understand her mindset.Dr. Magata, as the flawless character she happens to be, completely understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. She understands Nishinosono because of her apathy towards humans, her thinking similar thoughts (as episode two showcases), and her not having parents either. And since Saikawa-sensei has a “very similar structure,” she understands how he operates, too.In summary, Nishinosono gets Saikawa-sensei but does not get Dr. Magata. Saikawa-sensei understands Nishinosono but only gets Dr. Magata. Dr. Magata understands both Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei. (Still following?)The dynamics are complicated. But why? Why create such a convoluted set of dynamics? Why focus so much on their interpersonal connections rather than their intrapersonal selves?The Perfect Insider’s narrative bases itself on the answer to this question. The anime is, after all, a mystery. However, the answer finally manifests within the last ten minutes or so of the season.Two separate scenes in these last ten minutes are shown. In the real world, Saikawa-sensei recounts a story about Nishinosono’s father. In the imaginary world, Dr. Magata talks with her daughter about humanity. Both conversations revolve around the same theme: questioning and answering.People are constantly questioning. Questioning the world is what drives people forward. And, by extension, people are constantly trying to find answers to these questions. Nishinosono questioned “Why do people live?” Saikawa-sensei’s answers got her laughing again. Dr. Magata’s daughter questioned herself, so she sought “freedom.” Dr. Magata questioned Saikawa-sensei in the ocean, and, after hearing his creative response – “Because you can’t smoke underwater.” – she wanted to meet him once more.Dr. Magata phrases it best: “If they [humans] knew everything, they would attempt nothing. If they attempted nothing, nothing new would happen. Humans seek answers to the things they do not know. That is how kindness, nostalgia, joy, and fun are born.”In other words, questioning the world and finding those answers allows people to get, allows people to understand. To get and understand the world, thoughts, and, most importantly, people.This directive is The Perfect Insider’s main message. Question others, question ourselves. Only then can answers be found. A “perfect answer,” as Dr. Magata says, may never, ever be discovered. But so long as people question, answers will follow.In other words, to understand each other, people simply have to ask, “Who are you?”SOUNDAlongside the art, the sound-work of The Perfect Insider is one of its strongest aspects.The opening track comes out on top. Its upbeat vibe completely contrasts with the mysterious vibe of the anime, making the track feel even more fun. The vocalist does a wonderful job, too, with the step-wise, quick, and “Yea!” lyrics. And, as is pretty much required for a dance song, the track is quite catchy. Made so by the drums, the guitar, and the not-too-fast-and-not-too-slow-but-just-right speed. The OP is a fantastic track that is more than worth listening to both inside and outside of the anime.The ending track is a step down, but that is not saying all that much. The dual female and male vocalists working together symbolizes Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei doing the same. The different techno sound-effects fit the computerized motif. The toned-down build-up in the middle. That held lyric. The sudden and not-long-lasting loss of music near the end. All of these details, combined with the catchiness, make the ED into yet another strong track offered by the anime.Not wanting to be outdone, the rest of the original soundtrack does well too. Tension-filled tracks made up of fast violins and harps. Soft, piano-and-flute tracks for those extremely pleasant moments. And melancholic tracks composed of violins and chimes. These more classical tracks, alongside the more mysterious ones, set up and fit the atmosphere of the anime quite well, making the OST another strong addition to the anime.Voice acting performances are similarly high in execution. Yasuyuki Kase as Saikawa-sensei uses an older, reserved voice that suits the cigarette-loving teacher and that does not get annoying to hear for long periods of time. Atsumi Tanezaki as Nishinosono uses a cute voice that is both mature and young, reflecting the girl’s same disposition. And Ibuki Kido as Dr. Magata has a calm, plain way of speaking. Her voice captures the doctor’s levelheadedness which accentuates her rare, more emotional outbursts.The Perfect Insider also deserves huge props for a scene that somewhat came out of nowhere. In episode seven, Saikawa-sensei talks to Dr. Magata’s “sister.” The cool part is they both do so in English. The coolest part is that the scene lasts a really long time. And when the audience thinks they are done, they keep going. Cleverly, it distracts the audience from thinking that the “sister” is actually Dr. Magata, especially when she speaks in the third person.ENJOYMENTI liked this one. And I certainly appreciated what it did. It might be as opposite to a “turn your brain off” anime as an anime can get. The deep, philosophical questions were (obviously) the reason for this.The anime forced me to spend a lot of time dissecting what it was trying to say. While that may be an indicator that the anime delivered its message unsuccessfully – me literally having to type out their conversations, verbatim, in order to have their exact thoughts close by seems a little absurd – it gave me the chance to question.I thought about my own ideals. I thought about the ideals of others. I thought about life and death and myself. Not many anime can make me do that.The mystery itself was okay but nothing I was ever taken in by. Mostly because the stakes never felt high, and the payoff was lackluster. Dr. Magata was okay, too. I am not a big fan of perfect characters; I would have liked to have seen her challenged more. The whole point is that she was perfect, but her being so flawless made her less interesting than she could have been.I did like the “romance” between Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, though. Her storming out into the hallway and yelling to herself out of frustration when she learned about Saikawa-sensei staying over at another woman’s (his sister, unbeknownst to Nishinosono) place made me chuckle. Or Nishinosono declaring that she, not Saikawa-sensei’s sister, would be buying his shirts from now on made me laugh. And just the teasing, natural dialogue they shared with each other made me smile on more than a few occasions.Nishinosono herself could be cute and fun, too. Kicking out the female lab worker because she was getting too buddy-buddy with Saikawa-sensei – “Door, close!” – had me laughing since this small act was both funny and true to her personality. And her appearing grossed out by the fact that Saikawa-sensei wanted her to call him an “idiot” had me grinning. A lot of these moments overlapped with her relationship to Saikawa-sensei, but they were, nonetheless, entertaining.Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider has some highs and some lows. More highs than lows. The art and the music are extremely strong, but the story and the characters, despite the philosophy, could have been executed better. In the end, the anime did neither everything nor nothing. But it did, at least, do something.SUMMARYStory: Bad, while the mystery itself is constructed well, a ridiculous take on death, the lack of important interactions, and an unfortunate plot contrivance each weigh the narrative downAnimation: Great, subtleties, reality, and imaginary come together to create a visually impressive treatCharacters: Fine, Nishinosono, Saikawa-sensei, and Dr. Magata are not strong characters on an individual basis, but their interpersonal relationships nicely explore the theme on questioning and answersSound: Great, fantastic OP, great ED, nice OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, the mystery and Dr. Magata were okay, Nishinosono and Saikawa-sensei, especially Nishinosono, were fun, and it forced self-reflectionFinal Score: 7/10', ""The accusation of being 'pretentious' has been lobbed at Subete ga F ni Naru quite often. This is unfair, considering the author actually worked as a researcher for quite a while. The integration of maths and computer science elements into the story is basic (in concession to the audience) but does bring a unique flavour into what would otherwise be a standard locked room mystery. The story starts off slowly, setting up the characters and story with dry factual dialogue, but as events unfold, more elements are added to the mystery and the relationship between Moe and Souhei becomes more fleshed out, leading to some...more compelling drama in the second half. Magata Shiki's past also adds an edge and strangeness to the story that fans of psychological anime will appreciate.While the story is good, Subete ga F ni Naru's problem is that it follows the structure of the novel too closely, or at least it appears that way from someone who never read it. The setting and events are static, and with mature, realistic characters, even with the same script it feels this would be better realised in live action with good actors. The pacing is also a tad too slow; where 'show, don't tell' is an important principle in literature it is surely doubly important in television. The drab colour palette visually reinforces this impression, although by and large the audiovisual quality of this series is very good, with very expressive facial animation in important scenes.If you're looking for a straight, compelling mystery told through the anime medium, Subete ga F ni Naru is the show for you.

There were a lot of good things being said about this anime so I decided to watch it. The first episode wasn't anything special and it didn't really introduce the audience to the story. However, I don't judge an anime by its first episodes so I went along with it. Honestly, I didn't understand what people found so exciting about the first episode, I can only guess it was when Seikawa asked Nishinosono 'What are the 3 big questions of life' to which she replied 'Who am I? Why am I here? And...where will I go?' Now, if you like anime with big psychological plots and questions, this might be the perfect anime for you.The story was different and for the most part kept you interested and involved although there were times where it felt like the story stopped in order for the characters to talk about the deepest of the deepest of stuff. Again, if you like deep and emotional(less) dialogues in anime, this will be perfect for you. As for the pace, the story does start slow and like it doesn't have much to offer but after about 3 or 4 episodes, it does start to get interesting.The art was dull and gloomy although this does add to the mystery and the eerie feel in the anime. It wasn't anything special so if you decide to watch Subete ga F ni Naru don't expect amazing art. Good News though! If you like funky openings with pretty colours and awesome music then you're going to like the one for Subete ga F ni Naru. It's one of the things that I enjoyed about the anime although when I first watched it I thought the anime was going to be about something completely different.There's not much to say about the sound. The music used for the opening and the ending was catchy and I have it in my playlist but there wasn't much sound or sound effects, not that I noticed anyway so if there was some music during the scenes, the producers didn't do a very good job at making me realise it therefore making it impossible to appreciate the beauty of music.The characters were interesting, I don't think there was one character in the anime that I didn't like. Each character looked different and I probably won't be seeing any other anime characters that look similar to the ones in Subete ga F ni Naru. This is another thing that I enjoyed about he anime, the individualistic characters and their simple yet unique design. Their personalities were also all so distinct and contrasting and not one character had the same personality as the other.Overall, the anime was pretty decent and quite enjoyable although it does start of slow and ordinary but does pick up the pace and keeps the audience wanting more. I wouldn't consider this anime to be a high priority to watch but it definitely deserves to be given a chance, this might one day become a classic.(Story= 7, Art= 6, Sound= 4, Character= 8, Enjoyment= 7, Overall=7) where will I go?'

Most of it was just philophaster nonsense that was presented in an inappropriate way. It was also in no way philosophical. It was almost on the level of Jayden Smith\'s tweets. The first few episodes seem to try to show the relationship between Moe and Saikawa except the first episode already establishes their relationship and the following episodes do nothing to expand...that; all they do is continue with the philsophaster nonsense.However, around midway, this is when the show becomes interesting, as this is when the mystery really begins. The elements and clues presented throughout the episodes thenceforth were directly related to the story and you don\'t feel like something random that was not presented earlier, just shows up. Also, as a computer scientist, I love how they implemented hexadecimal into the story. This all relates back to ""Subete ga F Ni Naru"".So how was it overall? I\'d say it okay. You could probably watch the first episode, then skip the next few and you wouldn\'t miss a thing.

However, it is normally very hard to get it right, especially in anime. I can probably count on one hand, maybe two, the amount of generally well recieved mystery anime in the community. So, how does The Perfect Insider fare?The first thing that struck me right off the bat was it's pacing. For an 11 episode show to only introduce the core mystery at the end of episode 2 indicates just how slow this show is. Surprisingly though, nothing really feels rushed even with only 8 or so episodes...to complete the mystery. The mystery is exceptionally well-realized, and the slow pace adds to the atmosphere that the mystery and the characters build from the ground up.The mystery itself is very effective. If you pay enough attention, you might just be able to figure out the mystery yourself. It's a mystery that is fairly logical, works well off the characters, and the answer isn't obvious.  It creates one of the best things a mystery anime can do, which is keep you guessing to try and figure out the mystery for yourself. It's not perfect, as there are a couple things left to plot convenience and the reliance of the incredibly smart main characters, but those moments are thankfully few and far between.As for characters, the two leads work off each other very well. They have fairly unique character interactions with one another, good backstories, ideals, and the like. They were interesting leads to follow, and reacted to the core mystery in a way that makes sense while never breaking the tone of the show as a whole.And then we have Magata Shiki, undisputedly the best part of the show. Her take on human life alone makes her a worthwhile character. So many things, big and little alike, encompass this character to create a wholly 3-dimensional person. I'm not going to mention much more than that as she's a character better left experienced by the viewer rather than some random internet twat telling you about her. :)The biggest flaw in the show also resides in the character section, and that is the side characters. None of them were really that interesting at all, but when the main characters have as much depth as they do, it doesn't really take away to have lackluster side characters.The art is very well done as well. The character designs are top-tier, but the thing that really struck me the most was the amount of white that was used, both as light and in the colour palette. This again adds to the more surreal atmosphere this show emanates. Overall, a step up quality wise than what A-1 pictures normally puts out nowadays. The soundtrack has both a calming and eerie feel to it, which worked very effectively. I wasn't a big fan of the opening for a while, as it really doesn't fit in with the show at all. And while I stand by that statement, the song by itself is pretty damn catchy.As far as mystery anime goes, The Perfect Insider is certainly one of the better ones. The core mystery engages the viewer with it's simplistic premise, and keeps them engaged with it's more complicated innerworkings. However, it's the unique yet intriguing main characters and their interpretations on the main themes of The Perfect Insider that really hit it home for me. And I mean come on, Saikawa fucking moonwalks in an episode, so it's worth the watch just for that. Certainly one of the better shows to come out of 2015, and I'd say if you don't mind the slow pace, give it a try. to complete the mystery.

My most recent such application was the epic manga Kozure Ookami. The one genre that you can not apply this maxim is the murder mystery. Subete ga F ni Naru had a poor ending of such magnitude that I cannot recommend it to anyone, and this review should end right here.Somebody might ask “yes, but what about the journey?” So for reasons of thoroughness and fairness, I shall...continue. The anime immediately shows typical noitaminA stylization with a great OP (the ED is also good), although when the actual episode begins we are served with mediocre animation. It's probably a matter of taste, but I really don't like poorly rendered 3d CGI objects festering the scenes.The other major issue is the characters. The main “detective duo” is pretty cool, we have the genius ojou-sama and the “genuis-er” professor, but throughout the 11 episodes we learn nothing more of substance about them and no development occurs. But our duo is not the main problem, the main problem about the characters is the supporting cast: there are characters that have the potential of becoming interesting and we wait to discover how they will factor in the story etc, but nothing happens, they just disappear in the background. Magata's sister is the prime example. This anime looked pretty interesting in the first three episodes, but then simply blew over. Magata's character is pretty complex and interesting, but again: the poor ending ruins everything.Magata's character brings us to the only strength of the anime: It offers some philosophical thoughts worth contemplating (mainly using Magata as the transmission vessel). Also the lab structure as a self-sustaining micro-society of intellectuals is a beautiful contraption. So around Magata, the writes manages to create a beautiful setting, which I imagine is the sole reason for his success with this work.I will not spoil anything about the end, I'll just say that it has major timing issues and that it demands that we accept actions and motives based on their aesthetic value, completely disregarding logic or offering a valid explanation. You get a “wow” moment in episode 9 but that's it. Oh, and the “F reveal” is pretty dumb.The murder mystery portion of the anime ends in episode 10, the final episode is a few pretentious dialog and a hormone overflowing Nishinosono. The fact that they gave up on the cyberpunk charm of the earlier episodes annoyed me; instead they chose to do the lazy “people talking on changing backgrounds”.As I already said this anime fails as a murder mystery, but I imagine the near-future-cyberpunk aesthetics may make some people happy. The whole manga/anime industry seems to fail hard at the crime mystery genre (if someone thinks I'm wrong about this point, I would love to hear suggestions), so for the genre's lovers I would recommend the first season of Broadchurch and the Murder on orient express (1974).

As for the story, the main plot line itself, the mystery about which it all revolves, I confess I did not find it too interesting and found myself asking a question at the start which proved to be the correct path of reasoning.  Still, I quite enjoyed this...anime, and will go on to explain why I do liken it to a peaceful dream.In this anime our primary characters are all geniuses who can perform calculator operations in their heads without a moment\'s thought, are well regarded by the world despite each begin a recluse in their own way, and strangely enough within this anime their genius means they\'re each philosophically inclined.  Now as often happens when writing about people smarter then ourselves, many of the arguments, chains of reasoning, and claims of these characters could be easily poked full of holes by any deeper thought, but the real guts of the anime are the philosophical abstractions that get tossed about, or at least they are in my book.  Are we really meat and bone, or are we consciousness?  What can we define as a distinct individual when we collect multiple personalities within an individual, or when we acknowledge that no one personality is necessarily inherent to a body in and of itself?  Now, because they\'re all geniuses discussing deep topics the story does not scrutinize their thoughts to the extend to riddling them with holes, but rather glides along with them, much as logic might follow in a dream where in truth the contradictions matter little in the face of the new thoughts and ideas they might give birth to, and to me this seemed to be the dominant theme of the anime.  Still, having given critical and non-critical thought alike to the anime, I enjoyed the notions it expressed.While it\'s not too hard to find anime that tackle the nihilism behind our  not knowing precisely why we exist, this anime deviates from the grittier dark side of not knowing, and instead embraces that whilst we do irrationally fear ""death"", and we don\'t really know the answers to the big questions about life, accepting its lack of logic at times and emphasizing that that sometimes the simple seemingly random habits of life themselves are the answer to these questions however nonsense that may be.  I also enjoyed that this anime did not belabor the point by lingering endlessly on just these questions, delving into deep brooding depression for episodes on end as the characters thought their way through them, but rather it somewhat playfully tossed out questions and answers both as free floating thoughts more in the spirit of a stream of consciousness then as a logically defined argument or a dramatic plot line.  And that is why it is that I associate the feel of this anime to that of a peaceful dream, flowing on through ceaseless thoughts without violent refutes or blood rushing excitement.  I cannot say if you\'ll like this anime as I have, but that is not something for me to decide, it\'s something for you. anime, and will go on to explain why I do liken it to a peaceful dream.In this anime our primary characters are all geniuses who can perform calculator operations in their heads without a moment\'s thought, are well regarded by the world despite each begin a recluse in their own way, and strangely enough within this anime their genius means they\'re each philosophically inclined.

What can we define as a distinct individual when we collect multiple personalities within an individual, or when we acknowledge that no one personality is necessarily inherent to a body in and of itself?  Now, because they\'re all geniuses discussing deep topics the story does not scrutinize their thoughts to the extend to riddling them with holes, but rather glides along with them, much as logic might follow in a dream where in truth the contradictions matter little in the face of the new thoughts and ideas they might give birth to, and to me this seemed to be the dominant theme of the anime.  Still, having given critical and non-critical thought alike to the anime, I enjoyed the notions it expressed.While it\'s not too hard to find anime that tackle the nihilism behind our  not knowing precisely why we exist, this anime deviates from the grittier dark side of not knowing, and instead embraces that whilst we do irrationally fear ""death"", and we don\'t really know the answers to the big questions about life, accepting its lack of logic at times and emphasizing that that sometimes the simple seemingly random habits of life themselves are the answer to these questions however nonsense that may be.  I also enjoyed that this anime did not belabor the point by lingering endlessly on just these questions, delving into deep brooding depression for episodes on end as the characters thought their way through them, but rather it somewhat playfully tossed out questions and answers both as free floating thoughts more in the spirit of a stream of consciousness then as a logically defined argument or a dramatic plot line.  And that is why it is that I associate the feel of this anime to that of a peaceful dream, flowing on through ceaseless thoughts without violent refutes or blood rushing excitement.  I cannot say if you\'ll like this anime as I have, but that is not something for me to decide, it\'s something for you.', '""There is no perfect answer.

It's necessarily slow paced to build atmosphere and mystery, but that often made it a bit boring. When everything was ultimately revealed, while it was kind of clever, it just didn't make much of an impression on me.Part of it is that there's so much...empty philosophizing.

What made the story unique was the way we as viewers were presented with the mystery. For the most part, we were only shown as much as the characters were and got the opportunity to solve it alongside them.The characters themselves were great (although sometimes they were a little 'bland' or 'boring' as they weren't always able to fully express themselves or their emotions). The relationship between the two mains is explored to a certain extent (as much as can be done in 13 eps) however, the main focus...throughout the anime is the mystery at hand.Along with the soundtrack and the fantastic art style, I found this anime thoroughly enjoyable to watch.

Heck, I didn\'t even know that it was a mystery (which was a nice treat for me), but I\'m assuming you know at least that much if you\'re reading this. Anyway, I recommend watching this, especially if you\'re into thinking philosophically and solving mysteries as it\'s one of the best shows/movies I\'ve seen in that regard, never mind just in the anime. You can come back and read the review later if you don\'t...want to be expecting certain general things to come up during the show, which I think would provide the best experience.----------------------------------Do you know how mystery television or film falls into two categories? The ones that throw bogus clues and evidence out there to mislead you until the grand reveal and the ones that give you legitimate clues you can use to figure everything out without having to guess at some point before the end? Well, fortunately, this show falls into the latter category, and damn does it do a good job of it. I haven\'t had the pleasure of watching much, if anything, that struck this kind of balance in a long time. Generally speaking, I either have everything figured out, or there isn\'t enough info/too much misleading/incorrect info to get to a conclusion without a leap of faith or without waiting until right near the end. This anime gave us all the clues we needed to solve the mystery within the first 3 episodes if I remember correctly which is coincidentally around when the mystery starts. It\'s kind of novel to have a show give you everything you need to solve the mystery right around the time the mystery is in place. Well, to a certain extent anyway. There\'s more that gets filled out as you move through the story that could be considered key to figuring out what happened, but even those final bits are given to you a decent enough chunk of episodes before the end.Now that I\'ve established that they did the whole mystery thing basically flawlessly in my opinion, I would like to say that it has also been a treat to have one of these shows conduct themselves fairly and still manage to trick me, even while doling out clues the whole time. That doesn\'t happen very often. If I had to pick a criticism of the mystery, it\'s that if you\'re not paying very close attention, and if you\'re not...well, clever at this sort of thing, you may feel that the reveals come out of left field and are a load of crap - as many people who have reviewed this do.Onwards! The art and animation is really well done and the sound is definitely a treat. Their attention to detail really shows, especially during one of the best openings and one of the best endings I\'ve ever seen. The questions I found myself musing after and during every episode were also really well posited, if maybe a little shoehorned into things. That being said, I felt like it was in one of the main characters\' nature to speak the way he did and I found myself identifying with him more than anyone else. So while it was shoehorned, the character who was doing the philosophy shoehorning was doing it believably (for me at least - there are enough reviews that disagree, and I won\'t bother using the old ""They didn\'t understand"" or ""They didn\'t get the character"" arguments). For a longer, clearer, picture of why I liked this part of the show, read this review since I agree with pretty much everything they say http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=205880Now to the negative.The main bad thing I have to say about all of this (minus the usual personal opinion stuff that you\'ll decide for yourself if you watch it) is that the characters were pretty weak overall. I thought that each one served a purpose, and some of them were interesting enough, but it was definitely the plot, story, philosophy, and them making me think all the time that took me through this. If it was just the characters alone trying to carry this in a different situation, I don\'t think I would have been interested past the philosophical questions that the main character I was talking about spits out. This is in contrast to say, Death Note as the easy example, where I could watch L and Light trying to open competing hotdog stands and it would be enthralling. In The Perfect Insider, the characters are a vehicle for the story, not the other way around.

Its not an easy act to obtain a balance and I feel 'Perfect Insider' manages to do just that. It brings a few new things to the table and keeps it all real and consistent throughout.Episodes : 11Genre : Mystery, ThrillerFormat : One long mystery from start to end that spans across 11 episodesPeople it might appeal to : People...who like a good mystery and are fans of detective series or novels. People who don't mind a detailed in-depth case that takes its time to present all the facts and delve into the motives and psychology behind the suspects and victims.People it may not appeal to : People who want things crisp and quick and with a good dose of action. People looking for over-the-top action or comedy and expressive characters. People who get turned off by the slightest hint of psychology discussions, self-questioning, existentialism debates etc.Story : 9/10The synopsis explains the premise well. I wouldn't want to give further details coz its a mystery plot but I would like to say that overall its a good story. It has its exciting moments and a very fulfilling conclusion that befits the tone set at the start. It keeps you engaged throughout with new discoveries and clues in every episode that keep adding to the mystery. I cut 1 point because there are some very minor loopholes I could catch.Art : 8/10I really like this type of art. To give you a good idea the art is very similar to Ao no exorcist or Shin Sekai Yori. Its not very colorful or bright to be honest which I didn't mind. The characters are very well drawn with a focus on their facial expressions. At times though, there is a feeling of rigidity in scenes involving long conversations between characters.Sound : 8/10I totally loved the opening and ending themes and the visuals along with them. They are very different from your usual stuff and really caught my attention. I found myself listening to them in every episode without fail. Regarding the background score of the anime, I would say its ok. Nothing great. I guess the similarity of the tone and setting throughout the anime  doesn't really give too much scope for a varied musical score.Character : 9/10This is where I feel the anime really scores. Lots of times in mystery anime or novels, the characters just end up being mediums for discussion of the case and don't have real personality. Here, that has been avoided. Our main 3 characters are wonderfully done and each his/her own unique traits and habits. Saikawa-sensei beats down many cliches with his calm and almost lifeless demeanor. I actually enjoyed his character a lot. The crazy genius of Dr. Magata Shiki came across brilliantly and towards the end you start understanding her psyche. But, my favorite was Nishinosono who totally looked like someone who might irritate me at the start (Dont judge a book by its cover. Lesson learnt) but turned out a joy to watch. She's been crafted as a very smart and confident girl who has her weaknesses and demons too. Again the anime displayed a good balancing act by not making her too overbearing and all-knowing or damsel-like and ready-to-cry either. The interactions between these 3 are the highlights of the series. Again I've cut 1 coz the other support characters never really came out muchEnjoyment : 10/10I found myself wanting to see the next episode immediately after I completed one, was making guesses and theories after each clue was discussed and was amazingly fulfilled with the solution and conclusion of the case. If that doesn't count for a 10/10 on a mystery case, what does? Also, I really liked the conversations about existentialism, psychology etc. between the main characters. It never felt like going to the mind-fuck or above-your-head range (yes, I'm looking at you GITS!) but it presented some crazy ideas and theories nevertheless. And all of them were very relevant to the case not random plants to further the creators theories or anything.Overall : 9/10All in all, Perfect Insider gets a 9 from me. I might have been a little soft on this one coz I know its not easy to come up with a really good mystery. The anime has its minor flaws but I'm really willing to overlook them for all the good stuff it manages to do by the end of the ride. I was only wishing there were more mystery anime involving Saikawa and Nishinimono like the novels.If a good mystery or thriller is what gets you going, don't miss this one. who like a good mystery and are fans of detective series or novels.

Again I've cut 1 coz the other support characters never really came out muchEnjoyment : 10/10I found myself wanting to see the next episode immediately after I completed one, was making guesses and theories after each clue was discussed and was amazingly fulfilled with the solution and conclusion of the case. If that doesn't count for a 10/10 on a mystery case, what does? Also, I really liked the conversations about existentialism, psychology etc. between the main characters. It never felt like going to the mind-fuck or above-your-head range (yes, I'm looking at you GITS!) but it presented some crazy ideas and theories nevertheless. And all of them were very relevant to the case not random plants to further the creators theories or anything.Overall : 9/10All in all, Perfect Insider gets a 9 from me. I might have been a little soft on this one coz I know its not easy to come up with a really good mystery. The anime has its minor flaws but I'm really willing to overlook them for all the good stuff it manages to do by the end of the ride. I was only wishing there were more mystery anime involving Saikawa and Nishinimono like the novels.If a good mystery or thriller is what gets you going, don't miss this one."", 'The Perfect Insider isn’t an anime for everyone. As a mystery anime one can expect a dialogue-heavy presentation. This anime did have many expectations to exceed, due to the lack of genuine mystery anime in recent lineups. However, The Perfect Insider is quite an interesting murder mystery, as it primarily takes place in one location, focusing on a small cast of characters. Its slow pace creates tension at times, hoverer at times it can feel like a drag. Dialogue-heavy moments are at times interesting, however at times it seems it’s all leading to nowhere. However, as a mystery anime, it is important for its plot...to be good, but is it?~{Story}~The story is about a professor, Saikawa, and his mentor’s daughter, Nishinosono, travel to an island to meet Magata, an intelligent programmer and an idol to Saikawa. When the two get there, they find out Magata has been murdered. The plot revolves around the two trying to solve the problem, with sprinkles of Magata’s past being thrown around here and there. For a mystery anime to be any good, it must present a good storyline and this anime doesn’t disappoint. Though at times, it can be predictable for some, the buildup for its plot twists make the delivery great. The ending was very satisfying, especially after many episodes of buildup before it. But here is the problem, the anime heavily relies on buildup plot points to the point where the audience lose interest. The anime’s pacing, which I will talk about more later, is unfortunately very slow, as many episodes progress the story pinch-by-pinch. And as a dialogue-heavy anime, many of its dialogue rarely move the storyline and it feels like as if the writing is stalling with the audience. However, undeniably the anime still presents a very interesting storyline and at times it can get you at the edge of your seats.Story: 8/10~{Presentation}~As a mystery anime, the style of the anime does create a unique feel to it. Its cinematography style gives the anime a very cinematic feel which makes this anime better than what it is. However, as I mentioned before, the pacing is a massive drag at some points. You will watch some episodes, only to know the plot has moved barely an inch. Characters can talk for ten minutes, but only one is builds up the plot and two adds some character development. With the cinematic style of the anime, I couldn’t help but think how much better this anime would have been better if it was a two-hour long anime film rather than a series. The pacing would have been much more improved and it would feel more interesting for the audience. For a mystery, it is important to have a good pace to it. If it’s too fast, the suspense buildup won’t be there. If it’s too slow, it’s will start to break apart and feel less and less interesting. The Perfect Insider falls in the latter. However, its style does redeem it presentation by a bit.Presentation: 6/10~{Character}~The anime consists of three main characters, and the story revolves around their relationship with one another and how compatible they are together. The protagonist of the anime, Saikawa Souhei, is a very interesting character, as he is shown as times as a genius, and other times lost. His interactions with another main character, Nishinosono Moe, is fairly interesting, as most of the anime consists of conversations between the two. If both characters were uninteresting and dumb, the anime would have felt like a terrible drag, but luckily if manages to have great characters. Nishinosono at first felt like a dumb addition to the cast, however she quickly proved that her deductive and observation skills are top-notch, and at times, better than Saikawa. The anime’s third main character, Magata Shiki, is what makes this anime better than what it already is. She’s creepy, she’s mysterious, and she’s the one who leaves more questions unanswered than answered. Throughout the series, there’s sprinkles of her backstory here and there and they all manage to build up tension. This anime does have a sort of love triangle situation in some ways, but it’s too unique to be considered as one.Character: 8/10~{Art}~,As it is an A-1 Pictures anime, one can expect a lot to be delivered from here, and they didn’t disappoint. The art style however is far different from what they normally use. At first you will notice that the color palette is very limited, as every color has a greyish tint to it. This adds for a subtle, mysterious style for the anime and manages to make the situations feel more and more tense. And as most of the anime takes place in a facility, you’ll be seeing the color grey quite a lot. The backgrounds are very well detailed at times, and some of the more strange settings look great with their color palette. Character designs are also quite unique. Their facial structure has some depth shown, such as their eyes being more inside their face, and their skin color having a greyish tint to it. The art style helps in adding more to its mystery genre, and it make it stand out more than the rest of the other anime in the lineup.Art: 8/10~{Animation}~Animation quality is also top-notch, which is to be expected from A-1 pictures. The animations are fluid and very organized. And the animations have a realistic feel to it, just like it’s art style, therefore the two perfectly blend together to create a unique presentation. As a more of a different anime for A-1 Pictures to do, they managers to be consistently good with the animation quality of this anime. Though some of the CG usage can feel weird at times, specifically at the movement of vehicles, but overall it isn’t anything too bad. Also it’s rotoscoped OP is pretty cool, as rotoscoping was done properly there.Animation: 8/10~{Voice Acting}~The main cast of the anime is voice acted by, well, pretty unknown seiyuu. Kase Yasuyuki does Saikawa well, even though he is unexperienced with doing main character roles. However he is able to give a more mature feel to Saikawa pretty effectively. Tanezaki Atsumi does Nishinosono pretty well to, and gives the character a decent range of tone depending on the situation. At first I thought Hanazawa Kana did Nishinosono, because Tanezaki does almost just like her in this anime. Kido Ibuki does Magata Shiki, which happens to be a totally unique role for her as she mostly did jolly type of characters. She manages to do well with Magata, giving the character a solemn and mysterious tone, and bring the character to life. Some popular seiyuu such as Horie Yui and Hikasa Yoko also have a role in this anime, but it’s barely there to notice that they were part of it at all. Overall, the main cast does a decent job with the voice acting.Voice Acting: 7.5/10~{Music}~The opening of this anime really reminds me of Death Parade, because the tone of the OP is different from the tone of the anime. The OP “talking” is quite catchy and ended up being one of my favorite OP of the season. And the rotoscoped presentation of the OP really looks good. The Ending is really good to, and I’m not quite sure if it’s matches the tone of the anime or not. The ED “Nana Hitsuji” is really good to listen too. However the overall OST and background music is okay. The background music rarely adds to the suspense of the anime, if it’s there that is. For most of the time, the anime lacks background music. At times it works, at time it doesn’t, especially when some scenes crave for some background music to add suspense. Even if the OST is a mixed bad, at least the OP and ED is fantastic.Music: 7/10~{Enjoyment}~The anime would have been a lot better if the pacing was better. Most of the episodes, I started losing interest, and It made me check the time over and over again. And some of the dialogue in the anime is there just for the sake of dragging this anime, rather than actually adding something. However this is such a shame, especially since the plot and characters are great, and those the major reasons why the anime can still be considered good. If only the pacing would have been better, this anime could have been so, so, so much more. This would have worked more if this was a movie rather than a series.Enjoyment: 6/10In the end The Perfect Insider is worth checking out for its story and characters and it’s delivery in suspense and mystery. The pacing and some unnecessary pacing does pull the anime down to a place where it doesn’t deserve to be. Its lack of background music at times also is disappointing as background music in a mystery anime can do a lot more to the content. It’s sad to such great content be pulled down by some major flaws, but in the end, The Perfect Insider has some great plus points that makes it a good anime.+ Great plot and storyline and plot twists feel just right.+ Interesting cast of characters and their interactions with one another is top-notch.+ Unique art style and animation.+ The OP and ED are great.- Terrible pacing at times with some dialogues leading up to nowhere.- Lack of background music at times and OST isn’t anything special.Overall: 7.3/10 to be good, but is it?~{Story}~The story is about a professor, Saikawa, and his mentor’s daughter, Nishinosono, travel to an island to meet Magata, an intelligent programmer and an idol to Saikawa.

I mean, you could watch it for the mystery (which is also very intriguing mind you) but it\'s biggest theme is on the meaning of freedom so pick and chose.The mystery itself is very well done. It spends a good bulk of the series trying to figure out how the mystery was completed as well as the why. It was kind of frustrating though when Saikawa says he\'s found out...the mystery half way through the series but doesn\'t tell you since you are on the same side as Nishinosono, who\'s trying to figure out the mystery for herself (but never does and the solution ends up getting explained by Saikawa in the second to last episode anyway). Each episodes does a good job in setting up for the next one, and curiosity will get the better of you and force you to watch the whole series just to figure out how this act was committed.If you like philosophy, the series is also a good watch. The characters are thoughtful characters (Well two of them are) who think about the meaning of a lot of things. You also get a good look at the thought process of Magata Shiki, who is the main focus of the series. I actually still can\'t decide whether Magata is delusional or a genius, but she certainly as an interesting way at viewing life. Saikawa is the more down to earth version of Magata who makes Magata\'s thought process a bit easier to understand. All in all, her view of the world and on life and death is kind of insane but also makes a sort of sense. I can see where she came from even if it\'s completely insane in your head. I wish I could voice the sentiment a bit more eloquently but I don\'t think I can so I recommend you watch the anime and come up with your own answer and opinion about Magata Shiki.It was a great watch and each episode got me wanting more. The story isn\'t cliche at all despite the mystery being the great ""locked room"" case. I mean, my brain hurt a bit trying to organize and process all the information into my head, but all in all, it was a great series! You just have to think a lot while watching it.

Heh.', ""It's hard to explain exactly why I gave this anime 3 stars without giving away spoilers, so this is going to be a pretty short review. The show starts quite promisingly. A professor and the orphaned daughter (who drives a GORGEOUS Alfa Romeo) of the former head of the university at which the aforementioned prof works travel to the lab of a legendary genius programmer, famous for having murdered her parents at age 15 and for having locked herself in a single room at the lab ever since. The murder mystery is introduced almost right away, in very dramatic fashion, and the protagonists spend the...rest of the show trying to solve it. The biggest problem with the show is that I, a person of very average intelligence, was able to figure out who was behind the murder, if not exactly how the murder played out, very shortly after it happened, while it took the supposed Mensa IQ professor and rich girl ten more episodes. Ten more episodes full of nothing but Mensa IQ chainsmoking prof spouting reams of pseudoprofound bullshit and rich girl getting violently jealous every time another girl dares to exist within a 10-mile radius of him, while you are bombarded with hints the size of the moon as to who was behind the murder. Rather than coming to a climax, the show fizzles out around the middle of the tenth episode as the protagonists come to conclusions the viewer never could have reached because there were no hints leading up to them, and Magata and edgelord prof finally reach their personal Nirvana, where they can spout pseudointellectual bullshit at each other to their hearts' content. The art is unmemorable, the characters even less so, and the story - it could have and should have been told in an hour, tops. No-one goes anywhere or does anything of note aside from, as I said above, filling the air with philosophical-sounding word salad. If you think vaguely edgy, perpetually bored middle-aged chainsmokers with all the intuition of a concrete block droning on and on about how they're too smart for this world is deep and profound, this is the show for you.

If not, you would probably be better off watching something else."", 'I hope you will find this review short & succinct, while still informative. I\'ll spend most of my review on the story and characters.STORY:I quite enjoyed the first 4-5 episodes. These episodes hooked me by setting up what seemed to be a well-thought out mystery; they introduce an intriguing yet questionable relationship between two of the main protagonists; and discussions regarding Computer Science (CS) were relatively believable and without any blatant misuse of jargon.Unfortunately the mystery element stagnates and is quickly replaced by philosophical ramblings and unconvincing attempts at character development, all dressed up as Saikama\'s genius slowly whittling away at the mystery....It\'s not enjoyable to watch Saikama piece together the mystery while viewers are left ignorant of his revelations, instead having to sit through Nishinoso\'s attempts at getting his attention.CHARACTERS:Speaking of Nishinoso she too quickly becomes one-dimensional. Rather than moving the plot forward she exists only to hinder it. Her role is to pine after Saikama, assuring him she\'ll eventually catch up to him and figure out everything on her own. Saikama\'s responses are ambiguous; we\'re never sure if he\'s completely oblivious or just silently accepting her affection as a big-brother type (with both possibilities having been hinted at.) There\'s effectively no character development, and the only attempt at exploring their relationship exists as a short flashback. As for the other characters: both non-essential side characters and the main antagonist(s?) are lacking exposition and never really given the attention they deserved.ART:It\'s animated very well, although there\'s nothing particularly flashy in terms of color or scenery. I would describe it as solid and believable, but nothing to write home about. The most aesthetically pleasing bit of art in the show might actually be the ED.SOUND:ENGRISH. ENGRISH, SO BAD. EARS, THEY BLEED. In all fairness this is only one scene, but it draws on far too long and the rest of the sound is not very memorable. The OP and ED music were worth a listen ... one was rather catchy, but neither will end up on my playlists.ENJOYMENT:As noted in the discussion on story and characters, I enjoyed the early episodes, but as the story continued it became harder and harder to sit through. I was relieved when it was time for the big reveal, and while the explanation pleased my internal CS nerd it came far from satisfying my curiosity. There were a number of unanswered questions that were shrugged off with [paraphrasing] ""We may never know,"" or just completely ignored. I\'m left frustrated and wanting an English translation of the source work, since it\'s hard to imagine that such a half-baked mystery came out of an award-winning novel.OVERALL:If you like mysteries you might be interested at first, but this mystery will leave you questioning both the story and your decision to engage in it. If you can read Japanese I\'d wager you\'re much better off reading the book. It\'s not enjoyable to watch Saikama piece together the mystery while viewers are left ignorant of his revelations, instead having to sit through Nishinoso\'s attempts at getting his attention.CHARACTERS:Speaking of Nishinoso she too quickly becomes one-dimensional.

At first the story seems like an interesting mystery set out to be solved by a genius teacher and his moe pupil, oh wait, it's her name that's Moe. Why? Anyway the characters are pretty bland. You have the genius teacher who wants to use logic and unintentionally makes everyone feel like an idiot. Then the student who's in love with said teacher for some reason. The most interesting character is the mysterious unaging Dr. Magata, who is another genius in coding and other unexplained programming. Seriously, the don't explain what she really does in the...slightest. The problem is, once you get dialogue out of her, it's ambiguous statements about how life is a disease and death is the natural state of being. In the end the mystery is solved thanks to things no one would really figure out due to all information being processed mostly under unforeseen circumstances. The music and art is pretty good, but for the most part, everything else is pretty bland.

I believe that the story starts a little bit different that your usual animation, meaning that from episode one your stuck with a slow paced work.

So give it time and enjoy the characters ""thinking out loud"" attitude that is rarely seen.Probably the most fun or entertaining part of Subete ga F ni Naru is giving yourself enough time to...come up with your own theories on many of the clues regarding the murders, only to get even more exited when reaching the end and seeing the big plot twist that broke the internet (or the part that is interested in this type of content) when this was being broadcast.However, if your thirst for mystery isn\'t quenched then I suggest you search for the rest of the S&M series (S&M stands for Saikawa and Moe) or maybe take an interest in the live-action in which you\'ll be treated for more content regarding the protagonists of this anime. come up with your own theories on many of the clues regarding the murders, only to get even more exited when reaching the end and seeing the big plot twist that broke the internet (or the part that is interested in this type of content) when this was being broadcast.However, if your thirst for mystery isn\'t quenched then I suggest you search for the rest of the S&M series (S&M stands for Saikawa and Moe) or maybe take an interest in the live-action in which you\'ll be treated for more content regarding the protagonists of this anime.', ""This anime is really smart at making twitst. every twist that they made was really amazing to me. always got me well.*StoryThe story was kinda weird and confusing in the beginning but the way they revealed everything was great. i think i got mind blows by this show many times too. the story and the plot was so tricky and mind blowing like No Game No Life(If you ever watch it) and i think this one is one of my favorite after No game no life. the first episode felt mysterious and chilling too, felt like something big will happen in the next and...next episode so because of curiousty, i continue to watch it. it turned out to be so good to me. and i almost forgot to say that the twist was involving computer program, so it was kinda hard to understand for someone who don't really know computer program thing. And not only computer program, they even used math to revealed the mystery. tbh i really like the way they revealed the mystery. So from overall story, i think the plot can be enjoyable to eveyone that understand it. it was tricky and msytery plot, that the only word that i can describe from the plot. 9/10*Arti don't really know what to say to the animation or the art. it wasn't terrible and not bad too. just, okay...... it was not like i got bored because of the animation, i enjoy it, but still overall the animation is meh.... to me. instead of a good character design, sometimes the character design became a scary character design to me. 7/10*SoundObviously i really like the sountrack, especially the OP and the ED. so fitting the show. i felt like the OP and the ED were the one who made this show more better. the soundtrack in the show was good i guess. but when it got into a scary scene, the soundtrack changed into a scary ones too, that was so chilling to me. 9/10*CharacterThe character was so unique. never seen a character like that before. the teacher, Moe and Magata. Moe personality isn't something that i never seen though, but the Teacher(Souhei) and Magata was indeed so unique. but Magata is unique in a bad way. i don't want to show any spoiler so you will understand what i mean if you watch it. the way they were thinking was too unique to me and tbh i like the way they thinking too. i think from the overall character i will give it 8/10 because Souhei and Magata were the only persone that i think is unique.*EnjoymentObviously i enjoy it so much. it was a good show to watch and worth to watch, even thought it was so difficult to understand. and with mystery show, they obviously in a few episode they ended it with a cliffhanger and it made me curious more about what will happen next. 9/10From overall score i give it 9/10. the reason is just because i enjoy the show. the animation wasn't something spectacular but the other looked great too me.Hope this review can be helpful for you.Sorry for bad english, and....Thanks :D next episode so because of curiousty, i continue to watch it. it turned out to be so good to me. and i almost forgot to say that the twist was involving computer program, so it was kinda hard to understand for someone who don't really know computer program thing.

As one of the most polarising shows I've seen, many people either love it or hate it based on the first episode, with that opinion not usually standing through the whole series. I personally like the show a lot, but I will dread defending it as its a pretty surreal and not always comfortable experience.Subete ga F ni Naru is a mystery anime centred around Magata Shiki, a genius programmer trapped in a research facility. Our main protagonists are...two quirky characters, a rich arrogant young lady by the name of Nishinosono Moe and a dry but smart professor, Saikawa Souhei, two quirky yet ordinary people who get caught up in something shocking that happens within the facility.That does sound pretty standard, with the mystery genre having been done time and again across various TV anime and serial drama. However, I strangely find that the series's strongest point is in its uniqueness, its first episode already demonstrates one of the series' main quirks: copious amount of talking. Not even detective stuff, a lot of it is the dry talking as you would see in our daily lives. It might get boring for people who want some action, but it fleshes out each character's quirks really well in a unique manner.The show does have a long length for its main plot of a single mystery, with extra time spent on fleshing out its characters, the interplay between Moe and Souhei being the main highlight of the show. The two of them have intense debates and its a joy seeing them play off one another. This character focused approach was to me a really interesting direction for a mystery story to take and one of my favourite parts of the show.I also liked how the show avoided a lot of the main pitfalls of the mystery genre, there were no illogical coincidences and the things that did not make sense were at least pretty unpredictable. There were no cheats or details hidden from the audience either, pretty refreshing for a mystery series.The execution of the show is excellent, with a masterful soundtrack alongside dramatic camera angles and set pieces, making it really easy to get absorbed into its atmosphere. You will see vibrant and colourful scenery, cold and futuristic research facilities, even vast and otherworldly oceans. Each set piece is filled with the personality of the person inhabiting, making what is going on screen feel more natural. Especially notable is the contrast of the show, because of how mundane the things on screen sometimes look, the poignant moments really stand out with its surreal art design impressing the viewer.Subete ga F ni Naru is a breath of fresh air blowing into this anime scene littered with tropes. Fearlessly being unconventional, it stands as an example of a series that has some actual meaning to its surreality, not just randomness for its own sake, and I hope we get to see more series like it in future. two quirky characters, a rich arrogant young lady by the name of Nishinosono Moe and a dry but smart professor, Saikawa Souhei, two quirky yet ordinary people who get caught up in something shocking that happens within the facility.That does sound pretty standard, with the mystery genre having been done time and again across various TV anime and serial drama.

SPOILER FREE for your enjoyment.PROS:+ Pleasant, detailed animation; an interesting and fitting color scheme.+ Enjoyable sound track, with a great OP and ED+ Nice voice actingCONS:- ""Mystery"" is predictable (At least for someone who has watched a lot of TV. By episode 5 it was pretty clear to me, yet it takes a VERY SLOW five episodes more for the characters to put it together).- Little characterization leads to one-dimensional characters (i.e., the ""young and in love,"" the ""suave man of intellect,"" the ""unfeeling genius,"" etc.)- Slow plot progression...(I normally don\'t mind this; many murder mysteries seem slow as you gather the details that lead to the big reveal or twist, but even taking this into account, Perfect Insider lagged too much)OVERALL:If you\'re a fan of mysteries and don\'t mind a slow plot, give it a go. Because it\'s only 11 episodes, it doesn\'t take much time to complete. (But if, by episode 5, you think you have everything figured out, you\'re probably right.)

Although the answer is clear from the beginning in mystery genre anime, there were parts of it that I did not understand until the end. Although the explanations of the crime come quickly, you can understand better by reading the comments. I liked the philosophy and thought of the character we call ""villain"". People generally thought it was psychopathic and ridiculous. However, I think the professor and the criminal character were very well written characters. On the other hand, I felt like there was a forced romance, the main character girl was very...annoying. Although it reminds me of the main character in psycho-pass, I think this girl\'s behaviours were more disturbing.Btw, you can also find meaningful quotes.It\'s only 11 eps so its worth watching. annoying.

Everything about it enchanted me from the very beginning; from the main character, Nishinosono, to the mystery lurking at the core of it all, to the eerie feel that the whole series has. You'll remain in awe of the characters' sheer mental brilliance from the beginning to the end, and you'll come to understand Nishinosono more than you understand yourself. The show makes it so very clear to its audience what the motivations of each character are, in its own time. If you're confused, just keep watching: everything will be revealed eventually, and what isn't is barely enough to tantalize...you.It is, I believe, a psychological horror, and if you like that genre, you can't go wrong with Subete ga F ni Naru.

Beware of some blood, though."", 'After passing it over at least half a dozen times while deciding which anime to watch, my wife and I finally gave The Perfect Insider a go and if nothing else it was certainly unique and didn\'t feel overly like any other anime we\'ve seen. At just 11 episodes it\'s a fast, approachable program, though it somehow manages to feel like it doesn\'t truly even have enough content to fill that very short run time, and it certainly loses steam towards the end as well, leaving us with an overall mixed bag that I\'ll now discuss with a bit more detail.From the very beginning the...program treads the fine line of delving into philosophical territory and staying focused on the matter at hand. It repeatedly asks questions along the lines of ""What is the meaning of true freedom?"" and ""What does it mean to be alive?"", which isn\'t my cup of tea to begin with, but for most of the show it sprinkles this in just enough to where it isn\'t obnoxious. Towards the end, however, it starts laying it on a little thicker. Between the push towards the philosophical and the ""multiple personalities"" plot point, I suppose the anime this reminds me the most of, though they\'re still largely different entities, is The Garden of Sinners.The core of the show, and the part that will keep the viewer engaged, is the murder mystery we\'re trying to solve. How satisfying a mystery program is really lives and dies by how good or not good its resolution is and in this case I\'d say it\'s mediocre. This plot in its entirety relies on the all too common and all too convenient anime trope in which there is a character who is not only a genius, but in fact so, so, so much smarter than everyone else that they\'re able to meticulously plan things out years in advance, make zero mistakes in doing so, execute them perfectly and have no one around them catch on to any of it. The events of the show are technically possible, but they really, really stretch plausibility to the max.While the viewer MAY be able to solve the ""Who is the culprit?"" part of the mystery, it\'s basically impossible to solve the code presented early on in the show. No one watching this is going to figure out what ""Everything becomes F"" means without looking it up. It gets into hexadecimals and is super esoteric and thus feels cheap in that we\'re presented with a mystery that we cannot realistically solve. I found the answer to this to be more of an eye roll than anything else because there was no chance in hell, even if I were given five years to do nothing but sit there and think about it, I\'d be able to come up with the correct answer and I feel quite safe in assuming the same would be true for damn near every single other viewer.Presentation wise, they nailed it. The anime looks good, sounds good and while this was never dubbed, the subtitles I watched on the blu ray release were seemingly perfect. I didn\'t notice a single mistake! My wife really liked both the opening and ending songs as well.The overall pacing is fine. It\'s only 11 episodes so it\'s not going to have long stretches of nothingness, but we do still see a few flashback scenes repeatedly and they start to get old and the last episode in particular is a total snoozefest. The ""real ending"" is in episode 10. The 11th and final episode almost feels unnecessary, but it certainly isn\'t exciting at all one way or another. I am confident they could have cut this down to 10 episodes with a few small edits, really reinforcing that there isn\'t a whole lot of meat on the bone, even if what is there is reasonably good.Overall I enjoyed The Perfect Insider enough to not regret watching it, though I definitely liked the first half more than the second, and there\'s little reason to ever watch this a second time once you know the resolution. At just 11 episodes it\'s a short enough ride to easily be binged in a day or two, so it wouldn\'t be a huge waste of anyone\'s time if you were to give it a go and ultimately didn\'t like it. Worth one watch? Maybe. Something you\'d be ""missing out"" on if you passed over it? Nope.

It touches on some rather sensitive and disturbing romance and sex themes, as well as exploring the workings of the human mind in a more philosophical sense.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 8/10-----------------------------------------------The setting of the show really doesn't leave much room for art or animation to shine, but for this type of show, it looks perfectly acceptable. The character designs and detail is solid, environments sufficiently detailed, and animations clear enough to get emotions across.Sound / Music / Voice Acting -...9/10------------------------------------------Some beautiful classical pieces and top notch voice acting make the show pleasing to the ears. It doesn't overdo with fancy music tracks of effects. Extra credit is given to the two VA's who portray a several minute long dialogue in English, despite being obvious Japanese natives. Their English is heavily accented but clear and easy to understand, and surprisingly adds another layer of complexity to the show's mystery plot.Story - 8/10-------------Subete ga F ni Naru has a peculiar story with no clear beginning nor end. The mystery the show revolves around is interesting, but it serves more of a plot device for the gathering of the main characters, and the exploration of their thoughts, feelings, and other philosophical contemplations.The mystery itself isn't overly deep, though solving it fully as a viewer is quite difficult. Still, it's possible to figure out the gist of it well ahead of the eventual revelations.The greater part of the story is in truth the relationships between the main characters. The main characters are extreme intellectuals who view the world very much differently from regular people, but also from each-other due to how their particular style of intellect functions. The notable age gap further complicates things, as does their attachment and interest in the mystery. There's an awkward, even sensitive or disturbing romance and sex theme, depending on how you look at it. If the topics of potential grooming and underage sex disturb you, then you might want to avoid the show as these themes have a central importance.As a whole, the story is perfectly happy to leave us viewers in a state of contemplation as to what actually happened, who is right, and who is wrong. To some, this will be a big negative, to others, it will be an enjoyable mental exercise and a chance at some introspection.Characters - 8/10---------------------Saikawa, Souhei is an extremely intelligent university professor who cannot help but to feel restrained by the world around him. Struggling to relate to most people around him, he spends his free time philosophising about various topics relating to the human mind and existence, while dreaming of meeting one of the greatest intellectual minds in the world.Nishinosono, Moe is a young but extremely intelligent college student who is enamoured with professor Saikawa and spends much of her free time visiting him in his office, looking to grow closer to him and break through his peculiar barriers created by his unique type of intelligence.Magata, Shiki is considered the greatest intellectual mind on the planet. Having apparently killed her parents at the age of 14, and then spent the next 15 years in an isolated island doing research, her motivations remain a mystery. Her character is hard to get a handle on, and delving somewhat deeper into her psyche through-out the show is a fun process.There are also numerous secondary characters that help fill the screen time, but as a whole the story focuses on these three individuals and how their personalities and intellects interact.It is fun, though at times confusing.---Total - 8/10---Subete ga F ni Naru is an interesting anime that doesn't really dazzle with anything up front, but does make you want to think along. The mystery is fun, but the character relations and deeper concepts of the human mind and the very human existence might be even more so.At the same time, some of the romance and sex themes might be too much for some people to enjoy, though it does serve a purpose in the story, and further adds topics of discussion to think about.As a whole it's a fun watch for those looking for something more cerebral than the average anime. 9/10------------------------------------------Some beautiful classical pieces and top notch voice acting make the show pleasing to the ears.

O crime ocorreu no laboratório da Magata, um local onde ninguém pode entrar ou sair, situado em uma ilha remota que não havia contato nenhum com o exterior, tornando este um crime de quarto fechado. Com o Saikawa e a Nishinosono estando presentes no momento onde o corpo de Magata Shiki foi descoberto, eles não só se tornam testemunhas como passam a tentar desvendar o...mistério por conta própria.O mistério de Subete ga F ni Naru pode ser dividido em duas vertentes que no fim irão se encontrar, quem é o assassino e como foi efetuado o assassinato. Apesar de aparentarem ser questões próximas uma da outra e que seriam resolvidas ao mesmo tempo, a obra deixa bem claro que as informações necessárias para alcançar a resposta de cada pergunta não estavam relacionadas, tanto que são trabalhadas em um espaço-tempo diferente. As cenas constantes que retratavam o passado da Magata com seu tio se mostraram o ponto chave para a descoberta de quem era o assassinato, já as pesquisas feitas pelo Saikawa e a Nishinosono são essenciais para entender como foi realizado o crime.A obra possui êxito ao não entregar as informações de mão beijada, o Saikawa até chega a brincar de que não gostava de diálogos expositivos, os dados necessários para descobrir quem era o assassino são entregues em sua maioria logo no quarto episódio, onde a câmera mostra a existência de duas cadeiras, um bicho de pelúcia e os blocos de montar que haviam no laboratório da Magata. Juntando esses itens com o passado da Magata que havia sido mostrado, era possível chegar a conclusão, algo que fica ainda mais claro no insight tido pelo Saikawa, onde de forma sutil sem se utilizar de nenhuma palavra, em meio a todos os avestruzes correndo era visto diversas pessoas grávidas, chegando assim a conclusão da existência da filha da Magata.A outra questão é resolvida majoritariamente pelo Saikawa e seus conhecimentos de informática, conseguindo decifrar que o F da frase que da nome ao anime, se referia ao código hexadecimal programado com antecedência para atrasar o relógio em um minuto e em determinado momento cortar a luz por um breve período. Com a observação da Nishinosono percebendo que o elevador estava subindo durante o primeiro apagão, onde a Magata saiu do quarto vestida de branco é compreendida a forma como o assassinato do diretor ocorreu.Entretanto essa questão possui alguns problemas, as grandes dicas para a resolução dela é a frase ""Tudo se tornará F"", a sexta versão do Red Magic estar pronta, mas o laboratório ainda utilizar a versão quatro e o elevador subindo durante a descoberta do corpo da Magata. Apesar de existirem outras informações importantes, elas se relacionam de alguma forma com as três citadas anteriormente. No caso do elevador, ele estar funcionando é uma informação omitida para o espectador em primeiro momento, fazendo com que tenha conhecimento do fato junto com os personagens, o que é um ponto positivo, coloca todos em pé de igualdade na hora de resolver o mistério, porém o espectador tem acesso ao passado da Magata e por isso a conclusão do caso funciona, o espectador alterna entre nivelar seu conhecimento ao dos personagens e ser onisciente, de forma que essa onisciência possa ser vista como um apoio para o mistério funcionar, algo fundamental, que sem ele pontas ficariam soltas e as peças não se encaixariam.O problema envolvendo a frase e do Red Magic acabam por ser o mesmo, afinal ambos estão relacionados a tecnologia. A frase ""Tudo se tornará F"" no fim está se referindo a linguagem hexadecimal presente nos computadores onde para o 15 não possuir dois dígitos é substituído pela letra F, o problema aqui não é precisar de um conhecimento prévio por parte do espectador, mas sim, a obra não dar ênfase suficiente à tecnologia. O maior aparecimento do tema foi no primeiro episódio onde o Saikawa precisa consertar um computador, obviamente aparelhos tecnológicos aparecem com frequência no laboratório, mas não funcionam como uma preparação para o tópico da linguagem hexadecimal ou quando funcionam são ofuscados.Subete ga F ni Naru começa com uma passagem filosófica da Magata, um pensamento existencialista se questionando sobre a restrição de liberdade que a vida dava, em seguida o Saikawa e a Nishinosono vão ser apresentados, tendo também uma conversa sobre liberdade e o significado da vida. Existe uma premissa filosófica muito forte na obra, e funciona muito bem em momentos como quando a Nishinosono percebe que Saikawa ficou do lado quando precisou, mas essa mesma premissa atrapalha a obra quando se junta com a múltipla personalidade da Magata. Isoladamente ambas as ideias funcionam, mas juntas tiram o foco daquilo que realmente é importante, a tecnologia, afinal aquilo que de fato vai ser utilizado para a compreensão do mistério é ela. As múltiplas personalidades funcionam como um chamariz que tem como função desviar o olhar do espectador, mas devido ao impacto causado pelas passagens filosóficas não só atrai o olhar, como também rouba os holofotes.O mistério de Subete ga F ni Naru possui uma base muito sólida, se pegar ele e desmanchar em uma mesa, ligando todas as informações com o que elas geram e contribuem para o resultado final, tal fato ficará muito claro, tanto que a experiência de participar como um terceiro detetive pode ser muito prazerosa. Por outro lado temos as passagens filosóficas que apesar de entregar reflexões muito boas e importantes para o roteiro, acabam por roubar o espaço daquilo que é tão importante quanto ela. A obra em si é muito bem estruturada, faltou apenas um pouco de carinho na produção, um pouco mais de impacto em determinadas cenas para assim, extrair o potencial total da obra.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Text in english (Translated by google translator, there may be errors)Subete ga F ni Naru tells the story of how Saikawa Souhei and Nishinosono Moe became involved in the murder of Magata Shiki, a great researcher known as the only one worthy of receiving the title of genius. The crime took place in the Magata laboratory, a place where no one can enter or leave, located on a remote island that had no contact with the outside world, making this a closed-room crime. With Saikawa and Nishinosono being present at the moment Magata Shiki\'s body was discovered, they not only become witnesses but also try to unravel the mystery on their own.The mystery of Subete ga F ni Naru can be divided into two strands that will meet in the end, who is the murderer and how the murder was carried out. Although they appear to be questions close to each other and that would be solved at the same time, the work makes it clear that the information needed to reach the answer to each question was not related, so much so that they are worked on in a different space-time. The constant scenes that portrayed Magata\'s past with her uncle proved to be the key point for discovering who the murder was, since the research done by Saikawa and Nishinosono are essential to understand how the crime was carried out.The work is successful in not handing over the information, Saikawa even joked that he didn\'t like expository dialogues, the data needed to find out who the killer was is delivered in the majority right in the fourth episode, where the camera shows the existence of two chairs, a stuffed animal and the building blocks that were in Magata\'s laboratory. Putting these items together with Magata\'s past that had been shown, it was possible to reach a conclusion, something that is even clearer in the insight given by Saikawa, where in a subtle way without using any words, amidst all the ostriches running it was seen several pregnant people, thus reaching the conclusion of the existence of Magata\'s daughter.The other issue is mostly resolved by Saikawa and his computer skills, managing to decipher that the F in the phrase that gives the anime its name, referred to the hexadecimal code programmed in advance to delay the clock by one minute and at a certain moment cut the light for a brief period. With the observation of Nishinosono realizing that the elevator was going up during the first blackout, where Magata came out of the room dressed in white, it is understood how the director\'s murder occurred.However, this question has some problems, the big hints for solving it are the phrase ""Everything will become F"", the sixth version of Red Magic is ready, but the laboratory still uses version four and the elevator going up during the discovery of the body from Magata. Although there are other important pieces of information, they are somehow related to the three mentioned above. In the case of the elevator, it being working is information omitted for the viewer at first, making him aware of the fact along with the characters, which is a positive point, it puts everyone on an equal footing when it comes to solving the mystery. , but the viewer has access to Magata\'s past and that\'s why the conclusion of the case works, the viewer alternates between leveling his knowledge with that of the characters and being omniscient, so that this omniscience can be seen as a support for the mystery to work, something fundamental, that without it the ends would be loose and the pieces would not fit together.The problem involving the phrase and Red Magic turn out to be the same, after all both are related to technology. The phrase ""Everything will become F"" at the end is referring to the hexadecimal language present in computers where, for 15 not to have two digits, it is replaced by the letter F, the problem here is not that the spectator needs prior knowledge, but , the work does not put enough emphasis on technology. The biggest appearance of the theme was in the first episode where Saikawa needs to fix a computer, obviously technological devices appear frequently in the laboratory, but they do not work as a preparation for the hexadecimal language topic or when they work they are obfuscated.Subete ga F ni Naru begins with a philosophical passage from Magata, an existentialist thought questioning itself about the restriction of freedom that life gave, then Saikawa and Nishinosono will be introduced, also having a conversation about freedom and the meaning of life . There is a very strong philosophical premise in the work, and it works very well in moments like when Nishinosono realizes that Saikawa stayed by her side when she needed it, but that same premise hinders the work when combined with Magata\'s multiple personality. Isolated, both ideas work, but together they take the focus away from what is really important, technology, after all, what will actually be used to understand the mystery is technology. The multiple personalities act as a decoy whose function is to divert the viewer\'s gaze, but due to the impact caused by the philosophical passages, it not only attracts the eye, but also steals the spotlight.The mystery of Subete ga F ni Naru has a very solid base, if you take it and break it down on a table, connecting all the information with what they generate and contribute to the final result, this fact will become very clear, so much so that the experience of participating as a third detective can be very enjoyable. On the other hand, we have the philosophical passages that, despite delivering very good and important reflections for the script, end up stealing space from what is as important as it is. The work itself is very well structured, it just lacked a little affection in the production, a little more impact in certain scenes in order to extract the full potential of the work. mistério por conta própria.O mistério de Subete ga F ni Naru pode ser dividido em duas vertentes que no fim irão se encontrar, quem é o assassino e como foi efetuado o assassinato. Apesar de aparentarem ser questões próximas uma da outra e que seriam resolvidas ao mesmo tempo, a obra deixa bem claro que as informações necessárias para alcançar a resposta de cada pergunta não estavam relacionadas, tanto que são trabalhadas em um espaço-tempo diferente. As cenas constantes que retratavam o passado da Magata com seu tio se mostraram o ponto chave para a descoberta de quem era o assassinato, já as pesquisas feitas pelo Saikawa e a Nishinosono são essenciais para entender como foi realizado o crime.A obra possui êxito ao não entregar as informações de mão beijada, o Saikawa até chega a brincar de que não gostava de diálogos expositivos, os dados necessários para descobrir quem era o assassino são entregues em sua maioria logo no quarto episódio, onde a câmera mostra a existência de duas cadeiras, um bicho de pelúcia e os blocos de montar que haviam no laboratório da Magata. Juntando esses itens com o passado da Magata que havia sido mostrado, era possível chegar a conclusão, algo que fica ainda mais claro no insight tido pelo Saikawa, onde de forma sutil sem se utilizar de nenhuma palavra, em meio a todos os avestruzes correndo era visto diversas pessoas grávidas, chegando assim a conclusão da existência da filha da Magata.A outra questão é resolvida majoritariamente pelo Saikawa e seus conhecimentos de informática, conseguindo decifrar que o F da frase que da nome ao anime, se referia ao código hexadecimal programado com antecedência para atrasar o relógio em um minuto e em determinado momento cortar a luz por um breve período. Com a observação da Nishinosono percebendo que o elevador estava subindo durante o primeiro apagão, onde a Magata saiu do quarto vestida de branco é compreendida a forma como o assassinato do diretor ocorreu.Entretanto essa questão possui alguns problemas, as grandes dicas para a resolução dela é a frase ""Tudo se tornará F"", a sexta versão do Red Magic estar pronta, mas o laboratório ainda utilizar a versão quatro e o elevador subindo durante a descoberta do corpo da Magata. Apesar de existirem outras informações importantes, elas se relacionam de alguma forma com as três citadas anteriormente. No caso do elevador, ele estar funcionando é uma informação omitida para o espectador em primeiro momento, fazendo com que tenha conhecimento do fato junto com os personagens, o que é um ponto positivo, coloca todos em pé de igualdade na hora de resolver o mistério, porém o espectador tem acesso ao passado da Magata e por isso a conclusão do caso funciona, o espectador alterna entre nivelar seu conhecimento ao dos personagens e ser onisciente, de forma que essa onisciência possa ser vista como um apoio para o mistério funcionar, algo fundamental, que sem ele pontas ficariam soltas e as peças não se encaixariam.O problema envolvendo a frase e do Red Magic acabam por ser o mesmo, afinal ambos estão relacionados a tecnologia.

To go through the burden of human existence?"" The artwork wasn\'t great and I\'m happy it wasn\'t or else it may have taken the attention away from the story. But maybe better artwork could\'ve attracted a larger...audience who knows, I\'m no artist. But overall most people who will or are critical of the anime haven\'t seen past episodes 1 or 2.

It keeps you guessing throughout and has a good suspense element. It's one of the better and more unique locked room mysteries that I've come across, It's just extremely dark and creepy and tries to get you hooked early on. Through 11 episodes it...manages to tell a good cohesive story through some smart characterization, The way they tackle the mystery is really good, They take an extremely logical approach to solving the case and that is one of the biggest strengths of the anime. The Sci-Fi part of this show I truly appreciate, mainly because the source material for this anime is a 1996 novel by Hiroshi Mori, The fact that he wrote it then and it's still so modern and relevant is a great thing and it also plays well into constructing the mystery and symbolically painting pictures.From a Technical aspect this is one of more Hipster anime I've seen in recent years, It's whole background design is very different, they use a lot of shapes and shit, Idk why but it looks great. The cinematography and camera are pleasantly weird, especially during conversations, it makes for a pretty noble experience, The characters are weird too, they aren't bound by any normal storytelling rules and as the mystery progresses it adds a lot of dimension to both the characters and the story. Another thing I love about this show is how they end each episode, It's always very strong and makes you want to immediately click the next episode. The music does a good job of complimenting the mystery and the eerie atmosphere, I love both the OP and ED, The OP is one of my all time favorites. The animation is consistent and strong throughout. No complaints here.Coming to the cons, While the show does a good job tackling the science and mystery in a very intelligent way, It at times fails in some of the more normal human aspects, Like maybe relationships or maybe the grief after a death or maybe when the killer is probably around you but you want to go bed. It's kinda frustrating because this is truly an amazing mystery, Even if you make a good prediction, it will still be interesting to see how it plays out. But Some things are just a little unbelievable and forced, So yeah, that's quite a knock on this show. It is also extremely talkative and preachy, which I don't mind but a lot of people might get bored easily, this surely isn't an anime for everyone.Overall, this is was a great anime, not one that's for everyone but that's why I would recommend it to everyone. There's only one way to find out and that's you watching it, Love it or hate it, this is a mystery that you just can't miss. If you can make it past the first couple of episodes and still hang around, you're in for a real treat.My Rating:- 8.25/10 manages to tell a good cohesive story through some smart characterization, The way they tackle the mystery is really good, They take an extremely logical approach to solving the case and that is one of the biggest strengths of the anime.

It felt like some episodes kept dragging on and on. Kys Don't get me wrong it did have some good suspense. It just lost my interest at some parts. A good point this anime deals with is morals.! Is it morally right to take a life for this? Etc. The last episode was a nice conclusion in my opinion though. 🙂 I loved how obviously they showed the difference between the characters morals and values though. I wish this anime dived in more with Saikawa's past like they did...with Moe. I think it would have let me enjoy this anime more, to know why he is who he is then and why he thinks his morals like he does. with Moe. I think it would have let me enjoy this anime more, to know why he is who he is then and why he thinks his morals like he does."", 'To me this anime has two big themes that are really well developed: it\'s a mystery story but it is also an existential story. Both of them are treated pretty good. What do I mean by that?: the mystery plot is not overly simple neither overly complicated, they show all the evidence you would need to create a theory that will lead you to solve the mystery as long as you keep your mind open. In that sense is a good mystery show, it\'s not easily predictable (which would make it dull) but neither overly complicated (which would make it ""unfair"" as the viewer might...not have all the elements to solve the mystery before or together with the characters).With respect to the existentialsm inherent to some of the characteres, this could be a more personal opinion, but the thoughts discussed in the show are really interesting and I felt identified with a lot of them: freedom, human nature, life and death, etc. big topics that are not shallowy discussed as the characteres seem really coherent: characteres with a complicated past, with complicated personalities, with complicated thoughts about life, with contradictions and overwhelming emotions... you know, like humans tend to be.I enjoyed the story a lot: I saw the whole show in one night (is very short so...) which means that it kept my interest and I wanted to know more about the story of the characteres and the resolution of the plot. This is pull out with only a few characters, which I think is very valuable (in some mystery anime they tend to include docens of characteres in the plot to confuse you and over complicate the argument).To me the whole business with the computer and the maths its mostly complementary, it\'s not the centre of discussion neither the base of the argument (I work with coding and stuff like that, there was nothing deep related to it), it was just a way to show the sadness and freedom desire of the characters, as to them the digital world is a ""perfect"" world, as the digital world lacks everything that makes the real world a world where you want to escape from, a world where you suffer because you are constrained.In summary, I highly recommend this anime to people that enjoys mystery plots and that also enjoys to contemplate exitentialist arguments that will keep you thinking for a few days later about these topics: some times I feel like I need another way to think about things, and the view this show presents is a very interesting one.

The Perfect Insider always played with weird philosophy, but it at least acknowledged that such philosophy was weird. The problem started right at the end of the show, just after the main mysteries (a little bit farfetched) were solved.It also didn’t help that the anime presented main characters that were a bit annoying as well. Souhei felt to be the know-it-all of the show, the one that knew everything about the world and...life, and a person who used such “knowledge” to make his own philosophy. Moe was a cocky little girl who just wanted to be noticed by her sensei. And Magata, well, we know about her at the end of the show, so there wasn’t so many problems with her. However, the first two grew with time, as well as their relationship, which turned out to be the best part of the show, and the best part of the finale. Aa Souhei was the main “detective”, he dropped his philosophical persona to be the one who explained the problems to us, something that helped him a lot to be more likeable. Moe grew a lot as well. Although she didn’t give up her love for her sensei, she stopped wanting to impress Souhei and tried to be an equal to him. And thanks to her backstory, we could understand why she was a bit obsessed with her.The mystery per se was understandable at the beginning, with some shocking twists right at the beginning of the anime, to great back story at the middle of it, with compelling development for Magata as well. But just by the end of the show, it went some way that didn’t quite worked out for me.The production values were nice. Animation and art were very interesting, especially during moments where our heroes enter a machine which materialized their thoughts, showing us some surreal and beautiful sceneries. The music was good as well, especially during the revelations and twists moments. The OP and the ED were really entertaining, being the former the one that stood out to me (watching our protagonists dancing is really amazing, especially Magata, who performs a ballet-like choreography which is simply beautiful).Overall, the show was entertaining and would be a nice gateway for newcomers to anime. Our main heroes grew up a lot during the 11 episodes. However, the mystery took twists that were too ridiculous, and the presence of almost nonsensical philosophy ruined everything by the end.

Although she didn’t give up her love for her sensei, she stopped wanting to impress Souhei and tried to be an equal to him. And thanks to her backstory, we could understand why she was a bit obsessed with her.The mystery per se was understandable at the beginning, with some shocking twists right at the beginning of the anime, to great back story at the middle of it, with compelling development for Magata as well. But just by the end of the show, it went some way that didn’t quite worked out for me.The production values were nice. Animation and art were very interesting, especially during moments where our heroes enter a machine which materialized their thoughts, showing us some surreal and beautiful sceneries. The music was good as well, especially during the revelations and twists moments. The OP and the ED were really entertaining, being the former the one that stood out to me (watching our protagonists dancing is really amazing, especially Magata, who performs a ballet-like choreography which is simply beautiful).Overall, the show was entertaining and would be a nice gateway for newcomers to anime. Our main heroes grew up a lot during the 11 episodes. However, the mystery took twists that were too ridiculous, and the presence of almost nonsensical philosophy ruined everything by the end. Not the best, but not the worst thing ever.', 'This journey was a mind blowing experience and a very refreshing mystery anime to see. As a fan of mystery genre of anime, I was delighted to finally find an anime which followed the archetype yet provide an out of this world story and experience.Story: 9/10This is the main attraction of this anime. Its story. Despite it having a slow start at the beginning and it being a very monotonous and boring anime at times, this is an anime about talking, as the opening suggests. The mystery is basically a locked room murder case, with no one entering the room for around 7 years already....It works very well as a mystery anime, as this is one of the most mind blowing locked room murder cases I have ever seen. To me, this mystery has used a commonly used murder mystery archetype and crafted it into something which is quite out of the box. And all this is done while having a side story of Magata Shiki at the end of the episode as well.Art: 6/10The art in this anime tends to be very dull, which makes it not as interesting. Due to them usually being indoors as well, they are constantly surrounded by grey walls which further makes it unappealing.  The characters are also designed a little weird, with majority of them having very pale and whitish looking faces.Sound: 6/10The anime does use background music from time to time in certain moments to provide atmosphere but does not utilize much in terms of background music as compared to other anime. Though it is more understandable as almost the entire show compromises of the characters talking on and on and on. One negative about he voice actors, especially Saikawa\'s is that they are very monotonous. This is a considerable downfall, especially when the main thing he does is talk. This makes the anime much more boring at several times.Characters: 6/10For this, there are only 3 main characters who we have to take note of. They are Saikawa sensei, Nishinosono Moe and Magata Shiki. With Magata being the most interesting of the lot to me. Saikawa and Nishinosono\'s relation ship is abasically her liking him and him friendzoning her. Their relation is also similar to that of a master is to a helper, with Saikawa figuring things out much quicker and much better than Nishinosono. Magata on the other hand is a professor who was the victim of a locked room murder. Magata is the character who is a genius and doesnt have any morals binding her. Saikawa is a slightly pretentious character at times who is interested in Magata in terms of how she thinks and such.Enjoyment: 9/10Personally, i enjoyed this very very much. As a person who enjoys mystery anime a lot, this one certainly did bring it to the table. There were a handful of plot twists here and there which made me go ""Woah"" a couple of times. Along with the right amount of information withheld and given to keep you at the edge of your seat. Even though there was that, most of the time, you would be listening to line after line of dialogue. During this time, one would either think about how the mystery would be solved or would be bored out of their minds.Overall: 8/10In short, this is a very nicely crafted piece of mystery. However, despite how captivating the entire story was, most other aspects of the anime tend to be lacking. It falls short in terms of making the anime more entertaining. This causes the person watching to be very easily bored while watching.Unless the story makes up for it. Which is what I feel has happened. This is a very intriguing mystery which was what I felt unpredictable. It was a wild ride and provided a story which I could not see coming at all.Overall, I give Subete ga F ni naru: The perfect insider a 8/10.I also apologize for my inability to express the mystery as I do not want to spoil anything.

Thanks for reading.', 'Ok, a proper review from me finally. Since my last one regarding this terrible show got taken down.-SPOILERS BELOW-This anime tries so very hard to be deep and psychological. In the least, it is not. This anime truly encompasses what someone who took psych 101 thinks psychology is....The anime\'s take on Disassociation Identity Disorder is at most... very insulting to real people who suffer. They make it seem as though she chose to encompass these personalities for the fact that ""people don\'t accept her as herself"". While the author herself maybe a researcher she seemed to lack basic knowledge of abnormal psychology.Most people gain more personalities when they are exposed to EXTREME trauma. Such as: sexual abuse, intense physical and/or emotional abuse, or some other very traumatic experience (like a car crash that left someone injured very badly). And so on. From what I could tell, the characters made it seem like she encompassed more personalities because she was lonely because ""uwu im lonely :( gotta make more people to talk to"". This type of thing is very harmful, but what ever. The anime did what it did, can\'t change it now.Now, on to the thing that I think bothered me the most in this anime, she fucks her uncle. I believe his reasoning is because ""well she was 13 and very mature"".   Excuse me? What the fuck kinda excuse is this? She is mentally ill and he fucks her. Like what the ACTUAL fuck.4/10 -would never recommend to anyone would strongly advise against.One redeeming quality? I guess I see what she was kinda going for with cool mystery, but these things can only be overlooked so far for me.

Perfect Insider has so much wasted potential due to two big issues: lacklustre character development and trying to be too many things at once. Let's talk about the former first.I know this is an adaptation of a novel but since I haven't read any of it my review will be based purely on the anime itself. First of all, I couldn't help thinking throughout the whole show how much better it would be if they had just gotten rid of Nishinosono. Her only purpose is to contrast...the main character, who finds it a need, for some reason, to blatantly remind us all the time. Other than that she's just an empty shell for him to verbalize his worldviews and philosophies to.Secondly, how can the protaganist's character be so much more underdeveloped than the antangonist and his sidekick? There is no backstory and premise that leads to him being who he is now. No one cares about his worldview if no one can relate to him. Dialogues are but means to an end, with the end being the viewers being able to connect to the characters. They have failed terribly in this aspect and poured all their efforts in the means. And other than being freakishly smart, Magata happens to be a self-justified psycho too? Care to work on her innerworld a little more and make us understand how she became who she is? It appears that whoever wrote her (for the anime at least) can't seem to figure out how to shape her character properly.Now let's talk about trying to be too many things at once.Expectations generally vary greatly between fans of different genres. While it isn't uncommon for geners to crossover, it requires much finesse to weave them together. The Perfect Insider lacks it unfortunately. If you try to become everything to everyone, then you will accomplish being nothing to anyone. I give it a score of 1 for romance, 6 for mystery, and 5 for literature. If they has just dropped any of the 3 mentioned above, the whole show would be greatly more enjoyable:- Drop the romance and get rid of Nishinosono. Focus more on the character development of Saikawa and Magata.- Drop the literature and the floating head syndrome and work more on the mystery and character development.- Drop the mystery and focus more on the romance and literature AND, once again, character develpoment.Anyway, end of rant. 6 out of 10 for me. the main character, who finds it a need, for some reason, to blatantly remind us all the time.

The perfect insider fits its name perfectly. In its own way, it\'s flawless. I\'ve always liked psychological and mystery themed plots cause it always makes me think. It triggers deep thinking that perhaps my brain slyly enjoys. And this anime, it\'s one of those.The animation is splendid but then I was never really that attentive on such. Personally, It\'s beautiful. I\'ve always loved the ocean and it was shown in the story for a couple of times. The concept was impressive as well. It was well thought too. Since...I\'ve seen quite a few of the psychological anime, I\'ve observed that some anime tries to appear to be intellectual that it comes to a point that it tries to mimic other elements from the other anime. It\'s indeed common in anime to have the same things and settings but that doesn\'t mean that it needs to be executed similarly too. I wouldn\'t name them since I\'m also bad at remembering but I am sure I dropped some series cause of this. (I was never that active in mal so it doesn\'t really get updated either.)Also, I find it very impressive that there are no plot holes. If you seem to missed something, I guess you should watch it again. It was explained and shown. The story has a moderate pacing too so it wasn\'t really hard to catch up on what the characters were thinking. As for the characters, Dr. Magata sure is something. She\'s complicated but also simple at the same time. One of the things that I loved about her character was her unpredictability. She\'ll make it seem that you thought you had her all figure out but it\'s actually the opposite. She\'s interesting and a dangerous one too. The two main were great but sometimes the girl\'s talkativeness annoys me. It was bearable though. It\'s also essential in the series to complement Sensei\'s character. Be wary though, there\'s an illicit affair going on over some characters. It bothered me at some part but cause of that, I figured it out as well. It was fun coming up with answers xd Overall, I think it deserves a 9. I enjoyed it very much but it lacked something. I guess after perhaps figuring it out, when the revelation and conclusion happened in the last eps it wasn\'t that much surprising anymore. I guess that\'s why.To think that a 5 year old child already had her own existential crisis, that sure is something. I agree to Sensei\'s statement that Dr. Magata is pure; a purity that can never be achieved by normal humans; a purity that breaks all the customary morals in our present society. I\'ve always admired intelligent people perhaps it\'s cause of a silly reason too. It\'s that they\'re not afraid to be different and Dr. Magata is one of them. Although no matter how much she seeks for freedom, I don\'t think she\'ll ever achieve it. I believe she\'s a weak person, thus she creates personalities from people that once offered her a safe haven. I suppose that it imprisons her more. But then, I guess that\'s her version of reality and one can never truly understand it. The human mind is a complex matter. That fact alone makes everyone of us interesting individually. I must say that her questions really does make you think. ""Who are you?"" ""Why are you here?"" ""Where are you going?"" Questions that has no validity of correct answers. It\'s just a matter of your own conviction and morals.

These categories don\'t really contribute much to my impression of the show.Next is the meat and potatoes: The story and characters.I think most people watch mysteries to try to figure them out alongside the lead characters, but the impression I get here is that save for a few people who figured it out instantly and were bored...the whole way through, most people were strung along at the mercy of some very obtuse, misdirecting hints. Some examples:-The show continually stresses that the robot who can lock and unlock doors is important, but in the end the plot piece it was tied to was just really unnecessary and contrived.-There\'s this great big symbolic parallelism thing with the bloody doll that is thrown away and Moe\'s bloody doll-like dress that gets thrown away, and it\'s just meaningless to the plot entirely.-The show is full of red herrings like the drill with the metal filings and the television parts. They\'re not even addressed as red herrings though, they\'re just disappointing.Then when not being misdirected, the viewer is at the mercy of what the characters will investigate and what information will not be withheld until the near-end. To put it vaguely: there are several instances where the characters will confirm that something is the case multiple times, and then they\'re just wrong. Plot twists are nice and all, but these just makes you feel like the information you\'re given is meaningless and that you\'re not meant to be solving, just along for the ride.Then let\'s talk about the characters. The show just feels like it\'s constantly trying to flex how intelligent and philosophical the characters are. Like there\'s just some really basic nihilism being toted as philosophical genius. Aside from that, the main characters get a mediocre romance, and I guess smoking counts as a personality now too. That\'s about it.The other thing is like, are we just gonna skip over the whole incest childrape thing? Like normal people: ""The timeline works out that she needs to have had sex in her early teens. Should we rewrite? Maybe at least find her a lover her age?"" This show: ""Idk, make her screw her uncle."" It just kind of made the show very uncomfortable to watch while serving no purpose but to do just that.In conclusion this show was entertaining, but was a bit pretentious and contrived. the whole way through, most people were strung along at the mercy of some very obtuse, misdirecting hints.

So let\'s just get to this.*Review will have spoilers* Simply because I can\'t tell what I like...and dislike about the show without spoiling it a bit.First start with the story, Magata Shiki is a genius programmer who has lived her life on a Island and doesn\'t meet any guests or anyone so basically a shut in and one day when Two MC arrived on the Island and went to that Facility to actually meet Dr.Magata but ended up investigating two murder cases which happened just when they were about to meet Dr.Magata. That\'s it for the plot. It turns the murder was of Dr.Magata Shiki actually and right after that a another murder acquired makes it two murder cases. Now what bothered me the most was the character of Dr.Magata Shiki and it seemed like I was the only one who couldn\'t feel any sympathy for her character or never even liked the character no matter how hard they tried to show her as a genius and a total intellect I just couldn\'t get over the fact that was a freaking MURDERER and that to of her own parents. Yeah she was murderer and everyone seemed to be inspired from her and completely ignoring the fact that she was actually a murderer except for the main girl in the show named ""Moe Nishinosono"" who actually gave two shits about the murder of her parents and why she did it.Let\'s talk about characters now. As I already mentioned Magata Shiki was a murderer but not only that she was a fucking psychopath who doens\'t have any valid reasons behind killing her parents(even if she did that still would\'t change the fact that she is a murderer) but instead she just killed them because she wants ""Freedom"" Yes that\'s right, FREEDOM. To her freedom means killing all those who might stop you from doing anything. This is just SICK and twisted, how can one even like her character is beyond me also she was a Emo retard quoting nonsense like ""Why do humans exist and shits like that"" throughout the series so I guess you have got an pretty good idea of what her character was like. Those two things aside she also killed her daughter just because she couldn\'t kill Magata Shiki. *Sigh* I don\'t understand why people like her so much like WHY? As for our MC named ""Sohei Saikawa"" a genius professor who admires the personality of Magata Shike and declares her as the ""Most Pure Human Ever"" do I need to say more? I guess you have got a pretty good idea of how big of a Emo he was and Lastly our Main Girl ""Moe Nishinosono"" who was mostly obsessed with the teacher but somehow actually had a brain and questioned the Morals of Dr. Magata Shiki.The Mystery in this Anime was done pretty well in my opinion. The way story progressed was also pretty well-done. My only problem with the show is that they never really gave any solid reasoning behind the murder except that it was a form of showing ""Love"" really? LOL sorry with that kinda shit it\'s almost impossible to like the character of Magata Shiki. Her thoughts about humans were retarded, she was a murderer(Yes I will say it again and again) and above all that she was never caught and is living freely after committing all those crimes and never had any sign of regret like she just took the lives of 4 freaking people just because she had nothing better to do. People praising the hell out of Magata Shiki in the reviews is really really getting on my nerves now.All and all this show is good however the characters specially the character of MAGATA SHIKI is beyond retarded. and dislike about the show without spoiling it a bit.First start with the story, Magata Shiki is a genius programmer who has lived her life on a Island and doesn\'t meet any guests or anyone so basically a shut in and one day when Two MC arrived on the Island and went to that Facility to actually meet Dr.Magata but ended up investigating two murder cases which happened just when they were about to meet Dr.Magata.

People praising the hell out of Magata Shiki in the reviews is really really getting on my nerves now.All and all this show is good however the characters specially the character of MAGATA SHIKI is beyond retarded.', 'Story 5/10If I had to summarize this series in one word I would say ""over-complicated"". Sure, I like wild stories in mystery series as much of the next guy but The Perfect Insider takes it to a new level of unanswered questions and out-there theories that the main character just **suddenly realizes** with very limited investigation. If I had to describe it in another word, I would add ""frustrating"". The mystery begins in episode 2 (or 3?) and they don\'t do any actual investigation until episode seven. Everything up until then is a lazy romance plot that is very lackluster and a lot of repetition...of stuff the audience already knows. Numerous scenes where they just repeat ""What did he mean when he said that?"" and ""How did they get in and out of the room?"" and ""What does F stand for"" but the audience works with pretty much nothing while the protagonist and his lackey magically pull these extremely spot-on theories out of nowhere. I mean seriously, the audience gets to work with nothing and then the protagonist spouts about how ""obvious"" the answer was.Art 7/10A bit inconsistent but primarily good. Overall character design, backgrounds, and animation quality were decent, but Nishinosono is an outlier in this because he design was pretty bad and she was the only one i noticed where sometimes her eyes weren\'t sitting even or her nose disappeared or something like that. The art was probably the best part of the series I\'ll just say that.Sound 5/10The OP theme was really catchy but the use of sound effects, soundtrack and the ending theme were very bluh. Sound affects were at times abnormally loud for something like opening a book or setting down a cup, and then the soundtrack would be very mellow during a scene that was supposedly very dramatic and that was also confusing to me.Character 2/10Arguably the most frustrating thing about this series were the characters. I don\'t really know why they bothered creating characters that only served the purpose of ooeing and aweing at Saikawa, the ultimate super-genius that nobody questions because he\'s so cool and complicated that he is just on a completely different level from anyone else blah blah blah. Saikawa was so flawed and nobody really acknowledged it because he deflects everything every character says with word vomit about how he understands the real world better than them. I mean, a bulk of the series is him praising this incestuous murderer as being the most enlightened and admirable person he knows. Seriously? Nobody is going to mention that? And Nishinosono was annoying as a character that was set up to be ""the cutesy one who fawns over Saikawa constantly"" but there are times where Saikawa directly rejects her and she freaks out and tries to hit him? Thats not exactly a great love story thats being set up is it? And all the other characters are on the back burner of importance as in they do nothing and don\'t stand out.Enjoyment 3/10I\'ll admit it had me hooked with the concept of a ""locked room murder mystery"" but there is a literally a million more ways that the mystery could\'ve been solved without the enormous amount of roundabouts and guessing that the characters did to get there. The only reason I\'m giving it a 4 is that is wasn\'t genuinely terrible to watch until around episode 6 where I kind of realized that there was a lot of wasted time in between important events that the characters could\'ve spent oh I don\'t know...investigating the murder they\'d just been involved in instead of tossing around a lousy going-nowhere romance subplot that wasn\'t going to be fulfilled in the end anyway.Overall 4/10I\'d grade it lower if not for the fact that it did keep my attention (which is more than I can say about some anime) and the art/op theme were appealing. The ending was not satisfying by any means, a lot of questions went unanswered (I\'d list a few but they\'d be spoilers) and the whole ""this crazy incestuous murdering woman was actually a super genius"" left a bad taste. Wouldn\'t recommend it honestly. of stuff the audience already knows. Numerous scenes where they just repeat ""What did he mean when he said that?"" and ""How did they get in and out of the room?"" and ""What does F stand for"" but the audience works with pretty much nothing while the protagonist and his lackey magically pull these extremely spot-on theories out of nowhere. I mean seriously, the audience gets to work with nothing and then the protagonist spouts about how ""obvious"" the answer was.Art 7/10A bit inconsistent but primarily good. Overall character design, backgrounds, and animation quality were decent, but Nishinosono is an outlier in this because he design was pretty bad and she was the only one i noticed where sometimes her eyes weren\'t sitting even or her nose disappeared or something like that.

That is to say, this anime is hospitably bizarre- if you approach it with humility.Bizarre is defined as strange or unusual; or unfamiliar. What makes something familiar? Isn\'t it that we have seen it before? That\'s right, this anime provides none or inadequate context to properly explain most of the characteristics of the characters. The interactions themselves, however (save for a few flashbacks), are polite and courteous, even when there is conflict despite their ostensible oddness (for example, the director\'s...thumbs up). Furthermore, the odd idiosyncrasies of characters will easily make you chuckle (but not laugh).Philosophically, this show questions ""madness"" in a way that is reminiscent of psychologists such as Thomas Szaz and R.D. Laing (does it exist, or is it simply beyond the understanding of most people?). The explicable (but decontextualized) actions of the protagonists and antagonists, which seem to frustrate some viewers, are actually consistent with what the show suggests: that madness is a cop-out of an explanation brought on by not enough understanding, and that us, the viewers, simply don\'t have enough knowledge to understand.The story itself is enjoyable, but the world is incredibly sand-boxy. Anything you can imagine can exist because people are smart, and smart people can do anything. The seeming lack of effort and occasional Jimmy Neutron-esque clips before Saikawa\'s epiphanies are pretentious and distract us from the story.Despite some unnecessary sequences, Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider will keep your attention, ask important questions, and then disappear without a trace. thumbs up).

I won\'t write much about the story but I\'ll just expand on why I think it is really extraordinary without spoiling much content.On the surface, this seems like a sub-par mystery anime involving a smart detective solving a hard case. But it will definitely surprise many of you. The story slowly reveals itself through many clues dropped throughout every episode. Moreover, it takes a long time to analyze information that is given along with many twists in the story. The final few...episodes was really intense as the story unravels itself after the buildup.One of my favorite quote in this anime is ""when everything becomes F.""In conclusion, if you really enjoy mystery / sci-fi anime, I would highly recommend this.

It doesn\'t seem anything out of the ordinary of the mystery genre, does it? Well, in Subete ga F ni Naru, mystery is not its reason for existence, but the attention and internal reflection on what happens there. It\'s about freeing the mind from limits or conventions to understand a situation that is beyond what seems to be happening. Don\'t worry, this is not exactly a spoiler. I just want to say that you have to watch this anime with a slightly different point...of view than usual. And that differential is a strong point of the anime.The anime plot is magnificent. The succession of events takes us by surprise several times. With each episode that ends, you get more intrigued without being able to find answers or reasons for the events. Only, perhaps, you may not like the rhythm of the anime, since for some it may sound slow. But not for me. The rhythm of the anime was perfect and it passed quickly. The direction of the anime was very professional and competent, no doubt.The script is a very good aspect of the work. For example, the dialogues are coherent and cohesive. However, this does not mean that they are easy to understand, as their complexities demand an extremely open and reflective mind, as well as those of the main characters, who play the roles of introspective.The characters are very well developed and their interaction is exceptional; it is hard not to like the fluidity that occurs between them in the midst of mystery. Now, don\'t expect to exactly identify with the characters emotionally, after all this is not the core of the work. The core is the work of introspection and reflection. But if you happen to identify yourself with any of them, I would say that this will be a great bonus for your experience with this anime, because, as I said, they are very well developed. And if you notice that some detail is missing, I recommend interpreting this as being part of the idea of the work and the perpetuation of its mystery.The animation was beautiful and extremely effective, because it showed itself most of the time well designed, with a sometimes grayish and sometimes quite colorful colorization, with a good rhythm, with interesting ""camera shots"" and with scenes that exactly translate the introspective conception of the anime.The soundtrack was 10/10. The opening song, along with its psychedelic animation, are extremely contagious, thus combining with the imaginative side of the work and making you already excited to watch more of anime. The closing song is another one that is very good and combines more with the computer logic side of anime. The internal soundtrack of the episodes was also competent. The direction got it right with the soundtrack in general.I always try to see things out of cliché, that is, I always try to watch animes that present me with new ideas or proposals that I haven\'t tried yet and Subete ga F ni Naru has given me this differentiated experience, which has even instigated my self-knowledge even more.For Subete ga F ni Naru: The Perfect Insider I give Very Good = 8/10.I strongly recommend that you watch!And here I close this review.

Espero ter-lhe convencido a assistir. Até uma próxima!', 'It\'s very odd witnessing shows to the likes of Subete ga F ni Naru... intentionally sterile shows. Very sterile. It feels more like reading a book than watching an anime, and not a good one at that. Subete ga F ni Naru is clearly focused on delivering one murder mystery, that of a person and their interpretation of the world. Thus, its objective should be non other than to invoke the gears inside your mind; to make you think, make you ask, and when you find the answer, make you stand in awe at the view. As to how much this anime succeeded in that...-- that is to say, how intellectually stimulating it managed to be, even with its philosophically engaging dialogue -- is to me, arguable.For once, you can spot the pseudo-intellectualism. To the writer, having characters solve stupidly hard math really quick, or having them say ""no one has ever managed to surprise me"", translates to prodigious levels of intellect. Yes, these are indicative of high intelligence, but this anime doesn\'t have any other ways to effctively say ""look, this character is actually really smart"", which in turn makes them look like either prophets or clowns. Plus, the programming references are kinda funny, though I will spare the nitpicking since the source material dates back to 1996.Combine to the above, the ambiguous morality of this show. This anime attempts to conceal literal degeneracy, either by toning down external reactions, or putting a philsophical blanket over everything, even if thin. Specifically, Subete ga F ni Naru is shamelessly trying to overlook the atrocities of murder and pedophilia. I\'m totally in when it comes to exploring such morbid themes, but this show doesn\'t take any precautions whatsoever in tackling them. It just ignores everything. It\'s seriously, SERIOUSLY poisonous. In the final episode, even suicide is openly suggested. Unless there are solid philosophical foundations and strong counter arguements to explore these subjects, shows like this should stay away from them. Pretending to be clever is one thing... but ignoring the gravity of these crimes under the pretext of ""I\'m just different"" is unforgivable. At the very least, it doesn\'t try to justify them.Characters are almost pure detectives - that is to say, characters without impact. Their actions do not matter, and neither do their thoughts; the main protagonists are simply two pairs of glasses, the Detective and the Watson. And that\'s usually what you want in a detective story... though when the show has nothing else to offer, it becomes a problem. Granted, Saikawa and Nishinosono have some quite interesting chemistry, though the latter is irritating. And Magata is just a troll. Seriously. It\'s a babushka doll of trollery and ""I\'m 14 and this is deep"" in its purest form. So while you can find some good dialogue between these three, there\'s nothing else of substance to be taken elsewhere. The same can be said for the rest: no other character is given enough background to become a suspect or even interesting in our mystery.Subete ga F ni Naru is an eleven episode anime describing the events of two or three days, plus some sparse flashbacks. And it doesn\'t do it well. Average production values and slow pacing. Dodges morality like the flu. Slightly mocking of your intelligence. It\'s dull. It\'s what you\'d see while travelling in a highschool trip, having nothing else to do; watch it cautiously in the hopes of getting a good mystery, realize that ""hey, these guys are pretty nuts"", learn something, enjoy the trolling, and walk away unharmed. There is philosophical merit to this show, it\'s not completely white. At the end of the day however, it\'s just an awkwardly made piece of work. It\'s mediocre. It\'s not insulting enough to be appaling, yet not good enough to redeem itself. Therefore, seize this opportunity to bathe yourself in golden irony for a moment: as it is, everyhing becomes Five for this one. -- that is to say, how intellectually stimulating it managed to be, even with its philosophically engaging dialogue -- is to me, arguable.For once, you can spot the pseudo-intellectualism.

Seriously underrated work. Deserves at least an 8.5 rating. If you like crime solving and some philosophical theme this is of your taste. I usually skim through the videos and determine whether to watch an anime or not. I think after seeing this i would change my POV.

Here\'s my opinion as of what makes this series good,At first glance, from the start, at episode 1, it\'s hard to tell that this show is going to be a locked room murder mystery, because they emphasized the character a lot at the beginning as of ""Who are they ?"" and ""What are their role in this story ?"", Their backstory, relationship, etc. If you didn\'t read the synopsis before watching this series then you would probably left wondering, what is this series going...to be in the future episode after watching the very first episode.When you look at in in a bigger scale, the premise is pretty simple actually. It\'s about a murder mystery, where it happened inside a room that no one went in or out for over 15 years. The main key to revealed the mystery lies in the character rather than the murder scene, at least that\'s what i think. Because throughout the series, the character has a lot more attention than the murder scene in addition when it comes to the character they put a lot of philosophical stuff in it which is one of the reason why i like the series a lot.Heck, even when they start the very first episode, they started it with some philosophical stuff about human itself which will keep going until the last episode, and i like it a lot that the each of the main character has a really unique way of thinking. In a normal human perspective, they might look crazy, but in that people\'s perspective whose have a unique way of thinking, we, the normal thinker, might look crazy. Which is why i think they put a character named Nishinosono Moe in the story as one of the main character, that has a normal perspective like any normal human, so most of the viewers whoa are watching the series at least has someone who they can relate to.For the pace of the story, i didn\'t find any problem at all. It has a really great pacing. Every episode got me excited. They balanced the proportion of the answer to the mystery properly and delivered it sometimes in thrilling way, sometimes in creepy way and sometimes in philosophical way. That makes it to the one other reasons why i like the series.And lastly, they ended it silently like nothing ever happened, at least that what i felt. it was a plot twist but it felt so silent and smooth rather than a bang which makes it the last reasons for why i like this series. The ending in my opinion was pretty satisfying. Everything was answered in the end but left in with a little bit of mysterious feeling of a flashback.In the end, in my opinion, this series is very philosophical. It was brave enough to dig deep into philosophical subject of ""Human"". Basically, the character talked a lot about human. Everything about human. ""Who are we ?"" , ""What are we ?"" , ""Where are we going ?"". I always admire this kind of topic to be honest since i was a kid, because i rarely hear someone use this kind of topic in a conversation besides philosophical person. Whenever someone or a character started a conversation with that topic, i always love it because whenever you talk about things like that, there are no definite answer. There is no right or wrong. To you it might be right but to me it might be wrong. In the end ""Right and wrong"" is nothing more than that. And that gives me a feeling/sense of mystery, which is what this series has and the reason why i like it a lot.Even tho the rating is underrated in my opinion but i feel like the current rating is the right number to give such series. To give it more of a sense of loneliness and mystery.Thankyou for reading my review till the end. to be in the future episode after watching the very first episode.When you look at in in a bigger scale, the premise is pretty simple actually. It\'s about a murder mystery, where it happened inside a room that no one went in or out for over 15 years. The main key to revealed the mystery lies in the character rather than the murder scene, at least that\'s what i think. Because throughout the series, the character has a lot more attention than the murder scene in addition when it comes to the character they put a lot of philosophical stuff in it which is one of the reason why i like the series a lot.Heck, even when they start the very first episode, they started it with some philosophical stuff about human itself which will keep going until the last episode, and i like it a lot that the each of the main character has a really unique way of thinking. In a normal human perspective, they might look crazy, but in that people\'s perspective whose have a unique way of thinking, we, the normal thinker, might look crazy. Which is why i think they put a character named Nishinosono Moe in the story as one of the main character, that has a normal perspective like any normal human, so most of the viewers whoa are watching the series at least has someone who they can relate to.For the pace of the story, i didn\'t find any problem at all. It has a really great pacing. Every episode got me excited. They balanced the proportion of the answer to the mystery properly and delivered it sometimes in thrilling way, sometimes in creepy way and sometimes in philosophical way. That makes it to the one other reasons why i like the series.And lastly, they ended it silently like nothing ever happened, at least that what i felt. it was a plot twist but it felt so silent and smooth rather than a bang which makes it the last reasons for why i like this series.

It didn't feel forced or like some kind of girl power moment. She's just a likeable good character, and her becoming an Ultraman fit naturally into the story.Now, let's talk about the new villain, Valkyura. She was great, fun and intimidating and I gotta admit,...one of the sexiest anime characters ever.

I\'m sure it was bad before, but one thing I dislike the most about this CGI style is the studio having the characters speaking dialog and then pausing to react to the other party or act out emotion afterwards with the movement trackers.

Even the main characters are only being developed in the final season, so it\'s no surprise that the rest of the characters won\'t be given much attention.The rest is the story.

It has a fun, and distinct cast of characters, amazing music, a good story, and is able to do so much in only 11 episodes.The main story is simple and straight forward, as most sports series are. What differentiates this series from other sports anime is that rather than being about a young, teenage athlete that's new to the sport, it's about a veteran of the sport trying to make a comeback. That's still not new, but in the realm of anime, we don't get that...very often.I would even recommend this to people who aren't into sports anime, because the sport isn't really where this series excels. Yes, Gymnastics is given a lot of attention, this series is also very much a character drama, putting focus on Jotaro's daughter Rei, or RACHEL, as well as the Ninja, Leo, Gozaru. RACHEL and Leo actually sometimes feel like they get more attention than Jotaru. RACHEL expecially, which fine with because she's a Queen.The series have plenty of other side characters who have their own subplots that really don't get much attention, but get just enough to leave an impact. It makes the series more flavorful, and makes such a small story feel larger, as we have other gymnasts, characters connected to Jotaro's family, or even Leo's plot. Some characters don't even have names, but they leave a distinct impression.I've gushed about the cast long enough, of course there's the production to mention. The artstyle is great. I like the character designs, and the coloring. Characters look simple, but distinct, and I particularly love the linework, as it makes the characters feel a little grounded, but also expressive.The animation itself isn't fantastic. It's mostly the bare minimum, they even made most of the gymnastics with CGI, and used rotoscope for the ballet. This is all serviceable, and never really detracted from the series for me. Yes, it would be great if they could animate each move in glorious 2D, which would allow for more subtle details, but this series doesn't come off as being high priority, and they sadly can't animate everything in 2D.My favorite part of the series' production is definitely the music. The background music is great at giving a sense of excitement during the gymnastics scenes. It helps adds a sense of fun during the scenes where it's needed. The background music is just all around, really effective, though there were a few misplaced spots.This isn't even going into the OP, and ED, which are some of the best in Fall 2020. The OP is catchy, fun, and lives in my head along with the  ED. The ED, Yume Ja Nai by Hatena, is the best ED this season, it's catchy as heck, and the visuals that go along with it are pretty nice as well. If you haven't seen the OP or ED, ya gotta look em up, Gozaru.It was unexpected, but I really, really liked this series, Gozaru.I consider a series that can do so much with so little to be nothing short of a masterpiece,If you have the time, recommend giving it a watch in Sub. I tried the dub, and I barely watched it before leaving, maybe it'll be better in the uncut version, but I don't like who they got cast as coach.Many thanks for reading, Gozaru! very often.I would even recommend this to people who aren't into sports anime, because the sport isn't really where this series excels. Yes, Gymnastics is given a lot of attention, this series is also very much a character drama, putting focus on Jotaro's daughter Rei, or RACHEL, as well as the Ninja, Leo, Gozaru. RACHEL and Leo actually sometimes feel like they get more attention than Jotaru. RACHEL expecially, which fine with because she's a Queen.The series have plenty of other side characters who have their own subplots that really don't get much attention, but get just enough to leave an impact. It makes the series more flavorful, and makes such a small story feel larger, as we have other gymnasts, characters connected to Jotaro's family, or even Leo's plot. Some characters don't even have names, but they leave a distinct impression.I've gushed about the cast long enough, of course there's the production to mention. The artstyle is great. I like the character designs, and the coloring. Characters look simple, but distinct, and I particularly love the linework, as it makes the characters feel a little grounded, but also expressive.The animation itself isn't fantastic. It's mostly the bare minimum, they even made most of the gymnastics with CGI, and used rotoscope for the ballet. This is all serviceable, and never really detracted from the series for me.

But how the story progresses and the characters go forward really keeps you going for it. This is one of those plot anime where you want to keep rooting for the MC to go forward. The anime felt slow-paced at the start, so it felt like just sticking to it to see what happens next. This negativity faded as the anime progressed, and must say, the ending was worth a rewind and replay for me lol.The art was good , as good as any average anime coming out nowadays, though...the characters seemed a bit shallow at first (only at first ). Another factor that also kept me going on was the music. The opening is NOT as good. I am not a big fan of japanese raps, leave apart some. But the ending is really vibing, smooth, and just what you need for a normal day: unlike gurenge or shillouette which keeps you danciing. This is a soothing song.This is a good watch for those who are bored by seeing lots of blood, war, and stuff.

This anime is not some super fantasy one, neither is an action one or highly dramatic. Some people might say it is just another sports anime but TO ME ""Taisou Zamurai"" has been a bliss. It depicts some of the struggles athletes have and what they can accomplish when they have good people around them to support their dreams! It shows the power of human will even...you are at your worst moment to step up and continue for yourself and for those who love you, no matter the outcome.

It was a huge surprise for the season, specially knowing how MAPPA was animating Jujutsu Kaisen and later Attack on Titan final season, so it ends up making sense Taisou Samurai is but an 11 episode anime.Taisou Samurai is a light family/character drama focusing on gymnastics. It was very interesting to see several different characters interact and engage in various types of drama but having the gymnastics in the background as a ""distraction"" was interesting because it kept an added variety to the show. This reminds me a lot of Hoshiai no Sora, which came out in Fall last year, except...that it is a lot more wholesome and lighter. The ending in particular was very satisfying because it feels like every character got their deserved resolution, even though some felt like it was a bit rushed, while the narrative was closed without any cliffhangers.If there is anything that I wish was different was solely that some characters, like Kitty Zhang for example, got a little bit more presentation and focus because it felt like they were introduced just to create a plot point, as Kitty for example came into Rei\'s life in order to make her realize that her dreams are important  and should be followed.Another thing is that I watched this anime thinking that it was sports first and light drama second but it was more the other way around, which I dont mind, but still would prefer it were the former.Either way, this anime was definitely a hidden gem of the season and I recommend to anyone who enjoys sports, although note like I said that it\'s just a minor part of the show, and slice of life/light drama that it is a lot more wholesome and lighter.

The premise is cool and the plot is executed well. A man named Joutarou Aragaki gets a shoulder injury connected to the death of his wife. Fast forward five years later he continues to do gymnastics but due to his shoulder injury his coach advises him to retire but Joutarou suggests he keeps doing...gymnastics.Joutarou takes his daughter, Rei on a trip to Ego Wonderland to tell her about his shoulder but is interrupted when an odd ninja named Leo approaches him. He then follows them home and keeps preventing Joutarou from mentioning the fact he might have to retire due to his injury.Joutarou’s character sets a good example for others. When watching him do gymnastics with a shoulder injury, it showed that he never gives up even when something really bad happens to him. He also has a good relationship with his daughter Rei, and they are both happy even though he has a shoulder injury and his wife is dead.Rei is supportive of her dad and she always goes with him and watches him do gymnastics. Rei and Joutarou have a good father-daughter relationship andnthey are both always supportive of each other.Leonardo (Leo) also encourages Joutarou not to quit gymnastics and because of Leos positive and supportive personality, he motivates Joutarou to keep doing gymnastics and not retire.Overall, if you like childcare and sports, you should watch this anime because it’s basically both. And that’s not really two genres you would see together but again this anime isn’t generic.Anyways, this is getting an 8/10 from me. It’s really good. gymnastics.Joutarou takes his daughter, Rei on a trip to Ego Wonderland to tell her about his shoulder but is interrupted when an odd ninja named Leo approaches him.

I started during my freshman year of high school and did it for all four years with private lessons on the side. I loved it to death. So, for an anime to focus on the sport is simply a dream come true. While it's been a few years since then, I still feel as though I possess some more insight than the average viewer regarding this anime and its handling of the sport. So is this sports anime everything I wished for? For the most part, yes.The Gymnastics Samurai oozes style....With a colorful cast of characters, and a banging OST,  and the smart utilization of CGI during performances, this anime will give you a stellar experience like no other in the sports genre.Now, the pacing in the series is much slower compared to most sports anime. They start you off getting to know the characters and their personal lives, making them feel more like people rather than empty plot devices.The show hasn't gone too in-depth regarding the sport itself, but what has been mentioned was relatively accurate, giving it some much-needed authenticity. I appreciate that MAPPA made sure to point out how gymnastics differs from most sports.The animation is what sold me. Most will criticize the CGI, but to me, the CGI is the most essential aspect even if it's not remarkably detailed. What matters is how fluid and how much of the routines I see. This is precisely what the Gymnastics Samurai does. The fluid CGI animation allows me to see the routines' entirety instead of cutting away from the action. As a result, I never yearned for more like I do in other sports shows where they show one essential play and focus on the monologues the rest of the time.The trailers have shown that other events will be covered, too, not just high bar, which makes me even more excited.I would like to point out that if you have no clue how gymnastics works, the show doesn't feed you that information, at least not early on. There also hasn't been much focus on the routines themselves despite being well animated, instead, they illustrate how Aragaki is training to get back into shape, and not overworking himself, which brings back memories. However, this was done to establish the eccentric cast making me actually give a damn about what transpires, instead of just throwing in cool routines without laying any foundation for the story or characters.Overall, the Gymnastics Samurai is a dream come true and is easily my favorite sports anime, a genre I usually find dull and repetitive. Here, it's refreshing, although a bit cliche in the first episode but tolerable.So, what are you waiting for? Go get gymnasty and watch the Gymnastics Samurai!

Honesty the anime is just great, at first I thought I would drop this after watching 3 episode but I was wrong.The story about a father being a gymnastic on a verge of retirement at his lowest career and manage to climb back up to the top captivated me and left me amazed. It was funny, beautiful, bittersweet, and most importantly It was inspiring. The cast has it's own story, screen...time and back story that It makes you invest in this characters.It is just sad that this anime was overlooked by the fact that it is a anime about gymnastics which is already a rare topic and shadowed by popular anime this seasonMappa did a great job in the animation especially in the CG department.Highly recommended this anime.Story: 9/10Art: 9/10Sound: 7/10Characters: 9/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: A BANGER time and back story that It makes you invest in this characters.It is just sad that this anime was overlooked by the fact that it is a anime about gymnastics which is already a rare topic and shadowed by popular anime this seasonMappa did a great job in the animation especially in the CG department.Highly recommended this anime.Story: 9/10Art: 9/10Sound: 7/10Characters: 9/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: A BANGER"", 'Original animes always bring a little fear to the audience, as there is no way to trace an expectation only with a cold synopsis and without many details. Taisou Zamurai is another show that arrived without original material and this time it worked very well. The anime overcame all criticism regarding its production and established itself as one of the biggest surprises of 2020.Taisou Zamurai tells a simple story, but functional and comical. Jotaro (or Joe) is a gymnast on the verge of retirement. He is known throughout Japan as Samurai and for taking his country high in the biggest competitions in the world. However,...because he has not had good results since his wife died and because of an injury, he is advised by his coach to leave the stage of the Olympic sport. However, something unusual happens. Days before his announcement, he plans to tell his daughter, Rei, but he has always had unforeseen circumstances and did not know how to resolve this situation. Not even a sudden event could free him from his problem. But what is this event? Well, during a father and daughter day, Leonardo, a self-proclaimed ninja goes to Joe and Rei\'s house, after seeing them in a ""ninja theater"". Leo, as he is known, asks to live with Joe for a while. Joe ends up not retiring, for not being able to tell his daughter and for wanting to continue to make her happy with his gymnastics, the only thing he is able to do in his life. So Joe, Rei, Leo, a bird named Bigbird and Rei\'s grandmother have lived in the house ever since.This unusual premise is not abnormal in anime, especially nowadays. Taisou Zamurai continues his proposal, alternating the family\'s daily difficulties, especially when it comes to the daughter Rei. Episodes like 4 show that she is insecure about her actions hurting others and keeps the difficulties to herself, because she feels guilty for most of the actions that happen to her, from bullying, to her father\'s training. For me, Rei is the character that evolves the most in the anime, and she is not even the main focus of the work, but she is a key piece for the continuation of the story. Joe is also an exemplary father, but fails to understand his daughter\'s feelings in the most normal moments. Having returned to focusing on the sport, he forgot the family routine, something common for Joe, but painful for Rei, since her father is the only person Rei dedicates to and is not rewarded for it.For this, Leo was the key person to bring the family together again. In addition to playing with Rei in the tedious moments of life, he encourages the Samurai to continue his sport that he loves so much. However, Joe\'s surrender to the sport causes a change in attitude in Leo, as it turns out that he is a famous dancer, from a world famous company. Leo identifies with Joe, from the moment he realizes that his recent friend almost gives up on his crush. Leo wants to get out of this difficulty, to get out of the eyes that constantly pressure him, in order to stop performing in the theaters. Leo spends the entire anime rediscovering his identity, even if internally. He wants to return to acting, but does not know what to do, fearing even an injury from Joe in the future of the anime, in the final stretch. Joe and Leo\'s friendship is shaken by this new problem, just when Joe is well with his body and his sport. Leo\'s concern for Joe is evident and portrays his old trauma.But there are those who say that the show sinned in introducing the dramas of history. To be honest, I understand that anime lacks quality in this regard. Although it is dosed and maintains a good posture, Leo was probably the character that caused it. In some episodes, we saw him oscillate sharply from an extroverted and playful being, to a young man who goes through problems leaving his comfort zone and deciding his actions without being bossed around. Such criticism is valid, especially when we did not know who Leo really was and what his purpose was in the show. I don\'t treat him with contempt, nor do I judge the anime for having this bizarre element in the middle of a spontaneous story. In fact, I even liked the way the anime created and moved Leo in its overall proposal.The anime would not be great if it were just for these elements, it would need to flow well and have an outcome equivalent to what was presented. And this is where Taisou Zamurai stands out. The show does not require a script that is very rich in narrative, nor does it need to have an impeccable animation, but MAPPA did an excellent job of using all the problems of the main characters and connecting them during the episodes. In addition, the animation and the OSTs are very beautiful, with a dynamic and well placed CGI. The fear of having three animes being made at the same time by the studio put Taisou Zamurai in check, since it was evident that this anime would suffer more than Jujutsu Kaisen and Shingeki no Kyojin: The final Season. But the show stood out and brought a pleasant surprise, which practically renewed itself as an anime and transformed the show into a work of art. Highlight for Opening and Ending, with two great songs. I liked the characters\' circus interaction in the first and I love the style put in the second. They combined well with the essence of Taisou Zamurai.In the end, Taisou Zamurai is a completely underrated anime. An exciting story deserves more recognition and I see that in the future. I loved the direction of the anime and was really happy with each new episode. It\'s not just a show, it\'s a fantastic lesson, both for sport and for life. Joe, Rei, Leo and Bigbird will always be in my heart. This group, together with the rest of the cast, formed a competent MAPPA work, which is to be congratulated.

I wanted to meet the creators of the show and embrace them someday, for having done one of the best shows of 2020!', 'Taisou Zamurai is definitely and oddball, it’s one of the most unique shows of the year and also one of the weirdest slice of life anime I’ve ever seen. The first two episodes are the divisive type that either hook you or alienate you to the point of dropping the show, which suffers from a serious identity crisis.The premise make it seem like it’s just a sports anime but no, it’s also a drama about a man who has to take care of his daughter all alone by himself because his wife died, it’s also a comedy that keeps throwing random things at screen, from...a fake ninja who is pursued by agents, to a weirdly drawn parrot, to a gyaru who changes her language at times, to an acupuncturist drag queen, to references to fictional action movies and the list goes on.It’s also a coming of age story since there’s a noticeable time invested in developing the protagonist’s daughter and how she deals with her dead mother, her absent father, the kids at her school that makes fun of her dad, the ninja’s weirdness and all that stuff.This weird blend of elements is what gives it an identity and makes it memorable but at the same time is what makes it hard to gain and define an audience. Everything gets its fair share of time but nothing gets enough time on screen before moving on to something completely different.If you just want to chill and be moved by Rei’s character arc, you have to wait until some episode decides to focus on that because in the middle you’ll get weird comedy and basic training, yet if you stick with it, you’ll get the best and most moving episodes this anime has to offer.She’s basically like Rin from Usagi Drop or Hime from Kakushigoto, only a lot more mature than them despite all of them sharing the death of at least one of their parents. Her character arc reminds me of some Simpson episodes dedicated to Marge or Lisa where they accept everything that happens around them concerning their families the best they can before they snap, then they deal with the consequences of their actions and grow because of those events, with the obvious difference being that her development is not undone because this is not an episodic comedy. She also gets to find what she wants to do with her life which is basically follow her mother’s footsteps.If you want to see an inspirational sports series, Joe’s arc is pretty well done for you, not only he practices a sport which wasn’t covered much in anime (right now I can only think of Ganbarist Shun! as an alternative, and it was a completely different series), but the show spends a fair amount in building a fading star type of story around him. At first, it seems like it was all due to an injury but as later episodes reveal, it has to do with his own regrets and traumas he can’t leave behind, until he does because he needs to regain his former glory in order to take proper care of his daughter.On top of that, Taisou Zamurai does the unthinkable thing of spending time in his training, showing concepts and rutines concerning his discipline and the ever present risk of not being able to perform ever again if he makes a wrong move or gets permanently injured because of excessive training, this is what other shows such as Iwa Kakeru lack and what I complained about in my review about it.The downside is that the actual sport is not shown in a very inspirational way, the training is mostly skipped, the matches are shown quickly, and the CGI models used in them are poorly made and even more poorly animated, this definitely does not make the gymnastics to look exciting.With that said, we see him recovering and training in order to make a new skill that will give him more points in his competitions and it’s partially thanks to his interactions with Leo, the fake ninja who’s actually a dancer. This guy is the weakest main character for me, he’s just clowning around for most of the time, and his own story is not that interesting nor explored much, but as his role of someone who has a positive influence on Joe, and at the same time gets influenced by him goes, he makes a good plot device.I don’t have much to comment on the comedy, it’s the type of random comedy I just can’t bring myself to like, it’s not the type of over the top humor that I hate (Nichijou, Asobi Asobase, fucking Pop Team Epic, stuff like that) but for a slice of life anime, this just puts me off. Whether if this is a negative or not, it’s entirely up to each person. One thing that I have to give credit to the show is not mixing any of this silly stuff with the dramatic moments, I may not like these elements, but at least the show does not suffer from tonal whiplash.As I hinted earlier, the first issue with Taisou Zamurai is that it’s poorly animated, leaving the sport aside, the artwork and the simplistic character designs are definitely lacking detail and the models get deformed from time to time, both the backgrounds and the effects are also simplistic and the motions, even outside the gymnastics, are rather poorly made.As for the sound, the voice acting is ok when it’s serious and mature and kinda bad when it’s silly and comical (except for Kappei Yamaguchi as that parrot, what a guy), so it stands somewhere in the middle, the soundtrack is mostly absent or forgettable, the ending is alright, the opening is not. I don’t understand why they went with rap of all things and even having these three voice actors who are not really good at singing and one of the characters hate (or pretends that he hates) the other two so what is he even doing there. The sound effects are very good to the most part, in both the daily life moments and the sport competitions.But down to it, Taisou Zamurai’s biggest problem is it’s biggest strenght, having this silly comedy thrown at screen and blend of different genres in just eleven episodes makes the pacing very uneven, constantly changing things and tones and dragging the plot down before forcing it to go really fast in the final episodes, thus making the show feel both fast and slow at the same time.If you want something rather unique, here you have an aging sportsman, as he is trying to get over the death of her wife in order to improve himself and be a good father, a little girl realizing what she wants to do with her life, as well as what she does in her school and her home, a breath taking dancer who runs away from the pressure of being amazing and pretends to be a ninja while he’s chased around the world by other performers, I think? I didn’t really understand what the hell they are, they look like they belong in Men in Black rather than here. And you also get a look at a rather unique sport.In the middle, try to deal with an acupuncturist drag queen, Kappei Yamaguchi destroying his lungs while voicing a south american parrot, a grandma who runs a bar and looks like she belongs in Gangsta or Black Lagoon that also drives the car of another person like Irisviel from Fate/Zero in a road full of traffic, from a stadium to an airport and back again to the stadium, mildly cringy and mildly inspirational monologues taken from fictional schlocky action movies, and an undeveloped romance between a guy who can’t speak normally and a gyaru whose words can’t be understood 95% of the time she talks, even when she’s not changing languages just because she feels like it.If you don’t mind any of that as well as poor animation, you get a mostly decently made story with mostly decently written characters, that got completely overshadowed by Haikyuu! As for me, if the show had one or two more episodes, its events were paced a bit better, and it didn’t have these weird elements and comedy, I would have rated it a bit higher, but I won’t since that wasn’t the case, yet I can still say that it is among the best shows from this year, even if that doesn’t mean much.As for some recommendations there are:-Ganbarist Shun! the only other pure gymnastics anime that I know of, but beware for it’s a school comedy with some ecchi.-Igano Kabamaru, horribly animated, among the craziest and weirdest school comedies anime ever put on screen, staring an actual ninja.-Usagi Drop and Kakushigoto (the anime versions of both of them), slice of life anime about grown men taking care of a little girl by themselves, way more simple but also way more focused. a fake ninja who is pursued by agents, to a weirdly drawn parrot, to a gyaru who changes her language at times, to an acupuncturist drag queen, to references to fictional action movies and the list goes on.It’s also a coming of age story since there’s a noticeable time invested in developing the protagonist’s daughter and how she deals with her dead mother, her absent father, the kids at her school that makes fun of her dad, the ninja’s weirdness and all that stuff.This weird blend of elements is what gives it an identity and makes it memorable but at the same time is what makes it hard to gain and define an audience. Everything gets its fair share of time but nothing gets enough time on screen before moving on to something completely different.If you just want to chill and be moved by Rei’s character arc, you have to wait until some episode decides to focus on that because in the middle you’ll get weird comedy and basic training, yet if you stick with it, you’ll get the best and most moving episodes this anime has to offer.She’s basically like Rin from Usagi Drop or Hime from Kakushigoto, only a lot more mature than them despite all of them sharing the death of at least one of their parents. Her character arc reminds me of some Simpson episodes dedicated to Marge or Lisa where they accept everything that happens around them concerning their families the best they can before they snap, then they deal with the consequences of their actions and grow because of those events, with the obvious difference being that her development is not undone because this is not an episodic comedy. She also gets to find what she wants to do with her life which is basically follow her mother’s footsteps.If you want to see an inspirational sports series, Joe’s arc is pretty well done for you, not only he practices a sport which wasn’t covered much in anime (right now I can only think of Ganbarist Shun! as an alternative, and it was a completely different series), but the show spends a fair amount in building a fading star type of story around him. At first, it seems like it was all due to an injury but as later episodes reveal, it has to do with his own regrets and traumas he can’t leave behind, until he does because he needs to regain his former glory in order to take proper care of his daughter.On top of that, Taisou Zamurai does the unthinkable thing of spending time in his training, showing concepts and rutines concerning his discipline and the ever present risk of not being able to perform ever again if he makes a wrong move or gets permanently injured because of excessive training, this is what other shows such as Iwa Kakeru lack and what I complained about in my review about it.The downside is that the actual sport is not shown in a very inspirational way, the training is mostly skipped, the matches are shown quickly, and the CGI models used in them are poorly made and even more poorly animated, this definitely does not make the gymnastics to look exciting.With that said, we see him recovering and training in order to make a new skill that will give him more points in his competitions and it’s partially thanks to his interactions with Leo, the fake ninja who’s actually a dancer. This guy is the weakest main character for me, he’s just clowning around for most of the time, and his own story is not that interesting nor explored much, but as his role of someone who has a positive influence on Joe, and at the same time gets influenced by him goes, he makes a good plot device.I don’t have much to comment on the comedy, it’s the type of random comedy I just can’t bring myself to like, it’s not the type of over the top humor that I hate (Nichijou, Asobi Asobase, fucking Pop Team Epic, stuff like that) but for a slice of life anime, this just puts me off. Whether if this is a negative or not, it’s entirely up to each person.

You are definitely wrong when you though the story only focuses on his struggles, but the anime brilliantly introduces other characters such as the Bandana's and Ninja's struggles too without pushing it too much but...enough for audiences to understand. As someone who loves small little things and details, i really love how some characters secretly changes expression, enough for someone who looks to see.When you wonder why Ninja look up to Samurai, and why Bandana has such rivalry to Samurai, you'll realize through the episodes and the final episode might conclude it all, a simple but sweet one shot scene!

I knew it was being made by MAPPA’s C team and that it was an anime original but the 1st few key visuals looked great. And then the official cover came out... And I said to myself: „Oh no”. I was looking forward to something even close to Megalo Box. However, i got something else...STORY: 4/10What the fuck is this. It’s weird. It tells a story about this once-great young gymnast that lost it all because of an injury and the death of his wife. You would think that this would go into...a serious story. No, it turns into a comedy that uses random=funny material. This and the pacing are the worst things about the story. It just goes from serious to funny and back to serious. At one point i remember the MC was having a serious talk to his daughter and in the middle of it, here comes this totally random ass bird called „BIG BIRD” (seriously??) that talks and is from some tropical country (i forgot which). The comedy isn’t funny, it just ruins the flow of the scene and ends up hurting the show a lot.ART: 3/10Let’s see... shit CGI... pretty bad character design... clunky animation... doesn’t look like MAPPA to me, not even their C team. It’s just bad, nothing that really shows me this is supposed to be a sports anime. So, they spent 40% of the budget on Leo’s eyes, 50% to get the water drinking physics from 3-gatsu no lion and the rest went to make the rest of this anime.SOUND: 7/10This is a part i actually like about this show. The EP and OP are actually really good and the tunes of the show are generally good. Still, they had only like 50 bucks to make it so of course we hear the same fucking tune 12 times. The score is good, but pretty small in size, so its not great. Either way, easily the best part of the show.CHARACTERS: 2/10We talked about the best thing, now lets talk about the worst. The characters easily ruin the show, they go into 3 categories: 1.Annoying: There are 3 characters in this category and they all suck. They aren’t even cast well and they ruin every scene with them trying to be funny or actually say something. One of them can’t even do exposition without being annoying.2.Boring: Almost everyone else goes here. They either do absolutely nothing or are just the most one dimensional characters ever (like the MC and his daughter).3.Leo: Leo is great, i like Leo, it earns the show a point in characters.Enjoyment: 4/10Speaking subjectively the show just isn’t for me. It’s really weird and the pacing is super quick, jokes just come firing at you when you least expect it. This anime is kinda like that guy that just can’t read the room, he always comes in at the worst times and just can’t help himself to say something dumb.Speaking objectively i see why some people would like it, I have no problem with people that think something weird or random thing happening is funny, so if you like that kinda stuff this might be a decent show for you.ENDING STATEMENTS: I thought this show was going to be a sleeper hit. I was wrong, Its pretty much what you think it is after seeing the cover and synopsis. It tries to compensate for being shallow with doing random stuff that you need to find funny in order to enjoy the show. In my opinion Taisou Zamurai end up being a pretty bad ride that i wouldn’t recommend.OVERALL: 4/10. a serious story. No, it turns into a comedy that uses random=funny material.

It deals with themes like struggling between the decision of retiring to support his family, or keeping on pursuing his passion as an gymnast.Overall, it\'s a slow burn story that\'s dependent on his character progression and his day to day life of practicing his gymnastics with supporting characters helping a lot along the way to keep the story interesting. The problem is that these supporting characters are really bad. Most, if not all characters are ones that...are more fit to be in a comedy slapstick anime than a realistic sports anime like this. Honestly, when there\'s a fugitive ninja that\'s running from ""agents"" that are trying to capture him, what genre do you think this character falls into? Yeah...these characters are archetypal and lack any sort of depth that\'s required in a realistic show about a professional gymnast. It feels out of place, and it\'s the reason why the show isn\'t that great.I also don\'t really particularly like the story. This is a show that focuses a lot on our MC\'s day to day life rather than training. That\'s fine and all, but there\'s a disconnect between his training and performance as a result. When I see him massively improve or perform well, I don\'t actually feel any progress myself. There\'s perhaps a small training collage/montage and a few lines said, which doesn\'t convey the feeling of ""progress"" or training.

Yeah...these characters are archetypal and lack any sort of depth that\'s required in a realistic show about a professional gymnast. It feels out of place, and it\'s the reason why the show isn\'t that great.I also don\'t really particularly like the story. This is a show that focuses a lot on our MC\'s day to day life rather than training. That\'s fine and all, but there\'s a disconnect between his training and performance as a result. When I see him massively improve or perform well, I don\'t actually feel any progress myself. There\'s perhaps a small training collage/montage and a few lines said, which doesn\'t convey the feeling of ""progress"" or training.

Because of this his daughter, who lost her mother at a young age, is often left alone at her home and has to deal with bullying from the kids in her class. Her dad, the main character in which i am supposed to be rooting for while watching this anime is always busy with his sport, so he has never once made it to a parents day event for...his daughter.

One time watch is definitely recommended."", ""This show does a lot of things - and I'm not even going to say it's doing them badly - but it's doing TOO MANY without committing to ONE thing to a satisfying degree. There's the kind of sports drama in an unusual sports discipline like Yuri on Ice where a previously failed champion has to fight his way back to the top. There's the father-daughter family drama like in Himegoto where a widower is torn between working on his career and spending precious time with his young daughter. If we could ignore the sports aspect, I would also compare the overall tone to Space...Brothers where a late-starter is trying to get into a highly competitive field with a big cast of colorful and quirky characters. But then there's the wacky hijinks featuring characters that would feel more at home in Arakawa under the Bridge, or Pyu to fuku Jaguar, including the whole sub-plot about the foreigner Leonardo who just gets dropped into the story without anybody bothering to ask what his deal is... and it's a huge deal! It would've been okay to have him avoid the topic to create more intrigue about the big mystery, but it really bugs me that nobody even TRIES to get an answer!So even though I was really interested in Leonardo's backstory (which only gets explored in the last quarter of the series), I think the show would've actually benefitted from him not showing up at all. He admittedly hogs a lot of screentime without contributing much to the plot progression besides creating convenient contrivances, because he's just soooo quirky; Whenever an issue would get resolved naturally but the plot demands for it to be dragged out a little more, let's just have Leo barge in and interrupt the scene so it can conclude at a more dramatic point in time. Even the drama about the big finale ended up being kind of a non-issue: Leo had already found his resolve to face his demons in the previous episode and he correctly trusted in Jotaro to perform well without him, because Jotaro's performance never relied on him in the first place.Without Leo in the picture, there would've been more screentime to focus on Jotaro's actual rival Minamino, or to give Jotaro more moments with his daughter, or to explore his daughter's resolution to become an actress, or to show more flashbacks with his deceased wife. Because all of those plotpoints get neglected way too much.Alternatively, I don't see the point in creating a sports drama about gymnastics - a discipline that very few people care about - if you spend less than half of the time on depicting that sport itself (I'm gauging it's only around 35~40% of the screentime). So a show about Jotaro actually retiring and then focusing on his post-athlete life with his daughter and his weird freeloader ninja twink would have worked out too in my opinion.On that note, it bothers me that the family owns a self-conscious cartoon bird that can talk, even though a dog would've filled that role just fine without damaging my suspension of disbelief. Penpen from Evangelion should be the benchmark for how far you could push unrealistic mascots outside of gag shows, and Bigbird is about 10 steps beyond that feathered biped.If only one or two of the things I complained about got omitted, Taisou Zamurai could've had enough breathing room to focus on less things. Maybe then it could've reached a level of excellence that I've been spoiled with by 3-gatsu no Lion.tl;dr I am a little disappointed.Final thoughts: The OP is staying true to the established formula of being quirky and misleading about what the tone of the show would actually be like.

Xin Shen Bang: Yang Jian,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51334/Xin_Shen_Bang__Yang_Jian,"[""Despite a wildly imaginative modernization, this is surprisingly one of the most faithful portrayals of the character Yang Jian from Investiture of the Gods, a 16th Century Chinese novel. From the character designs to the worldbuilding through meticulously researched historical details, Light Chaser really outdid themselves this time. And with mindblowing visuals that put hollywood to shame, this really is a movie that should be seen on the big screen.It’s technically the sequel to Nezha Reborn, but you don’t have to watch Nezha before Yang Jian, or even at all, as they are not connected (yet). However, as the New Gods cinematic universe expands, both...Nezha and Yang Jian's significance will increase, and they are a pretty good introduction into lore of Chinese legends. Investiture also shares canon with Journey to the West and Lotus Lantern, so there may be crossovers.Mythological beasts straight out of the Classic of Mountains and Seas, quotes from ancient Chinese poets and philosophers, archaic calligraphy and cultural relics, real life locations with historical significance and legendary isles in the divine realm, all help tell this story through a distinctly Chinese lens.The animation is cutting edge. Each character’s body language is unique, and subtle muscle movements like when Yang Jian clenched his jaw really gave the character depth of emotion. Attention to the smallest details like the different textures of the fabrics and the intricate patterns woven into them breathed life into the most mundane aspects.The cinematography also produced some of the most stunning scenes in Chinese animation history - Chenxiang walking through the curtains at Duyue Pool and the colossal monuments of the gods at Mount Hua elicit visceral feelings.Props to the animators for finally depicting an accurate Erlang. I was so sick of seeing the countless TV adaptations slapping a stylized sticker on the actors’ foreheads and calling it a “third eye”. That’s bullshit, they look nothing like an eye. I don’t understand why these modern dramas insist on portraying him this way. So it was great to see him back with a realistic third eye.Personally, I don’t have much to fault about the movie, but I can see how the 2+ hour duration can be taxing on some. Yang Jian is a movie that demands attention because it is a story that spans millennia. This is a character steeped in over 3000 years of history, so it would’ve been almost impossible to condense it into a single movie, and they had to add the plot of the Lotus Lantern on top of it. It might be a bit too ambitious for the studio, but that shouldn't be a concern for casual viewers.I would’ve liked to see the story focus on the titular character all the way through instead of Chenxiang, as during the second half of the movie it just felt like Yang Jian had taken a back seat.

Of course, it's starts with beachwear and swimsuits, it goes to bikini's and last but not least, swimsuits excisting out only three seashells (which is worn by...both male and femal characters).The art is good, perhaps a bit better then most in the series, which is good of course, the animation is still no the same level, while they did a better job on the sound, the voice-actors .. acted better in my opinion, while the background music and sounds are in better quality too and since it happens between two original episodes, the OVA has the same opening and ending as the series, which are in the same quality and contain the same clips.The characters are still the same, though we get more intimate with the female one's, and see the Order of Perverts in their natural habitat (So they wish).

Girls in bikinis, boys who want to peak, a bit of Louise x Saito. That's it.And since I have to write a longer review.. the story is absolutely amazing!

She hasn't exactly got anything to show off in the first place, so I don't blame Saito if his eyes are wandering more to Siesta or the elf girl.In all seriousness it's just your typical fan service OVA that doesn't really add...anything of value to the series.

Aggressive Retsuko: We Wish You a Metal Christmas,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38815/Aggressive_Retsuko__We_Wish_You_a_Metal_Christmas,"[""♪♫♬MAL review section is where I spend my christmasGetting upboats make me feel alive🎵Fuuuuuuck🎵*Aggressive Retsuko's xmas song, lyrics slightly altered*For a 22 minutes long special, this does its job. Heavily christmas themed, really giving that holidays feel especially toward the end. Character centric goofs are taken in consideration pretty well and the series own idea and comedy plays neatly with the setup.This entire thing is worth of watching solely for the scene where Retsuko gives her best wishes because it is totally cute and warm. It's nice to see Netflix do something fresh and wholesome for once. Recommended. "", ""Call me a Grinch, but even for a Christmas one-off episode, this thing is pretty underwhelming and really disappointing. I mean don't get me wrong, its still enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of the first season of Aggretsuko like me, but don't expect anything grand or hard-hitting. Otherwise said, let's delve into the holiday hellhole and rage against the tradition that is Christmas.Plot:This special has two convergent plotlines, one with Retsuko and her hyena coworker, Haida.This special takes place after season one, where Retsuko meets Haida in the hospital where Haida confesses his love to her. Unfortunately, things doesn't go according to plan and...Haida spends his days feeling unrequited and quite gloomy. This episode spends a lot of screentime on Haida, so if you love Haida, you're in for a treat. Anyway, Haida gets wind of Retsuko's ever-so-changing behaviour based solely on her Instagram posts, and in order to win her heart, decides to muster up the courage to ask her out for the holidays.Now for the Retsuko plotline. As is the custom, Retsuko finds herself in a predicament. It's nearing the holiday season and Retsuko is once again lonely and in need of finding others to keep her company during the cold, winter nights. She asks everybody she knows but to no avail (which is odd since she later had no trouble finding company out of the blue, as oppose to the first half of the episode where she was completely struggling to get somebody to accompany her). She also spends more time on Instagram, inspired by her gazelle coworker Tsunoda, and tries to feign her way into popularity (this does add up to a really great comedic moment, I must add).My main problem with this special was that it felt completely unnecessary and didn't really advance the plot, characters, or the themes of Aggretsuko that warranted a one-shot episode. Aggretsuko always centered on Retsuko's fits of rage against the social traditions, like in Aggretsuko (2016) where in each Christmas special she would screech about her lonesome and pitiful life drudging through the holidays when everybody she knows was having fun with their loved ones. She barely get those epiphanies, and when she does get one, it was the most unsatisfying fit of rage because of how anticlimactic it was. Her character development doesn't grow in any sort of way and overall felt that this was all a set-up for season 2 of Aggretsuko.Even with all that said, I still enjoyed this special and there are some standout moments in this that I can say will please anyone who is a fan of Aggertsuko.

A bit longer then the normal episodes of season 1, it not only addresses a plot point from the end of the first season, but retains all the charm of the cast and their various ways of celebrating Christmas. We even get a glimpse at Retsuko\'s ex on Christmas!This quick little Christmas special is not only funny, but heartwarming as well.

Witch Hunter Robin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7/Witch_Hunter_Robin,"['Witch Hunter Robin (WHR) is a dark, mysterious Anime centering around Robin Sena, a witch. Though technically, Robin is no witch, but actually a ""craft"" user. I won\'t go into details, but craft users hunt the witch users. Sound interesting? It is.The story behind this show really draws you forward throughout each episode. It\'s not a boss of the week show, and it\'s not a mindless action flick. You\'ll follow Robin as she finds out more and more secrets about the witch hunting organization she works for. The trials she goes through in order to achieve these hidden secrets are quite entertaining.The animation is...nothing amazing, but far from mediocre. Most of the series is shot in a dark environment, so be prepared to possibly turn up your screen/video gamma or you might miss a thing or two.By far the biggest plus for WHR is its music score. Absolutely superb opening song ""Shell"". All the other background music throughout the show fits in wonderfully too. I could not have asked for a more perfect soundtrack.The relationship that grows between Robin and her work colleagues is well drawn out. Robin\'s motives and actions are appropriate for her personality, and we see her change throughout the show as different things are presented before her.All in all, I really enjoyed this series. There\'s even some romance development, which is just enough to keep you hoping for something more. Gotta please us Robin fans. :) nothing amazing, but far from mediocre.

While some people might not appreciate or enjoy the genre or story, either after the fact or at first glance, I believe that anyone who loves intellectually grasping stories and characterization should at least try out the first few episodes of Witch Hunter Robin.While the story and plot is slow (sometimes tremendously), the overall plotline and conclusion to the anime makes you really see the epic and vast nature of just what was being approached with this series. Starting like any normal &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series, you are compelled into the daily investigations of...the STNJ, a &quot;secretive&quot; detective agency (ala Men in Black) that hunts down abusive witches, individuals with various sorts of powers. Even some of these STNJ members are witches themselves, including the protagonist Robin. Robin is one of those characters that, in my opinion, stays with you long after you forget everything else about the series. As simple as she may seem on the outside, her personality and emotions unravel and become apparent later on in the series, and it does not disappoint. Robin is not the only highly characterized individual in the show, however. I found all of the other characters we met with just as comprehensive a background.The art and sound in this show are very, very good, sporting a soundtrack by the same person who did the music for Rurouni Kenshin.Overall, it was an unforgettable show for me that I both enjoyed and basked watching hours at a time. the STNJ, a &quot;secretive&quot; detective agency (ala Men in Black) that hunts down abusive witches, individuals with various sorts of powers.

If, on the other hand, you\'ve seen a lot of this sort of stuff, this series will inevitably seem somewhat predictable.I\'ll not go into details to avoid spoilers, but let\'s just say that everything in the plot basically ended up doing what I thought it was doing. Masked soldiers, young girl with powers, weirdo green liquid, brooding hero-type, they were all unable to surprise me. Another annoyance was that I couldn\'t identify with any of the characters, which seemed emotionless,...even frigid, to me. Lastly, the plot takes way to long to develop. Nothing of consequence happens in eps. 2-10.So what is good? Well, all of the above may just be a way for the director to allow you to focus on and enjoy the atmosphere of the show. Even though I never managed to ""get into"" it, I still noticed the obvious attention that was payed to the every scenery, location, costume and just the overall detail. This also means that every now and then something comes up that is not explained, simply because it\'s part of the scenery and not part of the plot. In all, this anime does a very good job of presenting an alternate reality that is fully believable, and aesthetically pleasing to look at.So, this is probably a very good series for those that enjoy atmosphere but don\'t usually like the action / magic / supernatural genres, because those elements tend to overwhelm a series\' to the point of becoming rediculous.

I am usually a person that wont give a show really low scores like I have this one, but I just couldnt hold back.Ill start by telling you what I liked then disliked.What i liked was the idea that the people with the special powers, aren't aliens or people that have had crazy scientific studies done on them and got special powers, they are witches form the ancient times. Thats right those witches they talk about drowning and hanging in Salem. That is what had...me first go O.o this may be a great show.Sadly that is where it stops being good, and starts going down the drain. Lets start with the main character. You would think you get to see a lot of uses of her ability and get an interesting look at her mindset since she is one of these witches. You are wrong just as was. She is in an agency that hunts the bad witches that kill people and yet her power just consists of her catching things on fire. Believe me she does not do this in cool ways nor does her power get better as the show progresses. Her lack of power is not her only flaw, she is a horrible character!!! She is so very boring and is just depressed 99% of the time. And she hardly talks to anyone, nor do you hear much thoughts going on through her head. In this show there is so very little dialogue its annoying.Then there are the fights with the evil witches. They are horrible!!! They are just like the main character, their powers are not interesting int he least bit. One person uses the wind to cut people, and another uses the ground to make you trip and fall. And then these fights last like 4min max, and since the show starts off as a weekly episode witch hunter for the first half, this makes the show so lame and so boring.Then the second half of the show comes and gives you this completely awful story! Its awful because you start to think, who cares about any of this and this show really needed to be turned in a different way. Then trust me, the end makes you go, why did i watch this whole series and why was it so bad.I only watched this show because people on MAL and other sights all have it as such a great show, and it was a total freaking bust.

There are no fights against uber villains or anything of that kind, just brief skirmishes with small fries. Instead, this is a slightly more mature anime that is centered around characters and an underlying plot.The creators of this anime tried to keep the characters as true to life as possible while maintaining this kind of supernatural setting. You see that realism in the dynamics between them at the office (some character are older than others, for example) and in their histories as they're revealed. I thought that the characters could have been explored further, however....We're really only offered a superficial view of the characters. There aren't many soul-searching monologues in this series as you may see in others. There is not a lot of dialogue at all, in fact. More often, you'll see pointed glances or pregnant silences underscored with muted, suspense-building music. Subtlety is key in this anime, but in the end, we don't know the characters in this show very well, and we're not very attached to them, unfortunately.In each episode you learn a little bit more about Robin, the other witch hunters, and the agency where they work. Apparently, though all of the hunters besides Robin have worked for the agency for some time, they do not know much about the true purposes of their company and as their work continues, moral questions arise. Ultimately, this is the major question of the series: are witches evil and what is the purpose of the witch hunters? You'll find that not all of your questions are answered by the end of the series, but this dangling ending seems intentional on the part of the creators of this show. They leave the possibilities open.At the same time, Robin struggles with her identity as a &quot;craft user&quot; herself and the seemingly cool and professional Amon has to choose his loyalties. These were interesting aspects of the drama, but you have to be patient with this anime. The pacing is slow. Action is infrequent. You learn in bits and pieces about the organization and the world of witches in which Robin moves-- just as Robin, herself something of a newb, does. In fact, at one point in the series, there is very little action at all and it is almost slice of life, albeit a gloomy slice. It's interesting to watch as her relationship and trust with Amon slowly progresses, though this anime never approaches anything verging on romance (pity). The music, meanwhile, is is atmospheric and accomplishes its goal of intensifying the action, well-suited to a mystery thriller.While not exactly fast-paced, if you appreciate a story that gradually unravels with darker, subtle artwork, you may like this show.

Time I review another old Adult Swim anime that either nobody fucking liked or no one remembers! I\'ve already tackled Milk Chan, Reign, and most of the big bombs, so now I turn my eyes to Witch Hunter Robin. This is one of those ""no one remembers"" series more than it is a bad series. Robin is better described as mediocre than actually bad. This series did sort of well with the Hot Topic crowd for roughly 2 weeks in early 2004, then it dropped off the face of the Earth and I don\'t think anyone has brought it up since...until...now!Plot and characters: 5/10The plot is that there is an organization under the control of the Catholic Church that uses witches to hunt down other magic users and kill them. You would think that this would provide for an action packed and amazing adventure right? Perhaps a series like Hellsing Ultimate told from the POV of the  Catholic Church\'s Iscariot group. Instead Robin is heavy on moody atmosphere and very light on action. The first half of the series involves a crazy new witch turning up every week and Robin and company need to find and ultimately burn the witch. Apparently there is actually a plot in the second half that isn\'t just episodic or to borrow a horridly cliche\' phrase ""monster of the week"". However, I dropped the series around episode 14 so I didn\'t really make it that far. The plot and characters are ok, but this series was never able to hold my attention. It is SLOW! Now before you accuse me of being a little brat with no attention span, understand that Spice and Wolf is one of my favorite animes. I love the film Solaris by Tarkovsky! When I say this anime is slow, I mean it is fucking SLOW! Robin has nice, dark visuals and gothic cool factor, but at the same time it simply couldn\'t captivate its audience. It is basically like a really bad Tim Burton movie where Tim left the project 1/5 through production and let some hack director finish the film.Art: 6/10The art was pretty good for the time and the character models had a unique feel to them. It wasn\'t amazing, but certainly not bad.Enjoyment: 4/10Maybe if I had bit the bullet, strapped myself to my chair, and watched the second half the series could have gotten better from episodes 15-26. If there are any Witch Hunter Robin fans out there (I\'ve honestly never met one) who DEMAND I watch the second half because it is 100 times better than the first half than I might finish this series one day. Otherwise, I have no desire to have any further dealings with this mediocrity.Overall: 5/10If you are reading this, you actually made it this far into a Witch Hunter Robin review without falling asleep! Bravo! This series had potential and could have been good if it fixed its god awful pacing issues and had a better director. Instead it ended up a sub-par mess that will be forever forgotten from the hearts and minds of anime fans everywhere. now!Plot and characters: 5/10The plot is that there is an organization under the control of the Catholic Church that uses witches to hunt down other magic users and kill them.

However, I dropped the series around episode 14 so I didn\'t really make it that far. The plot and characters are ok, but this series was never able to hold my attention. It is SLOW! Now before you accuse me of being a little brat with no attention span, understand that Spice and Wolf is one of my favorite animes. I love the film Solaris by Tarkovsky! When I say this anime is slow, I mean it is fucking SLOW! Robin has nice, dark visuals and gothic cool factor, but at the same time it simply couldn\'t captivate its audience. It is basically like a really bad Tim Burton movie where Tim left the project 1/5 through production and let some hack director finish the film.Art: 6/10The art was pretty good for the time and the character models had a unique feel to them. It wasn\'t amazing, but certainly not bad.Enjoyment: 4/10Maybe if I had bit the bullet, strapped myself to my chair, and watched the second half the series could have gotten better from episodes 15-26. If there are any Witch Hunter Robin fans out there (I\'ve honestly never met one) who DEMAND I watch the second half because it is 100 times better than the first half than I might finish this series one day. Otherwise, I have no desire to have any further dealings with this mediocrity.Overall: 5/10If you are reading this, you actually made it this far into a Witch Hunter Robin review without falling asleep! Bravo! This series had potential and could have been good if it fixed its god awful pacing issues and had a better director. Instead it ended up a sub-par mess that will be forever forgotten from the hearts and minds of anime fans everywhere.', ""Witch Hunter Robin, anime by Sunrise, made in 2002, something I've unexpectedly picked up one day.  Well no harm done.  Let's start dissecting my classification shall we?Story-wise, it all starts slow as most introductions are want to do.  The STN-J, witch hunts, the replacement from a convent in Italy and all that jazz.  Most of the episodes were predictable, which left me with nothing to go on but character irony.  It could only take me so far however.  Sure enough a person whose three main weapons include surprise, words and a machine were enough to get the ball rolling....This is when the conspiracy starts, drawing you in, shyly stripping away whatever is hiding the truth.  At this point, the viscosity of the plot is just perfect and proceeds nicely along as it builds up to the end.Next along we have the artwork.  Pleasantly above average, with enough variations of shade that seem to be everywhere.  The characters themselves are fine, but its just personal bias that has me nitpicking on how they draw  mouths.  Additionally, astute watchers may be able to derive that Sunrise also does publication.How does a gun that fires bullets using compressed gas only sound?  Pretty damn realistic, that's how.  Every cut, graze and slice will give you something that's close enough to life but still loud enough to emphasize it's point.  Still, I'll be comparing the sound of the P90s fired in the anime to the real deal sometime and that may affect my score but right now, sound effects are good.  What really does it for me in the sound department, is the music.  I'm such a sucker for the stuff.  The various compositions easily set the mood, whether it be eerie or discordant.  The opening, Shell by Bana, is best listened to only as an instrumental in my opinion however, especially since the electric guitar is a bit more active.  The ending, by the same artist, is passable, I skipped it after the first episode.  That didn't hurt the score too much though.The focus is really on Robin, our titular character, setting up trials for her to overcome, seeing her mature from the, I would say, introvert into someone with more confidence.  That is not to say the rest of the cast should be forgotten.  Each and every one of them brings out something unique to them, whether it be Amon, the stoic and aloof big brother, or one of Nagira's staff, who may not have a single line in the whole anime but is able to communicate in his own subtle way.Enjoyment, well how hard is it to enjoy something this good?  Do I even have to explain myself here?  Enjoyment for me, its pretty much the Overall score, just averaging out everything.  Even after the whole event subsides it leaves me with a tingly feeling, that feeling of wanting more.  A good indicator that I enjoyed it.  I feel like I'm repeating myself at this point so this review comes to a close.  Should you like to take a dip into this world, be sure to watch out because nobody expects the Solomon Inquisition.

I finally found the complete series at a reasonable price. To say it was a disappointment would not do the series justice, it was a good watch; it just didn't thrill me either.The main characters proved very interesting and developed as the story unfolded which kept me engaged despite the slow pace at the beginning of the series.I personally thought that with a wealth of folktales and history associated with witches and demons the plot could have been much more interesting. "", '\'Witch Hunter Robin\' is fairly unique as far as anime goes. It had Witches, a Gothic atmosphere, Christian iconography, realistic character designs and backgrounds and a slow, deliberate pacing intended to draw in a mature audience. It had all the ingredients needed to make it a cult classic, but it never quite took off. It would be easy to say that it wound up forgotten among other early 2000s classics being released around the same time, but I think the answer is more straightforward than that - it simply isn\'t a very good anime. Its strongest aspects are, without a doubt, the art and sound...departments, so I shall look at those first.Visually, \'Witch Hunter Robin\' is easy on the eye. Simple, realistic character designs are placed against highly detailed backgrounds to good effect. The colour palette is dark, utilising different levels of grey and black to enhance the Gothic atmosphere it has going on. Lighting is used effectively to create mood when required. The action scenes also sport a good frame rate and feature some nicely integrated effects. On the whole, the art and animation is solid and remains consistent for the duration of the show without ever really going beyond the call of duty. Good, but lacks the finesse needed for it to be great.On the aural side of things \'Witch Hunter Robin\' fares equally well. The music is done by Taku Iwasaki, famed for his stellar work in \'Now and Then\', Here and There\' and \'Tengen Toppa Gurren Legann\'. Each episode is kicked off by a fast, grungy opening and then concluded by a more reflective, somber end theme. Like the art, the background music is subdued but captures the show\'s atmosphere perfectly with eerie piano pieces and fast electronic beats. While the OST may be good enough to listen to in isolation, it is undoubtedly better in context. As for the voice acting, it does the job. \'Witch Hunter Robin\' is a pretty mellow series, so the voice actors\' range aren\'t greatly tested in either the Japanese or English versions. The English dub is competent, similar enough to the original script without ever being so faithful that it comes across as awkward, so you could get away with watching either audio track. Having now finished discussing the technical merits of \'Witch Hunter Robin\', it would make sense to look at the bread and butter of any anime - the story.In a nutshell, \'Witch Hunter Robin\' is about a teenage girl who joins the STNJ, an organisation that hunts Witches - beings with supernatural powers such as telekinesis or fire manipulation.  With the aid of the hacker Michael, the loud-mouthed Doujima, the psychic Karasuma, the rash Haruto and the mysterious Amon, they all set out to capture Witches. While the premise may sound interesting enough, it\'s difficult to remain motivated to continue watching when you realise that the first half of the anime is nothing but your typical ""Monster of the Week"" affair. The first 11-12 episodes follow an episodic format whereby we\'re firstly shown a murder, the STNJ then perform a little research and finally the Witch is identified and confronted by Robin and co. It quickly becomes repetitive and the only thing keeping the viewer\'s interest are the very limited titbits of information we gain about the STNJ members. These episodes are on the whole unremarkable and among them I can only recall one highlight - an episode where the Witch happens to be a doctor. What made that episode interesting was the added focus on the Witch himself. This insight allowed the audience to sympathise with him, unlike the other episodes where Witches are treated as inherently evil and devoid of any personality. All a little too black-and-white.Fortunately, the episodic ""Monster of the Week"" formula is ditched in the second half as a plot begins to develop. Here the focus is shifted to Zaizen (the Director of STNJ Operations) and what his motives are, Solomon HQ, the Orbo, and the mystery surrounding the Factory. While all this is going on we also have a story of self-discovery where we gradually begin to learn more about Robin through a combination of introspection and her interactions with those around her, namely the STNJ members. While the second half is undoubtedly more interesting, it still suffers from its fair share of shortcomings. For one, these episodes lacked cohesion. \'Witch Hunter Robin\' hopped from one idea or revelation to the next like a rabbit on crack. It made a frankly straightforward show needlessly difficult to follow and the end result was a bit of a clusterfuck. A consequence of this was just how sudden some of the twists were. The lack of sufficient foreshadowing simply makes them feel contrived more than anything else. A little more diligence with the storyboard would have gone a long way. A special mention must also go to the conclusion. For an anime of this nature the conclusion is absolutely vital, but \'Witch Hunter Robin\' swung and missed completely. The whole thing was rushed and left many details and the fates of several characters unresolved. The complete absence of any sort of closure leaves a bitter aftertaste and prompts the viewer to ask as the credits begin to roll, ""is that it?"". Unfortunately, the disappointment doesn\'t end there as I am yet to discuss the characters.If I had to describe the cast of \'Witch Hunter Robin\' in one word, it would be ""forgettable"". How you feel about the characters during the first episode isn\'t too dissimilar from the last. None of the STNJ members seem to have lives outside of their work and in the end feel like pieces to help move the story along rather than genuine characters. You have the chief that always seems to be annoyed at something, the girl that\'s more interested in goofing off than working and the hacker guy that is rarely ever seen away from his computer. They are clichés and unfortunately they don\'t really break away from them. The main antagonist is laughably one-dimensional with the side and tertiary antagonists faring no better. Robin is obviously the most fleshed out given the series revolves around her, but even then she does little to endear herself to the viewer. We see her struggles and learn of her tragic past, but because the viewer can\'t connect with her the impact is minimal. Ultimately the entire cast seemed to lack that charisma and energy which draws us in and keeps us hooked and that is probably the main reason why completing \'Witch Hunter Robin\' felt like such a chore.Overall, \'Witch Hunter Robin\' is a show which is easier to respect than it is to love. I respect it for trying to be different by appealing to the more mature, western audience. I think it was bold to base an anime around catching Witches and I thought the Gothic atmosphere it had going on was a breath of fresh air. However, \'Witch Hunter Robin\' couldn\'t capitalise on its unique (by anime standards) concept. It was, to be frank, a complete mess. It seemed to be unsure of what direction it wanted to go in and the characters were among the most unremarkable I\'ve seen in a while. Unless you\'re a huge fan of mystery or are looking for something with that Gothic vibe then I couldn\'t recommend this anime to anyone. I think there are better options out there to dedicate nine and a half hours of your life to watching. departments, so I shall look at those first.Visually, \'Witch Hunter Robin\' is easy on the eye.

No? Thought so. Unfortunately that\'s most of what you are going to get out of Witch Hunter Robin, so if the aforementioned things don\'t tickle your fancy, I suggest you avoid at all costs.A little backstory tidbit before my review (feel free to skip if you so choose to ignore my ramblings ;_;): As a young adolescent male anime fan with a craving for boisterous shonen action and flamboyant spectacles, seeing clips of Witch Hunter...Robin on the Bionix block of Canada\'s YTV station, it seemed really boring and unappealing to the young me suffice to say. The colour palette was bleak, the pacing seemed slow, the action - very bland and the tone too brooding and reserved. Cut a few years later and I think back to the series and how with my tastes have refined; maybe a start to finish re-examination may have me ending up liking it, and some positive reviews from critics I trusted helped validate my decision to give it another shot...only for things to end poorly. Contrary to the situation with Kure-nai (see my other review) I ended up hating Witch Hunter Robin EVEN MORE as a young adult, and now every time I hear those beautifully melancholic opening and ending themes, my skin crawls as it serves to remind me  what a dreadful series it came from. No more woe, it is time for the RAGIN-I mean, the review.Story: Witch Hunter Robin (Bella) finds our titular character as a craft user (witchcraft -> craft = magic) working for a team of, well, other witch hunters cracking down on witches (this show\'s jargon for espers; can be either gender) who tend to be out of control and are misusing their crafts. The first 11 episodes follow a basic monster of the week formula where STN-J gets some hints on a witch and chases them down for inevitable detainment with some bits of mystery, slice of life and organizational politics thrown in to draw things out more. The problem is, the cases themselves are boring, and the suspects\' powers are really uninspired and redundant - about 80% of them use just use psychokinesis or some spirit channeling stuff with some really lame effects (and subsequently battles) that aren\'t enticing in the slightest. The other elements, again, are stuffing for each episode; the initial mystery involving the suspects using their powers for some misdeeds drives the conflict for the episode which is just humdrum stuff lacking major consequence later on or any immediate depth, the slice of life and STN-J affairs just kind of balance the capers out to establish the characters, the company and such, but the characters are all one-note and disposable; any attempt at characterization is one smile uttered from them or some purely expository backstory that they try to cram into a few minutes of one episode just to get it out of the way, simply resulting in a general lack of focus and half-baked story elements. On the matter of half-baked, almost each of these 11 episodes ends with a red herring that teases further developments but are ultimately shafted by the finale (more in a bit). You know what has a good monster of the week arc? Bleach. Those were the glory days, back when it was shiek and cool and had some spice in its formula *sigh*. -Back to WHR- In the midst of all this is Bella\'s rather contrived and stale relationship (or one sided yearning for) Amon (Edward) where she just kind of fawns over him passively and emo-like while he stays apathetic, angry and emo until later down the line. Once we reach episode 12, there\'s about a 2 episode mini-arc where they investigate some former witch village and some old woman gives a bit of backstory on witches (some of which has some real life historical references like the Salem Witch Hunt and such) and offers the revelation that--*GASP*--maybe not all witches can be generalized as evil! But our incompetent troupe ignores the old woman\'s apparent ramblings and returns to base before the typical ""government is evil"" plot twist transpires, putting Edward in question with his disappearance, STN-J shattered and Bella on the run. This leads me to one positive I have about the story: there\'s this little arc where the downfall of The Hero\'s Circle is shown as Bella\'s world is crumbling around her and she has to re-establish herself by way of finding a mundane job without the use of her craft to stay incognito while getting a source of income to afford living essentials and such; it\'s a rather interesting and grounded outcome to all the mayhem that transpires, but then the former STN-J members begin to regroup and plan their inevitable overthrowing of STN\'J\'s head Zaizen. Edward resurfaces along the way and is given the task of monitoring and protecting Bella but killing her if her powers get out of hand *groan* while showing subtle signs of reciprocating her ""feelings"". The opening animation alludes to the series focusing heavily on their relationship, but really it\'s one big ruse; Bella half-assedly pines for Edward, who neglects her feelings through a majority of the series and is missing throughout most of the 2nd half and he half-assedly comes to terms with her feelings slightly, that\'s it. By the finale (will try not to spoil too much, but I can\'t help but share how nauseating it is) everyone converges to stop Zaizen\'s plans, and the 11 monster of the week episodes with red herrings build up to...one really minor twist about the Orbo being made out of witches like the ones in said episodes TO FIGHT WITCHES. Bravo. That sociopathic boy smiling ominously as he was getting hauled away in his episode? Totally ignored along with all the others. Then Zaizen gets foiled (""Whoopee"", he says sarcastically), what happens after and what did the gang learn from all this? Nothing. They say: ""let\'s keep ignorantly hunting down each and every witch with Orbo but NOT be Zaizen and therefore, not be evil"". The series not only tried to show a grey area of humans and witches through the old woman at the halfway point, but also through the morally just witch doctor (OO-EE-OO-AH-AH) in one of the first 11 episodes, only to completely abandon any moral or thematic purpose it ever had and completely spit on it. It all caps off with a pseudo-ambiguous ending where Bella and Amon\'s whereabouts are unknown, but you see little glimpses of what could be the two of them in the very end, but I did not care at the slightest at that point; there was no reason for me to care whether they were alive or not and leave it all mysterious because they were irritating characters and the series had thrown enough crap at me that I already hated it. In short, the series is an insubstantial, dry, repetitive, morally-jaded and uninspired trash heap saved only by a short adequate little arc and not being too offensive. I should\'ve just stuck with my pubescent first impressions.3/10Characters:Hahaha! What characters!? Oh wait, I should actually try to fill this in? Okay, I\'ll make this quick. Bella is a whiny lovelorn emo teen witch, Edward is a brooding, conceited jackass (Sasuke fans rejoice!), Haruto is Guy A: the brash newbie, Michael is Guy B: the blunt hacker, Miho is Girl A: the psychometry-using...teammate(? lack of descriptors for her), Yurika is Girl B: the serious ditz and Zaizen the evil corporate guy. There are other characters who I\'ve mostly forgotten, but they are hardly relevant, I guess there was that potentially homosexual cafe owner, he was kinda cool I guess...but yeah, can\'t say I remember the others. So yeah, 90% of the characters are indistinguishable stone-faced agents who hardly have any souls. Paper thin cast.2/10Art & Animation:The art wasn\'t too bad, it had more of a Western-styling to it; the characters look more comic-esque--but to be more accurate--are rather sleek - a bit conservative but sharply drawn. The palette gets somewhat strenuous for the eyes with how muted and drab it is, but in small doses can look somewhat cool with the aesthetics. Some of the architecture have really eloquent Victorian (or maybe Elizabethan or something; architecture isn\'t my forte) designs to them that have a peculiar warmth, homeliness and style to them themselves. The animation on the other hand recycles in places, cuts corners, is very sparse and dated and lacks effort and splendour it seems. It all levels out to an okay image for the screen, above the standards of the plot at least thankfully.5/10Sound:Best part of the series (which can be rather unfortunate considering how weak everything else is). We got Taku Iwasaki (of Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal fame) doing the score, so that should connote a lot of quality, and Witch Hunter Robin is no exception. The soundtrack has a soulfully resonating and mysterious quality akin to his work on R.O.D (my favourite series, and which also has a lovely soundtrack) that simultaneously has an air of melancholy and grand transcendence; no complaints for music. As for voice acting, I listened to the dub and it was fine, and any poor sounding performances (didn\'t really find anything out of place)  would probably be attribute to the limited capacity of emotion for the characters themselves, so I\'ll be fair and only deduct one point for the voice acting sounding fine but apathetic for how their actual characters are so one-note, but still spot on if that makes any sense.9/10Enjoyment:If you\'ve read my other reviews, you\'ll know that enjoyment runs concurrent with story for me, so I was not pleased when watching this series. I kept clinging to those positive reviews thinking it would get better up to the very final episode only to be sorely disappointed. Heck, even my PS3 was making extremely loud and unsettling noises when loading each disc; that must have been another sign. This anime was one of the biggest wastes of time--and to an extent, money--to have been sitting on my shelf briefly.3/10To potential Canadian brethren who had seen glimpses of WHR on Bionix and were curious about it: ignore it and watch Fullmetal Alchemist 2003, Eureka Seven, or maybe .hack/Sign if you missed those among others (or something else that\'s great in this vast medium); to everyone else who has come across it: you keep moving along as well, this insipid spew isn\'t worth your time. It\'s certainly far from the worst thing ever, but left me totally deprived afterwards, and I wish for most of you readers to avoid the same anguish I went through.At least it doesn\'t have teenage werewolves falling in love with vampire babies or w/e.Whoops, said too much.*The More You Know* Robin on the Bionix block of Canada\'s YTV station, it seemed really boring and unappealing to the young me suffice to say. The colour palette was bleak, the pacing seemed slow, the action - very bland and the tone too brooding and reserved.

This leads me to one positive I have about the story: there\'s this little arc where the downfall of The Hero\'s Circle is shown as Bella\'s world is crumbling around her and she has to re-establish herself by way of finding a mundane job without the use of her craft to stay incognito while getting a source of income to afford living essentials and such; it\'s a rather interesting and grounded outcome to all the mayhem that transpires, but then the former STN-J members begin to regroup and plan their inevitable overthrowing of STN\'J\'s head Zaizen. Edward resurfaces along the way and is given the task of monitoring and protecting Bella but killing her if her powers get out of hand *groan* while showing subtle signs of reciprocating her ""feelings"". The opening animation alludes to the series focusing heavily on their relationship, but really it\'s one big ruse; Bella half-assedly pines for Edward, who neglects her feelings through a majority of the series and is missing throughout most of the 2nd half and he half-assedly comes to terms with her feelings slightly, that\'s it. By the finale (will try not to spoil too much, but I can\'t help but share how nauseating it is) everyone converges to stop Zaizen\'s plans, and the 11 monster of the week episodes with red herrings build up to...one really minor twist about the Orbo being made out of witches like the ones in said episodes TO FIGHT WITCHES. Bravo. That sociopathic boy smiling ominously as he was getting hauled away in his episode? Totally ignored along with all the others. Then Zaizen gets foiled (""Whoopee"", he says sarcastically), what happens after and what did the gang learn from all this? Nothing. They say: ""let\'s keep ignorantly hunting down each and every witch with Orbo but NOT be Zaizen and therefore, not be evil"". The series not only tried to show a grey area of humans and witches through the old woman at the halfway point, but also through the morally just witch doctor (OO-EE-OO-AH-AH) in one of the first 11 episodes, only to completely abandon any moral or thematic purpose it ever had and completely spit on it. It all caps off with a pseudo-ambiguous ending where Bella and Amon\'s whereabouts are unknown, but you see little glimpses of what could be the two of them in the very end, but I did not care at the slightest at that point; there was no reason for me to care whether they were alive or not and leave it all mysterious because they were irritating characters and the series had thrown enough crap at me that I already hated it. In short, the series is an insubstantial, dry, repetitive, morally-jaded and uninspired trash heap saved only by a short adequate little arc and not being too offensive. I should\'ve just stuck with my pubescent first impressions.3/10Characters:Hahaha! What characters!? Oh wait, I should actually try to fill this in? Okay, I\'ll make this quick. Bella is a whiny lovelorn emo teen witch, Edward is a brooding, conceited jackass (Sasuke fans rejoice!), Haruto is Guy A: the brash newbie, Michael is Guy B: the blunt hacker, Miho is Girl A: the psychometry-using...teammate(? lack of descriptors for her), Yurika is Girl B: the serious ditz and Zaizen the evil corporate guy. There are other characters who I\'ve mostly forgotten, but they are hardly relevant, I guess there was that potentially homosexual cafe owner, he was kinda cool I guess...but yeah, can\'t say I remember the others. So yeah, 90% of the characters are indistinguishable stone-faced agents who hardly have any souls. Paper thin cast.2/10Art & Animation:The art wasn\'t too bad, it had more of a Western-styling to it; the characters look more comic-esque--but to be more accurate--are rather sleek - a bit conservative but sharply drawn. The palette gets somewhat strenuous for the eyes with how muted and drab it is, but in small doses can look somewhat cool with the aesthetics. Some of the architecture have really eloquent Victorian (or maybe Elizabethan or something; architecture isn\'t my forte) designs to them that have a peculiar warmth, homeliness and style to them themselves. The animation on the other hand recycles in places, cuts corners, is very sparse and dated and lacks effort and splendour it seems. It all levels out to an okay image for the screen, above the standards of the plot at least thankfully.5/10Sound:Best part of the series (which can be rather unfortunate considering how weak everything else is). We got Taku Iwasaki (of Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal fame) doing the score, so that should connote a lot of quality, and Witch Hunter Robin is no exception. The soundtrack has a soulfully resonating and mysterious quality akin to his work on R.O.D (my favourite series, and which also has a lovely soundtrack) that simultaneously has an air of melancholy and grand transcendence; no complaints for music. As for voice acting, I listened to the dub and it was fine, and any poor sounding performances (didn\'t really find anything out of place)  would probably be attribute to the limited capacity of emotion for the characters themselves, so I\'ll be fair and only deduct one point for the voice acting sounding fine but apathetic for how their actual characters are so one-note, but still spot on if that makes any sense.9/10Enjoyment:If you\'ve read my other reviews, you\'ll know that enjoyment runs concurrent with story for me, so I was not pleased when watching this series. I kept clinging to those positive reviews thinking it would get better up to the very final episode only to be sorely disappointed. Heck, even my PS3 was making extremely loud and unsettling noises when loading each disc; that must have been another sign. This anime was one of the biggest wastes of time--and to an extent, money--to have been sitting on my shelf briefly.3/10To potential Canadian brethren who had seen glimpses of WHR on Bionix and were curious about it: ignore it and watch Fullmetal Alchemist 2003, Eureka Seven, or maybe .hack/Sign if you missed those among others (or something else that\'s great in this vast medium); to everyone else who has come across it: you keep moving along as well, this insipid spew isn\'t worth your time. It\'s certainly far from the worst thing ever, but left me totally deprived afterwards, and I wish for most of you readers to avoid the same anguish I went through.At least it doesn\'t have teenage werewolves falling in love with vampire babies or w/e.Whoops, said too much.*The More You Know*', 'This show started off well with random witch hunts but then moved into a plot driven storyline for the second half.  This wouldn’t have been a bad thing if I could just care enough about any of the players in the show.  But I didn’t.  Apart from the bartender I could care less about any of the others.  As for Robin, the main character, she was hard to like because her dialogue consisted of too many “hmms” and head nods.  I did like her hair style though.I have seen the term “monster of the week” being thrown around as if...it were a bad thing.  As previously mentioned this was the portion of the series I enjoyed most.  In defense of “monster of the week” shows I would like to point out a few successful shows that followed this from different genres.  For starters, Mushishi, my favorite anime, is basically a monster of the week show.  As is Law and Order in the cop drama genre and for the most part the X-Files.  If Witch Hunter Robin wouldn’t have strayed from this I could have liked it better even though I couldn’t latch onto the characters because then the show would have been more about the villains.  And, if for some reason I didn’t like an episode, I could at least look forward to a different approach to a plot in the next episode. it were a bad thing.

Whenever there wasn't fighting, the series seemed boring and slow.The music was wonderful, but very repetitive.You learn nearly nothing about the characters throughout the series, nor the plot. They seemed to wait until the very end to explain every single detail and the background of the main character. It was frustrating, because the entire series you wait for some more information and you get nothing but more questions.Every person will have a different opinion of this anime, but in mine, I did enjoy it, but I think I forced myself to...watch it to simply find out the ending. watch it to simply find out the ending."", 'I love the darkness that is in this. I first got into it by accident and it has had me hooked for a while now. The story line feels a lot like the idea of almost every business is corrupt and has some mystery aspects that almost make it go into a genre of its own. I would have liked to have more answers though, since some things were not explained well. In the end, I felt more like I had more questions then answers and made things a little bothersome. The ending flew me for a loop though, and I have no clue...what to think of it. I don’t think it was a really good note to leave us on. Another problem is we do not get really any background story about anyone. Sure we get very tiny hints about Robin’s but that’s it.The animation is really well done though some of is a tad to dark to see what was going on without lightening your screen.

Why did the script writers decide they were gonna back down just when the story gets interesting. Futhermore, the direction the anime was headed seemed like you were going to get a really epic sort of story, and the ending was just kind of not spectacular.

The plot and character development are interesting and draw you in, allowing you to overcome the somewhat less enticing art/ animation style.The anime is somewhat of a noir/ supernatural, though it is definitely more toned down than others. I'd say, for me, this is a very much character-driven story. Robin, the main character, is an interesting lead shrouded in mystery. She is not the typical weak main character, but she has plenty of room for growth. The side characters are interesting...though some could have definitely been more developed!

"", 'Witch Hunter Robin was a 2002 Sunrise anime. Yes, the same studio that brought us Gundam (the good and the bad), Code Geass, Dirty Pair and many more.Story:We open with a witch hunting organisation, STN-J, anticipating their new recruit. They quickly meet her, the titular Robin, as fire craft user with an improbable hair style. Which just proves that she’s the protagonist. From there, we watch as Robin and her team go up against witches of various kinds and bring them in. But there’s something amiss with STN-J. Where are they taking the witches they capture and what is this mysterious Orbo substance that...protects them from a witch’s powers?The biggest narrative problem with the series has to do with the set up. So, we’ve got these Seeds who are born with mysterious powers that may or may not awaken. If they awaken they’re either recruited by the Solomon organisation, STN-J’s parent company, or they’re hunted as witches. So, they’re basically Marvel mutants if the Xavier institute aggressively went after every mutant who didn’t join an X-team. The problem is, how did this organisation get formed and why do mutants join up with them instead of fighting back? We know Orbo is a new invention and that normal humans can’t use it without complications. That’s a major plot point. So, how exactly do they get people to cooperate with them? There’s never an explanation. It’s just the way it is. I guess their world needs a Magneto.On the positive side, the series is interesting. It has quite a few mysterious elements that get built up throughout and, ultimately, do have pretty satisfying conclusions. So, there is quite a bit of investment to be had. I also do appreciate the way a lot of early events that don’t seem particularly significant do ultimately play a more substantial role than you might think.Characters:This is where the series has its most significant problem. Namely, some of the major character dynamics come across as under-developed and contrived. You’ll have certain characters who show no interest in one another outside of business matters or where one does but the other doesn’t. Then the plot needs them to have a closer dynamic and they will as if by magic. Who knows, maybe a witch is manipulating the script. Probably the same witch who completely changed Squall’s characterisation in the last disc, except this series isn’t nearly that egregious. How interesting a character is also varies a lot. And this isn’t a series where the split is based on a character’s importance. You can have a major character like Amon who’s a bog standard, stick up his arse serious dude while some more secondary characters like Michael and Karasuma actually get complexity and some interesting traits.Art:Sunrise’s art in this has a fair few problems. First of all, the character expressions are frequently just vacant. Secondly, some of the action sequences can be really slow and even kind of tedious. With that out of the way, the series does have an interesting aesthetic and when they get their action sequences right, they’re really damn good.Sound:This is another element that varies a bit. They got a lot of talented people like Watanabe Akeno, Yuuki Hiro, Fukuyama Jun and others. But some of them, like Fukuyama, got saddled with dull characters while others, for narrative reasons, spend a lot of the series trying to sound unaffected, rather like they don’t care. Which doesn’t exactly lead to the most impactive performances. The musical score is pretty good.Ho-yay:There really isn’t any.Final Thoughts:Witch Hunter Robin has quite a few problems. As well as some things that could have been done better. That being said, it is an interesting series with enough strong characters to exonerate it, mostly, for the bland ones. If you want something with supernatural action, and you’ve already seen Yami No Matsuei, it’s a good choice. Final rating, 7/10.

Created by Sunrise Studio, the show tells the story of Robin Sena, a young girl with the ability to use magic, who is sent to Japan to join a secret organization that hunts witches. The show is set in an alternate universe where witches are real and can use their powers for both good and evil. The main character, Robin, is a witch herself, but works for the STN-J, an organization that uses the powers of witches to hunt down and eliminate other witches who pose a threat to society. Robin...is a ""craft user,"" meaning she has the power to manipulate fire, which she uses to capture and control other witches.The show\'s animation is a blend of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated imagery, which gives it a unique and visually striking look. The characters are well-designed and have distinct personalities and motivations, making it easy to get invested in their stories. The pacing of the show is deliberate and methodical, which may not be to everyone\'s taste. However, the slow build-up allows for more nuanced character development and a deeper exploration of the show\'s themes. The show also has a strong sense of atmosphere, with moody, atmospheric music and dark, shadowy visuals that create a sense of tension and unease.Overall, Witch Hunter Robin is a well-crafted, thought-provoking anime that explores complex themes and builds a detailed and immersive world. While the slow pacing and dark tone may not be for everyone, those who are willing to invest the time and attention will be rewarded with a rich and rewarding viewing experience. is a ""craft user,"" meaning she has the power to manipulate fire, which she uses to capture and control other witches.The show\'s animation is a blend of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated imagery, which gives it a unique and visually striking look.

Not to say that Witch Hunter Robin is bad by any stretch, it isn\'t, but the series needs to be with moderate expectations to be fully enjoyed.Set in a world where people with paranormal powers called Witches, or ""craft users"", who have been around for millennia, hiding from the rest of the world. For years, an organization called SOLOMON, run by priests set in Italy, has dedicated their time and effort into hunting down and killing...them, except for the Japanese branch, which captures them and put them away in a mysterious place called the ""Factory"".After the death of one of their hunters in the Japanese branch, SOLOMON dispatches a new hunter there, a 15-year old girl named Robin. Robin herself is a ""craft user"", raised by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy, specifically trained to hunt down other ""craft users"". But soon, she finds herself tied up in a situation more complicated and hidden than first thought.One of the worst things you can say about a series is that it had potential. The setup for the series is great, and it even has some depth to it, such as has having a moral grey area in which any of the characters ask if what they\'re doing is right. But the series has a few problems that prevent it from going from an OK series to a great series.The biggest problem is that the series end with a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger made worse by the fact that a sizeable chunk of this series are ""monster-of-the-week"" style episodes, where the witch hunters take down whatever witch is causing a problem that episode. The plot proper doesn\'t start until somewhere in the second half, but by then, it\'s a bit too late.As a result, lots of the plot and themes never really get fleshed out, and unlike a lot of anime, Witch Hunter Robin is not an adaptation of an already existing source material, so not even ""Just go read the manga"" excuse can be used here, because there is no more to this series.Witch Hunter Robin never really got popular enough to get another 13 episodes, and it\'s a shame, because right when it started to get interesting, the show ended with no resolution whatsoever. And this series could really use some closure. them, except for the Japanese branch, which captures them and put them away in a mysterious place called the ""Factory"".After the death of one of their hunters in the Japanese branch, SOLOMON dispatches a new hunter there, a 15-year old girl named Robin. Robin herself is a ""craft user"", raised by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy, specifically trained to hunt down other ""craft users"".

And this series could really use some closure.', 'Witch Hunter Robin is essentially an anime knock-off of La Femme Nikita, especially the TV show version of La Femme Nikita (the Pita Wilson show). The difference is that where La Femme Nikita is centered around an f-ed up independent spy organization that is cruel and abusive to it\'s members, Robin is about an f-ed up witch hunting organization that is cruel and abusive to it\'s members. But other than that, there\'s a lot of parallels. Essentially it features characters fighting and hunting down witches in a dark, f-ed up setting. The main characters work for an organization that is extremely shady, and essentially keeps...it\'s members trapped, in an f-ed up, abusive setting where they can\'t really leave and are forced to do horrible things or have horrible things done to them instead.If you\'ve seen the La Femme Nikita show, you\'ll see the blatant knock off right away.As far as the anime itself, it\'s really not that entertaining. It kind of drags on, and just features one dark episode after another, and you kind of end up feeling all depressed and kind of scummy afterwards.It kind of reminded me of RIN only without some of the pervy redeeming factors of RIN, or Gantz. It\'s one of those anime where you watch bad stuff happen to the main characters and when it\'s not happening to them, they\'re doing it to others.There are definitely other shows that I felt handled the ""we work for the evil assassin organization"" theme better. For example, Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom was genuinely very interesting because you see the strong connection between the two main characters and their bond in trying to help each other.In Witch Hunter Robin, I just felt it was dark and depressing and just didn\'t really draw me in. I just felt sorry for a lot of the characters, especially how Michael Lee is treated.It was just kind of dark, depressing, and gloomy. it\'s members trapped, in an f-ed up, abusive setting where they can\'t really leave and are forced to do horrible things or have horrible things done to them instead.If you\'ve seen the La Femme Nikita show, you\'ll see the blatant knock off right away.As far as the anime itself, it\'s really not that entertaining.

Brings back a lot of memories but anyway on with my review...Why I liked Witch Hunter Robin...1. It\'s dark, mysterious and calming all at the same time. (I have insomnia, so this is a plus.)2. The English Dub didn\'t make me want to commit suicide... or take a power drill to my temple.3. The art is fantastic.4. Dynamic characters and great character development.5. Worth watching over and over.6. Music is perfectly matched to the anime to set the mood.7. It started my ""obsession"" with anime... it\'s...gotta be good.8. The plot follows a steady pace right to the end... it doesn\'t jump around like some other animes I\'ve seen.Overall, it\'s a great anime with dynamic characters and an ever evolving plot. I was sad when I finished Witch Hunter Robin because there was no more, it made me one sad panda. :(This is my first review, be gentle. :) gotta be good.8.

The engrossing atmosphere drew me in, and the realistic art style is just the kind that I favour. But as the show progressed, it became obvious that it simply isn\'t as great as it first appeared, and I became less and less enamoured with it.""Witch Hunter Robin"" takes place in a modern world where magic is a thing and an organisation called STN hunts down magic-wielding witches, often with the help of magic-wielding ""craft users"". The show focuses on the Japan branch of STN, where a young craft user named...Robin becomes a latest member of the witching hunting team.""Witch Hunter Robin"" came out around the turn of the millennium. Like a typical TV anime of the era, the series ran for 26 episodes and has a structure which starts off mostly episodic, establishing the settings and characters etc, but transitions to a second half more focused on a central plot. I found the standalone episodes quite enjoyable, but the second half disappointed me a little. Not because it became terrible, but because I expected the story to kick into a more exciting gear like other anime that followed a similar formula. With ""Witch Hunter Robin"", I didn\'t think the second half got much better than the first: the more substantial plot, while interesting, didn\'t quite reel me in, and I felt it told the internal political conflicts in a rather confusing manner.The world building is also quite confusing. The story of ""Witch Hunter Robin"" features some intriguing parallels between craft users and witches, raising questions around why society accepts the former but not the latter. However, the effectiveness of the concept gets blunted by the anime\'s reluctance go into details about the difference in classifications. As a result, you can read reviews written by three different reviewers and find three different understandings for something that should have been easy to clarify.One of my favourites parts of ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is the action. The battles can be quite flashy and tense, and the animation seems to excel particularly when the action involves flames. I wouldn\'t say the anime counts as an action-heavy show though, and part of me wishes it were. The battles tend to be short-lived affairs; outside of that, the plodding sense of mystery forms the main draw, but one that didn\'t engage me as much. The ending in particular failed to draw much of a reaction out of me, despite what seemed like an attempt to do something out of the ordinary.I think the main reason I couldn\'t engage with the story more is the characters. I\'m very much a character-oriented person when consuming stories, and ""Witch Hunter Robin"" disappointed in this aspect. While initially appealing, many of the characters don\'t get much development, and for the ones that do, the development sometimes feel stilted, their changing attitudes coming across as overly-sudden or out of character.I do love the character designs of ""Witch Hunter Robin"" though. In a break from most other anime, the series goes for a more life-like look for the characters and for the most part pulls it off in style. Goofy anime staples such as super deformity and exaggerated expressions are nowhere to be found, which sits just fine with me. The designs also strikes me as distinctive, especially the titular character\'s hairdo. One minor grumble I have is the occasional stiffness in the characters\' expressions, particularly around the mouth, although I suspect the only reason it\'s noticeable is because of the anime\'s realistic style. The characters\' wardrobes frequently feature long, shadowy trench coats, and the anime\'s colour pallet consists of mostly dreary shades of dark and grey which complements the sombre atmosphere nicely.That said, while the anime does ""dark and gloomy"" well, it falls over whenever it tries to lighten the mood. The humour in the show sucks particularly bad. The dry deliverance of flat punchlines results in jokes that are hard to pick up. The show does have some funny moments, but I found myself wondering whether the writers even meant them. For example, one of the characters cocks up so many times it\'s like a running joke, but the show itself doesn\'t seem aware of the joke.The last complaint I have is regarding the music: I rarely complain about the music of a show because it\'s generally adequate. However, the music of ""Witch Hunter Robin"" is noticeably bad. The opening doesn\'t fit the mood; the background tracks are bland and not particularly pleasing to the ear; the ending track is okay until the singer tries to sing in English, and sings it so badly that I didn\'t realise the ""English"" parts existed until most of the way through the series.But despite all my misgivings, I\'d still count ""Witch Hunter Robin"" as a good anime. The show comes off as refreshingly dignified and mature without resorting to the ""edgy and violent"" shortcut that some other anime take. While I don\'t see myself revisiting the series, I enjoyed it well enough as I was watching. I guess I\'m simply disappointed that, after such a promising start, ""Witch Hunter Robin"" didn\'t end up as anything better than just plain old ""good"".Personal rating: +1.0 (good) Robin becomes a latest member of the witching hunting team.""Witch Hunter Robin"" came out around the turn of the millennium.

And so the difficulties begin.I have procrastinated on this anime because the show has so many elements, with so many impinging aspects; it is difficult to do a good review of it, while doing its’ creators and artists proper justice.I will be deviating from my normal loose-form review, and will do this in the sectioned-off form that some think is a requirement (it...is not) in an attempt to give as many people and production characteristics as much proper light and credit as possible.—————————————————————————————My God! Where do I begin? I think I will give my thoughts, listed in the standard MAL Categorized Ratings; with sidelights; and then will present a more generalized discussion.1). Story-10WHR (as this anime’ fans like to call it), is for many of the characters; a voyage of self-discovery and maturation. While it focuses on certain primary characters, the entire cast of characters take on their tasks and their own lives, in a process of personal growth.The primary protagonist is Robin Sena, and while early on, not the most important character; becomes the “Eye of the Malestrom” as the story progresses, for every other character.Not only does all the characters have fleshed out ordinary lives, when they are not at work; at work they try to hold onto some kind of sanity, doing a difficult job that forces most of them to become (quite literally) judge, jury and executioner for a whole class of people that fall under their jurisdiction.These are the “Hunters”. Their prey are misbegotten misfits called “Witches”. The Witches are not “witches” in the traditional sense, but are ESP-types, everything from telekinetics, to mind-reader-types, to long-lived, and several others that defy classification.The Witches are hunted down by the STN, and the more local STNJ; as a means of protecting the public. This is necessary since the legal channels, and the courts will not recognize the supernatural means employed by the Witches in the performance of various crimes and misdeeds.As the story evolves, we find that the STN (Solomon Technologies Network) have been hunting down the Witches for centuries, without remorse (STN has had various other names though the centuries). Today, the STN has connections with many Law Enforcement and Religious Centers around the Globe, and assist in the identification, tracking, and elimination of the Witches.The assumption is always that the Witches are always bad and must be eliminated. And most of the time, they are right. The ESP-powers they employ, apparently is linked to genetic changes in the people that have these talents in such a fashion that almost always results in criminal or anti-social behavior. And the fact that sometimes, just occasionally; once in while we get one that IS sane, and can be Trusted in society is (for the STN) totally irrelevant.And THAT brings us to the inhabitants of the STNJ, and more properly to a very young 15-year old girl named Robin Sena; who was educated mostly by the STN, trained by the STN, sent to the STNJ (Japanese branch) by the STN; and ordered to destroy Witches whenever possible to lend assistance to her new partners.Eventually, the entire STNJ become increasingly aware that the STN hatred of all things Witch, is deeply rooted in a power play, because the managers of the STN (being Witches themselves) are trying to eliminate the competition. Eventually, this fact places the STN at complete and total odds with Robin Sena herself, and anyone else who aids or comforts her.This leads the STN to a situation that finds them tracking down Robin Sena like an animal. As they see her increasingly as a threat to their hegemony.This is just the beginnings of an outline for the story. For those that like a detective story with bite, and angst; this is must-watch, to get to the end of the tale.—2). Art-9Sunrise, Inc. did the art for WHR, and is renown for many other anime that have won awards. Shows like: Gundam, Armored Trooper Votoms, Yoroiden Samurai Troopers, Crush Gear Turbo, The Vision of Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, My-HiME, My-Otome, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, Tiger & Bunny, Valvrave the Liberator; and many others.Witch Hunter Robin stands in good company with some of the best, most innovative artwork in any anime, anywhere. While many anime try to be bright, colorful and cheery; Witch Hunter Robin is dark, somber, gritty. Action scenes are handled deftly, character actions and reactions are shown as one would think of real people, not cartoons.The artwork focuses a lot, upon the nature of the panoply of real people thrust into emotionally difficult and stressful situations. Even the thought of personal loss, confusion, and sustained levels of fear; for several characters, is handled in a manner unknown to other anime of the period when WHR was made (2002).One example, just to save space, to illustrate:Robin Sena, at one point in the story, having been pursued for months, not knowing how her friends are faring, hiding in plain sight; tired, worried and alone. Finally having an extreme anxiety attack, and in one of the most poignant sadnesses in the story, Robin washes her face, dries it, stares at herself in the mirror of her hideout; then collapses to her knees on the floor and breaks down in a crying fit. We can see her fear, the tears on her face, and the shoulders shaking in heartfelt emotion.And we cry with her.---3). Sound-10VOICESI want to save the best for last, so I’ll talk about the wonderful voice actors. The voice actors, both the Japanese and the English speaking, were carefully chosen. Many of these voices you will recognize, from other anime:Japanese: Takuma Takawaka, Kyoko Hikami, Kaho Kouda, Hiro Yuuki, Jun Fukuyama, Akeno Watanabe, Jin Yamanoi, Michiro Ikemizu; and others.English: Crispin Freeman, Michelle Ruff, Wendee Lee, Dave Wittenberg, Johnny Yong Bosch, Kari Wahlgren, Jamieson Price; and others.I have watched WHR in both languages, and the show works very well, in both languages. All the characters, did an excellent job of empathizing their characters properly, putting the right tone to almost every line. Handling the emotional range with subtleties not often seen in other anime.MUSIC!As I said, I wanted to talk about the Music last. The music was composed and choreographed by only one 22-year old fellow, named Taku Iwasaki. Graduated from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, and is comparable to Juliard in the United States.Mr. Iwasaki created 48 pieces of music for WHR, each one keyed to almost every scene. It is so good, that a pair of CD’s were issued for commercial purchase. I have these albums, and they are superb!He is still doing anime soundtrack work, to this day. His music can be heard in: R.O.D.-Read or Die-, Black Cat, Angel Heart, 009-1, Gurren Lagann, Katanagatari; and dozens of others.He did a movie called, Origin: Spirits of the PastAnd Mr. Iwasaki also does music for video games: Uncharted Waters-Online, Muv-Luv Alternative; and several others.In short, Taku Iwasaki stands as one of the best anime composers in the last 30-years. His music for Witch Hunter Robin stands so clearly, it can stand alone without the anime; for all time. It is a triumph I hope he continues to match with his future work.—4). CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT-10As I’ve said earlier, WHR is about the evolution of the characters. The character development shows us, as WHR progresses; the character transitions from what we see in the beginning, to each of the end characters.Some start out as professionals, that know what they are doing, descending to monsters. Others start out as neophytes that know almost nothing, and end up the linchpins within the framework of their associations.I want to talk a little about a couple of these characters:Robin Sena.This character is 15-years old, knows only what she has been taught. Is a powerful Firestarter. And as she progresses, her voyage of discovery uncovers a mental giant, with a heart of gold. By the end of the story, she becomes the strongest Witch in the World, and can stand against any other; and survive. There is a scene towards the end of the story, that indicates her personal growth:Robin has been marked for death by the STN. But before this can take place, the grandfather, who raised her, comes to see her for what he believes will be the last time. He is a prominent Catholic Priest, who has been working with the STN for decades. But he comes in truce, to speak to his granddaughter.He allows her to ask any question, resolving to answer all of them honestly. He felt he owed her that much. They talked together, for some hours; the conversation moving between heartfelt affection between family members, to mutual accusations and recriminations.Finally, the conversation rolls unerringly to the climax of Robins’ concerns. The stress is noticeable and palpable. She asks her grandfather to confirm her terrible suspicions, about her own origins; and in those moments she is faced with the deadly, dark secrets that define who and what she is. The enormous terror of her realization that she should never have been born; that she herself is an abomination even in her own mind.But in those moments, she is able to reconcile the meaning of her Life, and find a reason to stay alive. She even discovers that in the death-throws of her own mother, the words from her, to Robin’s grandfather were; “… take care of my Hope, the Hope of the World …”. In  those moments, which could have ended with her sanity shattered; became her triumph, as she found new vigor and purpose.Takuma ZaizenThis fellow is a professional manager for the STNJ office at “Raven’s Flat”. Reliable, exacting, fair-minded, and dignified; wasting few words, and expecting good work from all his subordinates.When he is not at work, he has a self-made side-job; managing a research lab which produces a weapon used by his ‘Hunters’ in combat against the numerous Witches they encounter.By the end of the story; the shock of the realization that Robin Sena and the entire STNJ is in open revolt against everything he stands for (which is preservation of his kind of Human Life); brings him to outright Madness. Finally attempting to use his own super-weapon against Robin, the chemical it is made from reduces him to extreme insanity. Robin is forced to destroy him in an elevator shaft as he attempts to escape; as a kindness. He is barbecued in one of her signature firebomb explosions. She is revolted by the events of the day.—5). Enjoyment-10Witch Hunter Robin, is a rare gem.While many reviewers decried its slow pacing, for over half of the episodes; they missed the high powered payoff at the end. Some of these same reviewers critique other anime, ecchi or harem (or both), because the characters are lackluster, having little depth.This sort of rational disconnect is built around two things; a desire for instant gratification, and another desire to have a high degree of depth in the anime some reviewers are viewing. In other words, most people want three-dimensional characters, a great story, excellent music, and they want the story to be over in 10 episodes or less. Who wants to waste time?In the end, Witch Hunter Robin isn’t about action (which it has), isn’t about science fiction (it has some), and isn’t about sexual-hentai behavior (it has none).What this story is about is people. Three-dimensional people, with real lives, and real friends, and real enemies. To tell a anime story about people cannot ever be done well; quickly. It takes time, and events, and the reactions to those events; so that we can take the measure of each character, and see into the minds and hearts; of men and women.That means that Witch Hunter Robin is intended for the thinking individuals among us; who are willing to learn about and empathize with the characters. Those of us who cannot be bothered to do that, will never be able to find pleasure in anything that needs to grow and ripen, and finally become the triumph that only that process can yield.I re-watch Witch Hunter Robin at least once a year. It is always spectacular, pleasing my sensibilities every time. Everything in this anime has cohesion, and faith to a central ideal. It is a rare pleasure to whole-heartedly endorse Witch Hunter Robin.I give this anime a solid 10! is not) in an attempt to give as many people and production characteristics as much proper light and credit as possible.—————————————————————————————My God!

It is so good, that a pair of CD’s were issued for commercial purchase. I have these albums, and they are superb!He is still doing anime soundtrack work, to this day. His music can be heard in: R.O.D.-Read or Die-, Black Cat, Angel Heart, 009-1, Gurren Lagann, Katanagatari; and dozens of others.He did a movie called, Origin: Spirits of the PastAnd Mr. Iwasaki also does music for video games: Uncharted Waters-Online, Muv-Luv Alternative; and several others.In short, Taku Iwasaki stands as one of the best anime composers in the last 30-years. His music for Witch Hunter Robin stands so clearly, it can stand alone without the anime; for all time. It is a triumph I hope he continues to match with his future work.—4). CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT-10As I’ve said earlier, WHR is about the evolution of the characters. The character development shows us, as WHR progresses; the character transitions from what we see in the beginning, to each of the end characters.Some start out as professionals, that know what they are doing, descending to monsters. Others start out as neophytes that know almost nothing, and end up the linchpins within the framework of their associations.I want to talk a little about a couple of these characters:Robin Sena.This character is 15-years old, knows only what she has been taught. Is a powerful Firestarter. And as she progresses, her voyage of discovery uncovers a mental giant, with a heart of gold. By the end of the story, she becomes the strongest Witch in the World, and can stand against any other; and survive. There is a scene towards the end of the story, that indicates her personal growth:Robin has been marked for death by the STN. But before this can take place, the grandfather, who raised her, comes to see her for what he believes will be the last time. He is a prominent Catholic Priest, who has been working with the STN for decades. But he comes in truce, to speak to his granddaughter.He allows her to ask any question, resolving to answer all of them honestly. He felt he owed her that much. They talked together, for some hours; the conversation moving between heartfelt affection between family members, to mutual accusations and recriminations.Finally, the conversation rolls unerringly to the climax of Robins’ concerns. The stress is noticeable and palpable. She asks her grandfather to confirm her terrible suspicions, about her own origins; and in those moments she is faced with the deadly, dark secrets that define who and what she is. The enormous terror of her realization that she should never have been born; that she herself is an abomination even in her own mind.But in those moments, she is able to reconcile the meaning of her Life, and find a reason to stay alive. She even discovers that in the death-throws of her own mother, the words from her, to Robin’s grandfather were; “… take care of my Hope, the Hope of the World …”. In  those moments, which could have ended with her sanity shattered; became her triumph, as she found new vigor and purpose.Takuma ZaizenThis fellow is a professional manager for the STNJ office at “Raven’s Flat”. Reliable, exacting, fair-minded, and dignified; wasting few words, and expecting good work from all his subordinates.When he is not at work, he has a self-made side-job; managing a research lab which produces a weapon used by his ‘Hunters’ in combat against the numerous Witches they encounter.By the end of the story; the shock of the realization that Robin Sena and the entire STNJ is in open revolt against everything he stands for (which is preservation of his kind of Human Life); brings him to outright Madness. Finally attempting to use his own super-weapon against Robin, the chemical it is made from reduces him to extreme insanity. Robin is forced to destroy him in an elevator shaft as he attempts to escape; as a kindness. He is barbecued in one of her signature firebomb explosions. She is revolted by the events of the day.—5). Enjoyment-10Witch Hunter Robin, is a rare gem.While many reviewers decried its slow pacing, for over half of the episodes; they missed the high powered payoff at the end. Some of these same reviewers critique other anime, ecchi or harem (or both), because the characters are lackluster, having little depth.This sort of rational disconnect is built around two things; a desire for instant gratification, and another desire to have a high degree of depth in the anime some reviewers are viewing. In other words, most people want three-dimensional characters, a great story, excellent music, and they want the story to be over in 10 episodes or less. Who wants to waste time?In the end, Witch Hunter Robin isn’t about action (which it has), isn’t about science fiction (it has some), and isn’t about sexual-hentai behavior (it has none).What this story is about is people. Three-dimensional people, with real lives, and real friends, and real enemies. To tell a anime story about people cannot ever be done well; quickly. It takes time, and events, and the reactions to those events; so that we can take the measure of each character, and see into the minds and hearts; of men and women.That means that Witch Hunter Robin is intended for the thinking individuals among us; who are willing to learn about and empathize with the characters. Those of us who cannot be bothered to do that, will never be able to find pleasure in anything that needs to grow and ripen, and finally become the triumph that only that process can yield.I re-watch Witch Hunter Robin at least once a year. It is always spectacular, pleasing my sensibilities every time. Everything in this anime has cohesion, and faith to a central ideal. It is a rare pleasure to whole-heartedly endorse Witch Hunter Robin.I give this anime a solid 10!', 'I watched WHR when it first came out in 2002 and I loved the living crap out of it even though I don\'t think I understood a lot of the seemingly intricate plot. I recently rewatched it and figured it was about time I reviewed it. You can read my summary for the TL;DR version or scroll below to read it in depth.---Summary:WHR\'s Monster-of-the-week approach was, I believe, apt for the time it was released as that was the trend of the season. Everyone seemed to be doing it. But I believe WHR used the trend with stylistic and emphatic intention as it simply fortifies...the idea that the hunters simply hunted in ignorance in contrast to the second half of the show when their actions all come under light. That being said, I believe even back in 2002, I thought the first 13 episodes tended to be boorishly slow. Slow pan-scapes of characters simply walking across the screen was painful but one could argue that it was how the creators intended to build tension. If you can get past those painfully slow pans, the characters are refreshing and intriguing. WHR is one of the rare anime that I didn\'t hate a single character; not even the antagonists. I believed every single one of their motivations and the decisions they made were completely in character. A second downside to WHR as well, are the references to various occult themes without any clarification on seemingly crucial plot devices. Aka the \'secret of the craft\' or what have you. I can\'t even call it a spoiler because to date I don\'t understand what it is that Robin discovered. That was tied in with various other story arcs with Solomon and STN-J moving in conjunction in various directions so I think its importance as well as its existence got washed under the bridge except for the fact that Robin kept repeating that she \'discovered\' the secret, or the arcane or whatever the hell that was.Plot review:The plot was immensely interesting but i think overall could be executed better. I think it most certainly requires a re-watch to catch some key plot points which go past you so quickly, you don\'t realize what just happened. Yet the slow parts are so excruciatingly slow that when the action picks up, you\'re just really not paying attention when important things happen. I don\'t mind the monster-of-the-week approach at first either simply because it makes me nostalgic lol. As I noted above with various plot devices getting all muddled up in between several other story arcs occurring at the same time, was one of my biggest gripes about how the plot was executed. However, things get tied up quite well, even with the open ending, I think.Character review:I loved all the characters. When I first watched it in 2002, I have no idea why I was under the impression that it was more of a romance than it actually is. Then again, I was 16 at the time. The entire Robin x Amon dynamic is super interesting as he takes on the role of a partner, but also a protector and a quasi-father-figure. The romance is hinted at and tbph, I wouldn\'t be surprised if they ended up making Witch-babies together. Even with the 10 year difference and Amon being hot and cold about Robin, I think their pseudo-romance was even sweeter because their level of trust in each other seemed to supersede the formalities of ""romance"". Robin made Amon re-evaluate his stance not just on Witches but himself. But anyway, all this is implied through how they re-act to each other so I\'m just shipping them at this point. Robin\'s interactions with the other characters, down to the security guard is stellar. It\'s not forced and she develops as a character through the most mundane of her relationships. From the ever-silent guy that works for Nagira to Zaizen, whom she barely makes contact with.Zaizen on the other hand is an excellent antagonist. I do wish he had _a little more_ depth to him in terms of establishing a moral compass. We know he loves Touko but is not past using her as bait. So what? where does that leave him as an antagonist? In the end he is just painted with the ""bad guy"" brush which is fine, but I guess I just have a thing for emotionally complex antagonists lol.Art, Animation & Music Review:This anime was made in 2002. I thought it was absolutely flawless when I was 16 lol. Needless to say, the animation is janky and I noted several scenes where I could almost count the frames in between. That being said, the art style is far more stylistic than most new anime possibly because of having being hand-drawn. I think the moody, gothic style is quite apt without becoming oppressive. I find the steampunk elements quite pleasing as well.Robin\'s character design is absolutely beautiful as are the others. I even love her alternative costumes (the waitress uniform she wears at Harry\'s!)The music is absolutely stunning. I loved how well it complimented the show and even crucial plot moments are heightened simply because of how incredible the score was. In fact, I think the immersive quality of the music was how I was able to overcome the janky animation when I re-watched it. the idea that the hunters simply hunted in ignorance in contrast to the second half of the show when their actions all come under light.

And that they been hunted for centuries, and still was hunted because of peoples fear of their powers with the help of other witches.  And that those hunting witches mostly hunt other witches in their own fear to become hunted them self. That is a huge part of the show “Witch Hunter Robin” (WHR). It´s of course more complicated than that, but I find that being an important part of the show.I can definitely understand that WHR, is not for everyone. The world building, the pacing, and the development of the characters are a bit on the slow...side. WHR also doesn´t contain a lot of neck-breaking speed action, classical huge anime eyes and vivid colours, exaggerated facial and body expressions, or the outburst of intense emotions. So, if you can´t coop with that in a show, WHR is most likely not for you. But, if you are on the more patient side and enjoying looking a bit deeper into a show, this is likely a show for you. Because, WHR is what I would call a “old” classic with its darker theme, way of narrative, and animation.Why I liked WHR so much that I gave the show an 8? I will elaborate that now.Story: 8/10The story follows the people working for the organisation STN-J located in Japan. STN-J is a branch organisation that does things a little bit differently than their sister and mother organisations. They hunt down witches that gone mad of their powers, or just decided to use their powers for crime, and instead of killing them they capture them alive. Well captured, the witches are shipped to a facility called “the factory”, and no one at STN-J really know what´s happening to the witches there. The humans take the help of other witches’ powers (or craft users as the non-hunted witches are called), who are called hunters. These hunters are knowing that if their powers are to fully awaken, and they become a threat to the organisation, they will be hunted down to. Several individuals at the STN-J are craft users, and are used as hunters. The STN-J are the only branch that uses what´s called “the Orbos”, a liquid tool that makes them pretty much immune to a regular witch powers.Robin is 15-year old girl who grow up in Europe. She is a craft user, and has been brought up as a witch hunter to work for human organisations as the STN. Robin arrives in Japan as replacement for a hunter at STN-J, that was killed 6 months prior to this story. Well there she is partnered up with Amon, a very serious and brooding man in his late 20´s. At first, he is doing his best to avoid Robin and are quite harsh with her. But during time and several missions, a mutual trust starts to develop between them. Robin also starts to get know and trust her other colleagues, and starts to build a life for herself at this new place.But things are starting to move in the shadows, and the crew at the STN-J are dragged into someone´s plan to change this world for good, and the people responsible are much closer to them then they thought possible.I must say that I quite enjoyed the story. The “real” plot isn´t kicking in until midways, but I think I can see a reason for it. The first half of the show is very episodic. Each of them involves the STN-J´s crew and Robin solving cases (mostly murders), connected to witches, and to catch them. I think they choose to do so to let Robin interact with her new colleagues, to establish her relationships with them. Because that is quite important for the latter half, because almost no one would help and do so risky things for someone they almost didn´t know or trust. Robin becoming one trusted and liked friend and colleague was essential for the “main” plot. I actually enjoyed these episodes quite a lot, it was like watching a supernatural cop show, with some personal and relationship stuff little bit on the side.With that said, it raises some necessary questions, and some thoughts about ethic and morals. Is it really ok to hunt down or oppress innocent just because you are afraid of their powers, and that they may use them against you? Isn´t that just a way to create criminals and outlaws? If I´m personally was hunted for reasons that was out of my hands, I would use that power to defend myself and in worst case take vengeance on my hunters/oppressors. Yes, most of the witches that´s being hunted in the show has done awful things, but surrounding stories and such are told about the craft users fear of their powers and the humans that is keeping track of them. Because databases with descended witches and their relatives are kept, and those who may have the “power” (called seeds) are closely watched. If their powers are awakened, it’s a big possibility that they are killed or captured even before they even done something wrong. I would call that use of information and military tactic for oppression and grave mistreatment. Witches aren´t even looked upon as humans, they are something beneath humanity. Something the craft users that work for STN are highly aware of. All this felt necessary to latter half of the show, where the characters had to choose what kind of person they wanted to be.In many stories can elements within the show just to be there, for there reason to be there. Such is not the case in WHR. For, example the “Orbos”. In the first half of the show I started to ask myself some questions. Like, why are the STN-J branch the only ones that have these “Orbos”. They doesn´t know them self what the Orbos really is. What is happen to the witches that they captured? Do they end up in some special kind of witch jail? WHR gave me all the answers, and this happened to be an important part of the story.Art: 7/10WHR is an anime original made by studio Sunrise 2002. The overall atmosphere is dark and down toned, and little bit gothic. Which I think suites the story and its characters very well. The typical anime bright colours are absent, instead are more earthy colours used. The show reminded me of “Monster” in its colorization and character designs – all over more realistic looking. Most of the characters aren´t super pretty looking, and they are more realistic showcased – no exaggerated body parts and such. Robin are 15, and doesn´t look anime 15, but like a premature human 15-year-old.The characters can look a little bit of in some angles and zoomed out panels, but for the most time they look ok. And just in like shows such as “Monster” or “Ghost in the Shell: SAC”, the character’s movements are much slower and less intense than in your usual anime. It’s can take some time to adjust to, but after a while it becomes one with the show. But the magic action scenes are actually quite intense – objects flying around, fire that obliterate anything in its path, cascade winds blowing people away, bullets that is caught in mid-air. They are pretty inventive in their fighting styles, which was very entertaining to see. Each witch with his or her unique elemental specialty and power level. Sunrise has managed to portray that very well for the year WHR was made.Backgrounds are actually very detailed. It´s creating a very believable atmosphere, and produces a perfect mood for the story of WHR. All the cables to the electronic, the runes of the magical circles, the guns and technology, and office environments are example of details that help set the mood in a specific scene.Sound: 7/10The OP is a nice work called “Shell” done by Bana, and I grow to enjoy it very much during the watch. If you like the visuals or not, is something of personal taste. By the time I got to know the show and its characters, I started to enjoy it quite a lot. By 2/3 of the show, I really got the message behind it. The ED is a slower piece, which liked but never really felt to yam with.The overall soundtrack is a lot of lounge bar music, with piano and other down toned instruments. It became a part of the all atmosphere of WHR. A little more intense music was used in more action- or serious scenes.I watched the dubbed version and liked it a lot. I think that they matched the character with suiting VA in most cases. VA´s such as Johnny Yong Bosch who done the voice to Ichigo Kurusaki, Izaya Orihara and Kiba for example, and Michelle Ruff who done the voice to Rukia Kuchiki, Euphemia il Britannia, Shino Asada to mention some, are voicing two of the main supporting characters. I found that most of the VA´s had found the core of their characters, and highlighted their personality. At first Robin´s VA can come off as very emotionless, but she actually fits Robin´s personality very well.Character: 8/10WHR has a very unique set up of characters. They really appear human to me, with their way of being and reasoning. They develop through the show like any other human I know would, no personality changes but some pieces and bits that the character learned from his or her experiences. They have specific and defined character traits without being any kind of archetypes. Robin, Amon and their colleagues all feel like their own persons, with ambitions, quirks, talents, feelings, believes, weaknesses and hopes. And I think they manage to portray friendship, trust and humanity in were discrete and elegant way. It´s slowly becomes present, without the character screaming out their message. Their actions speak so much more than what they not saying out load to each other. I thought it was quite touching. A lot of the character’s feelings aren´t that verbally expressed, so an exchange of eye contact could be very important to grasp what the characters might be feeling or thinking.Robin is a very special kind of main girl character. She is very calm, collected and logical. Absolutely the most mature 15-year old female lead I ever witnessed. She doesn´t have immature outburst of heated emotions, she´s taking her job very seriously, and reason like an adult. It´s only a few times that I was reminded of her real age, and then so in a very heart clenching way.The supporting characters felt just as important as Robin or Amon. They build up a well-oiled, dynamic team there all the characters are an important part of the machinery – both in a practical way in a relationship wise way. Its take a little bit of time to getting know the characters and their specific ways of being, but after they really grow on you with their way to put their minds together over a case, teasing each other, or lecture each other. It felt very natural and real.Enjoyment: 8/10I went into WHR with little to no expectations, and the show grow on me with each episode. I just sat there and let the show take me with it. So even if the first half is episodic, each episode taught me more about the witches, their powers, the social dynamic, the character and their traits, and how the STN-J worked. And then the more emotional and even darker second half started I started to bench watch it, and the show had become very enjoying for me.Overall: 8/10As I mentioned in the beginning, WHR is definitely not everyone and anyone. It demands a specific kind of audience, and that you have at least a little bit of patience. Because at first glance the story and the character can look really flat, but are really much deeper than in your regular anime. I enjoyed the story and its characters, and appreciated the underlying messages and thought the show provided. I will label this one a “classic” and use it for future references. Absolutely worth the watch to me.Hope you find this review helpful or somewhat informative. Kippis! side. WHR also doesn´t contain a lot of neck-breaking speed action, classical huge anime eyes and vivid colours, exaggerated facial and body expressions, or the outburst of intense emotions. So, if you can´t coop with that in a show, WHR is most likely not for you. But, if you are on the more patient side and enjoying looking a bit deeper into a show, this is likely a show for you.

They really appear human to me, with their way of being and reasoning. They develop through the show like any other human I know would, no personality changes but some pieces and bits that the character learned from his or her experiences. They have specific and defined character traits without being any kind of archetypes. Robin, Amon and their colleagues all feel like their own persons, with ambitions, quirks, talents, feelings, believes, weaknesses and hopes. And I think they manage to portray friendship, trust and humanity in were discrete and elegant way. It´s slowly becomes present, without the character screaming out their message. Their actions speak so much more than what they not saying out load to each other. I thought it was quite touching. A lot of the character’s feelings aren´t that verbally expressed, so an exchange of eye contact could be very important to grasp what the characters might be feeling or thinking.Robin is a very special kind of main girl character. She is very calm, collected and logical. Absolutely the most mature 15-year old female lead I ever witnessed. She doesn´t have immature outburst of heated emotions, she´s taking her job very seriously, and reason like an adult. It´s only a few times that I was reminded of her real age, and then so in a very heart clenching way.The supporting characters felt just as important as Robin or Amon. They build up a well-oiled, dynamic team there all the characters are an important part of the machinery – both in a practical way in a relationship wise way. Its take a little bit of time to getting know the characters and their specific ways of being, but after they really grow on you with their way to put their minds together over a case, teasing each other, or lecture each other. It felt very natural and real.Enjoyment: 8/10I went into WHR with little to no expectations, and the show grow on me with each episode. I just sat there and let the show take me with it. So even if the first half is episodic, each episode taught me more about the witches, their powers, the social dynamic, the character and their traits, and how the STN-J worked. And then the more emotional and even darker second half started I started to bench watch it, and the show had become very enjoying for me.Overall: 8/10As I mentioned in the beginning, WHR is definitely not everyone and anyone. It demands a specific kind of audience, and that you have at least a little bit of patience. Because at first glance the story and the character can look really flat, but are really much deeper than in your regular anime. I enjoyed the story and its characters, and appreciated the underlying messages and thought the show provided. I will label this one a “classic” and use it for future references. Absolutely worth the watch to me.Hope you find this review helpful or somewhat informative. Kippis!', ""Witch Hunter Robin is a bit of an odd series. I liked it despite the crawling plot, simply because the ''feel'' it had was unique. It was definitely something more laid-back to watch, as opposed to some series where you're excited and desperately want to watch the next episode.Story: 7Why doesn't it get a higher rating on story? Mainly because the plot progresses at a very slow pace for the first half of the series. There are quite a few mysteries and questions that take a while to get answered, but they aren't as surprising as one might hope. It's decent enough, but nothing truly...shocking or exciting.Art: 7The artstyle is somewhat plain, but does a good job of conveying the dark, mysterious atmosphere of the series. It is not fancy by any means, and strives for somewhat realistic proportions. All in all, a refreshing take as far as anime styles go.Sound: 8The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. It's subtle, and at times either haunting or very atmospheric. Not a typical or generic feel to it, and matches the series very well in tone. It meshes well with the nature of the plot and the artstyle.Character: 7The characters were somewhat cliché, but realistic enough to not become caricatures. Again, the way the characters behave match the feeling the series is going for, with few overly outgoing hotheads rushing out into danger. I am especially fond of the somewhat shy and withdrawn main character that still manages to have a personality of her own, driven by her search for answers.Enjoyment: 7Although I was not particularly driven to watch the series, it had this ''pull'' that made me want to watch it nonetheless. There are few series out there with this kind of atmosphere, so that was a nice change of pace. I mostly watched it while eating dinner with my partner, and the series was suitable for discussing the events and world of the anime during and after each episode. I definitely enjoyed watching it.Total: 8Looking back I remember little of the actual plot, but I think back on the atmosphere and setting fondly. All the above factors pulled me in despite its flaws, and I'm happy to have watched it. shocking or exciting.Art: 7The artstyle is somewhat plain, but does a good job of conveying the dark, mysterious atmosphere of the series.

The show seems to heavily prioritize mood over all else, with its restrained and realistic acting and reasonably (for anime, at least) grounded setting. However, it seems to do so at the expense of the story and characters, overall.The story is unfocused. Plot points are routinely set up, given zero time to breathe, and then get unceremoniously dumped. A prime example is early on, when the show introduces the question of why Robin\'s powers seem...to be unable to ever hit their target. I had thought that maybe the show was setting up how, like most teenage girls, Robin maybe had some unconscious qualms about lighting people on fire with her mind, and she would have to grow into the role of witch-hunter that was forced on her. Instead, it turns out that she just needs glasses, which is weird, because that\'s not how vision works. This is a problem that\'s shown off in episode one, questioned in the second, solved in the third, and no longer a problem by the fourth.This is a recurring theme with just about every plot the show has. Half-hearted attempts are made to suggest that Robin has a hard time grasping idioms, because she\'s foreign, but at a frequency that makes me forget that that\'s even supposed to be a thing. Amon\'s relationship with his girlfriend consists of two scenes of them emphatically not having chemistry before Amon does the whole breakup by phone bit. The end of the show raises the stakes by introducing an army of mass-deployed black ops soldiers, only to render them completely irrelevant by making their one weakness ""being in Robin\'s presence for more than ten seconds."" And the very end of the show turns an established character into a rambling idiot, spouting some asinine screed about ""the purity of the human race"" that couldn\'t be any more stereotypically ""this particular period of anime history"" if it tried.The muted performance of the characters, while a welcome sight in a genre marked by unfunny mugging, goes a bit too far. Characters all seem to have to make a conscious decision to show a genuine character trait, otherwise defaulting to low-key, neutral expression, no-emotion fact spewing that makes them seem like they\'re engaged in a constant contest of ""who can look the coolest?"" I found myself liking characters like Dojima and That One Guy on the Motorcycle that Doesn\'t Do Anything Important, because at least they knew how to crack a smile every now and again.Overall, WHR is a well-presented, but otherwise vacuous series. If it was perhaps a bit longer, maybe some of these plot points could have actually been given the attention they deserved. As it stands, it strikes me as a show with too many ideas and no firm way to bridge them all together. Still, I was entertained, at least enough to finish it, so I could certainly say it had room to get worse. to be unable to ever hit their target.

The series follows a team of ""hunters"" who use their power (""craft"") to track and capture witches humanely rather than using the old-skool method of killing them (think Salem witch trials).Enter Robin, a 15 year old (who looks and acts 30) who is sent to replace the previous hunter who died months prior. Robin struggles with her sense of self and acceptance of her own powers. As the series progresses, it becomes less and less certain if she is hunting or being hunted.While there are some decent surprises thrown...in, the execution is lackluster and anticlimactic. Robin is such a bland character that it isn\'t easy to really care that much what happens to her. Her complete lack of emotion makes it impossibly to identify with her as she battles an identity crisis that should be torturous. This is definitely one anime where side characters have more depth than the protagonist.My biggest complaint about production is probably the music! Or rather, lack thereof! There is ONE song. Seriously. They play this same snippet of an awful piano piece over and over and the ambiance it brings to mind is ""elevator"" or maybe ""hotel lobby"".The ending is probably the saving grace. They manage to pull it all together and in the last episode, they throw in a bit of reflection on human nature that may or may not make watching the whole series worthwhile. (Don\'t worry, that\'s not a spoiler or anything.)If you are running out of shows to watch or just want some action that isn\'t Monster of the Week formulated then this isn\'t a total waste of time - but on the whole, it\'s quite forgettable. in, the execution is lackluster and anticlimactic.

I was obviously very bored so I have survived episodes 1-11 and some very boring witch hunting. You might miss some of the early minor character intros but you'll catch on to what each person’s role is. Skipping takes this anime from a 3/10 to a 5/10 i.e. it's still a very mediocre anime. The pacing is horribly slow and the characters are as drab as the art/animation/color palate. The general concept is really interesting but the execution kills it (in a bad way). Episodes 1-11 are 97% useless....That 3% is some character development but it's so insignificant you could probably just skip to episode 12 where an interesting plotline starts to develop (save ~6hrs of your life). Most people just drop this series because of this enormous amount of filler at the start. It literally drains the life out of you and by the time you get to the okay/sort of interesting stuff, you're done. If you skip, don't get your hopes up too much since it's only a mediocre anime at best. Stay for the unique storyline though; this was the predominant saving grace of this series. If you're tired of the redundant storylines circulating through anime, you'll be satisfied at the end of this series. Won't watch it again though.

After I finished watching it, I can say that it was a very good anime! It was something more unique, and since it was an older anime, it was a refreshing perspective of anime that is not seen in today's anime market. It was definitely dark, and had moments that were really suspenseful, and the characters all had their respective roles that made this anime flow well. Robin, the main character of this anime, was definitely my favorite. She is a...strong character, and her growth and development throughout the anime was interesting to watch. All the other characters were fun to watch too, and their roles were great as well. In 2020, this anime was a good watch, and I hope anyone that is looking for something new to watch picks this up. It may be slow at times, but even with the ending that left me wanting more, I recommend this anime for viewing. strong character, and her growth and development throughout the anime was interesting to watch.

If it was widescreen and HD, it could pass for a current show, which is something you can't say for a lot of early digipaint anime. A large part of that is down to its strong aesthetic. Instead of following trends of the time, it has its own distinctive look, with every character, costume, location, and object meticulously designed. I can't think of another show where I spend so much time admiring the design of walls, doors, and phones. It's an eye for place and atmosphere that would crop up again in Shuko...Murase's later work, Ergo Proxy.Witch Hunter Robin is probably the closest we've ever been to getting an X-Files anime, though Robin, Amon and co. are so weapons-grade stylish that Mulder and Scully look like dorks by comparison.

In particular, one of the twists in the final episode is so heavily telegraphed that you'll probably figure it out in the first episode.  To be fair, English speakers have an unfair advantage here, since some of the giveaway clues are English words that the intended Japanese audience wouldn't necessarily catch.  It doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the series, since I just like watching these characters going about their work, and the story does change gears after the halfway point.  The emphasis is usually more on the chase, the action, and the emotional fallout of what happens, and in those areas it succeeds.

This is especially notable considering it was animated by Sunrise, a studio known for making all sorts of amazing anime such as ""Inuyasha"", ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Code Geass"" among others. And while this series may not even come close to measuring up to the immensely high quality of those shows, it\'s still a very good series in its own right that doesn\'t deserve to be overlooked the way it has been, especially if you\'re a fan of noir-style or supernatural anime.Story (7/10):Set in a mostly mundane...world populated by mysterious people known only as ""Witches"", ""Witch Hunter Robin"" centres around the members of the STN-J (Solomon Executive Organization), an organization dedicated to combatting the harmful threat of Witches by hunting down and capturing any that they find (it\'s stated in the first episode that they have a strict rule against killing them, since they see capturing them as ""more humane""). The story follows the titular Robin Sena, a young girl who is brought to Japan to become the STN-J\'s latest member. After a brief misunderstanding, Robin is introduced to the other members of the team, including the team\'s leader, Amon, who is assigned by the organization\'s administrator, Takuma Zaizen, to be Robin\'s handler and partner. See, Robin is a ""Craft User"", a type of human considered to be like Witches but not quite, having the ability to generate fire at will. As such, Robin is trained by the others to control her ability, both so she isn\'t deemed as a threat like Witches and so she can help the organization in capturing Witches. Overtime, however, it becomes apparent that there is far more to this seemingly simple conflict than meets the eye.The series is notable for having a unique format; the first half of the series consists of single-episode, self-contained stories where the team track down and defeat a Witch that\'s causing some kind of problem, while the second half evolves the series into a single, sequential narrative where long-buried secrets start to be revealed and we learn some shocking secrets about Robin\'s past, Witches and the truth behind the purpose of the STN-J. Personally, I would say this has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, the first half does do a decent job at setting up the world and themes of the series, giving us insight into the work of the team as well as Witches, namely by showing us that they\'re not always the monsters the STN-J treat them as. While some of them are certainly terrible people, there are some who are very tragic figures or well-intentioned people who wish to use their powers for a good cause, even if their methods are far from ethical.On the other hand, the episodic format means that, for the first half of the series, story progression is put on the back-burner. As a result, many of the early episodes feel like filler, to the point that you could skip them completely and lose nothing of significance. This probably wouldn\'t be such a problem if it weren\'t for the fact that there isn\'t much character development in the first half, either, with a few members of the team feeling like they\'re just there. Even Robin and Amon\'s relationship is given very little focus in the first half, with the two of them spending the bare minimum of time together despite the fact that they\'re supposed to be partners. Granted, things do pick up significantly in the second half, with a number of twists and turns and the characters being given a lot more depth and development, particularly the main six, but I still couldn\'t help but feel that they didn\'t have to drag out the original format as long as they did, especially considering I still had a number of questions left even towards the end, though the finale is decent overall.Art & Animation (8/10):""Witch Hunter Robin"" is a fairly good-looking series. The character models and environments are very well-drawn and detailed and the special effects of the various Crafts and witch powers are great. The series\' art has a very dark palette, but given that it\'s a noir-style anime, that was almost certainly intentional. However, while the character designs aren\'t bad, some of them are very strange, particularly Robin\'s- while her hairstyle is actually quite plausible, the fact that she dresses like a woman from Victorian England isn\'t, especially since she came from Italy to Japan. It\'s not a bad outfit per se, but it definitely feels out of place considering everyone else dresses in modern clothing. Overall, though, the series has aged quite well in comparison to some other anime of its time, if not so well when compared to some other Sunrise anime.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):""Witch Hunter Robin""\'s sound design is bar none the best thing about it. The soundtrack is fantastic, being an early great from Taku Iwasaki, the same man behind great music for other anime like ""Gurren Lagann"" and ""The Irregular at Magic High School"". The music tends to be very moody and really empathises the tense atmosphere of the show. My favourite tracks would have to be the opening ""Shell"" and the ending theme ""half pain"", which were good enough that I listened to them every time I started and finished an episode. The voice acting is great as well- Kari Wahlgren does a respectable job as the shy, reserved Robin and Crispin Freeman has the perfect voice for the brooding, serious Amon. Besides these two, the series features a number of big names like Johnny Yong Bosch, Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, Dave Wittenberg and Jamieson Price, though since this was at a very early part in their careers, some of the performances might not be as good as you would expect from them.Characters (7.5/10):In the beginning, despite Robin having been aware of her power for quite some time, she starts off with pretty much no control over it- she can summon fire, but she has no control over what she burns or how much fire she produces. Naturally, this makes her something of a liability in the beginning, and so she is trained to control her power in the early episodes, particularly her accuracy with it. Soon enough, she is able to control it very well, and becomes much more formidable as a result. Personality-wise, she isn’t at all like how you would expect someone with fire powers to act, being very shy and reserved and not at all hot-blooded or energetic. While I did find her to be a great protagonist, particularly in the second half which delves into her origins and past, I also found her to be pretty annoying at times, mostly in early episodes where she has a tendency to ask very basic questions that should be pretty self-explanatory to the average viewer. She’s also shown on a couple of occasions to kill people with little-to-no emotion or remorse, which feels weirdly out of place in a team that otherwise has a strict “no killing” rule. There’s also Amon, the deuteragonist and leader of the team who, as I mentioned above, is assigned as Robin’s partner when she joins. However, to be perfectly frank, Amon is not a nice person, treating Robin very coldly for most of the first half, though this stems partially from his hatred of Witches due to his past, and he can’t see much difference between Robin and a Witch. As the series goes on, Amon frequently goes from protecting Robin to trying to kill her, but eventually he proves that he is well and truly on her side, even risking his own well-bring on several occasions to ensure hers.If I were to pick a favourite character, it would have to be Miho Karasuma, the second-in-command of the team and a “Craft User” like Robin (specifically, she has the ability to feel strong emotions via touch), who acts like a mentor to her in early episodes. Not only is she a highly competent agent, which she especially shows in the second half, but she also acts as a mother figure to the team, and consistently shows herself to be a far kinder and more amicable person than you could ever expect Amon to be. In fact, as far as the main characters go, she’s the nicest one of them, being the only one to treat Robin with respect from the beginning as opposed to warming up to her overtime. Next is Michael Lee, the brains of the team and an anti-social young man who spends most of his time on his computer, rarely interacting with the others unless he has to. Fortunately, this attitude is given an explanation early on, with him being the only one whose backstory is revealed in the first half. Without giving too much away, he never asked to be part of the team, but was confined to the STN-J building for the all-too-common crime of “knowing too much”. Making him more likable is that he does grow to care for the others as time passes, culminating in him doing everything he can to help them when things go south.Another member of the team is Haruto Sakaki, a young man who serves as a typical comic relief character- he’s hot-headed and frequently jumps into situations without thinking, serving as the butt of many unfortunate situations in the process. Even so, he proves himself to be a supportive and loyal member of the team, even if it takes a while for him to accept Robin, and he provides much-needed levity in a series that’s pretty dark and grim, even when you’re hoping that something good will happen to him for once. Finally, there’s Yurika Dojima, a lazy woman who will take shopping over work any day, and tends to do as little as possible on the rare occasion she comes to the office. She’s also one of the most antagonistic towards Robin at first, outright stating she doesn’t like her and calling her the demeaning nickname “Little Robin”. However, this becomes affectionate as Yurika warms up to Robin, and she proves herself to actually be quite competent when she puts her mind to it. That said, while I did grow to like her overtime, I still found her to be the weakest link as far as the main cast goes.Even discounting the main cast, the series has a fairly large number of characters, both recurring and one-shot. There’s not much I can say without giving away some spoilers, but a lot of them at least manage to contribute something to the story or have some moments to shine, though there are some who are given no real focus at all. The most glaring example of this is Touko Masaki, a woman who serves as Robin’s roommate at the beginning of the series and is established to have relationships with a number of characters over her screentime, yet the series ultimately doesn’t go anywhere with any of them. Really, she’s just unceremoniously written out of the series at a certain point and is never seen again, almost as though Sunrise realised that they just didn’t know what to do with her character.Enjoyment (7.5/10):""Witch Hunter Robin"" is certainly an enjoyable and exciting series, with every episode guaranteed to have at least some action. Even so, not only is it dark from the get-go but it can also be quite grim, even considering the team have a rule against killing and contain Witches in the humane way. Things get especially bad in the second half, with all kinds of shocking revelations about the STN-J among other things, and while things end on a high note, exactly how happy the ending is depends a lot on interpretation and personal taste.Overall:It’s pretty rare that an anime by Sunrise ends up being almost completely forgotten, but that’s exactly what happened with “Witch Hunter Robin”, which is pretty disappointing. Sure, the story’s not the best, especially the pacing, but it’s still worth watching for fans of noir or supernatural, with good visuals (strange character designs notwithstanding), likable, well-developed characters, fantastic music and exciting action scenes.Score:7+8+9+7.5+7.5=39/50=7.8/10 world populated by mysterious people known only as ""Witches"", ""Witch Hunter Robin"" centres around the members of the STN-J (Solomon Executive Organization), an organization dedicated to combatting the harmful threat of Witches by hunting down and capturing any that they find (it\'s stated in the first episode that they have a strict rule against killing them, since they see capturing them as ""more humane""). The story follows the titular Robin Sena, a young girl who is brought to Japan to become the STN-J\'s latest member. After a brief misunderstanding, Robin is introduced to the other members of the team, including the team\'s leader, Amon, who is assigned by the organization\'s administrator, Takuma Zaizen, to be Robin\'s handler and partner. See, Robin is a ""Craft User"", a type of human considered to be like Witches but not quite, having the ability to generate fire at will. As such, Robin is trained by the others to control her ability, both so she isn\'t deemed as a threat like Witches and so she can help the organization in capturing Witches. Overtime, however, it becomes apparent that there is far more to this seemingly simple conflict than meets the eye.The series is notable for having a unique format; the first half of the series consists of single-episode, self-contained stories where the team track down and defeat a Witch that\'s causing some kind of problem, while the second half evolves the series into a single, sequential narrative where long-buried secrets start to be revealed and we learn some shocking secrets about Robin\'s past, Witches and the truth behind the purpose of the STN-J. Personally, I would say this has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, the first half does do a decent job at setting up the world and themes of the series, giving us insight into the work of the team as well as Witches, namely by showing us that they\'re not always the monsters the STN-J treat them as. While some of them are certainly terrible people, there are some who are very tragic figures or well-intentioned people who wish to use their powers for a good cause, even if their methods are far from ethical.On the other hand, the episodic format means that, for the first half of the series, story progression is put on the back-burner. As a result, many of the early episodes feel like filler, to the point that you could skip them completely and lose nothing of significance. This probably wouldn\'t be such a problem if it weren\'t for the fact that there isn\'t much character development in the first half, either, with a few members of the team feeling like they\'re just there. Even Robin and Amon\'s relationship is given very little focus in the first half, with the two of them spending the bare minimum of time together despite the fact that they\'re supposed to be partners. Granted, things do pick up significantly in the second half, with a number of twists and turns and the characters being given a lot more depth and development, particularly the main six, but I still couldn\'t help but feel that they didn\'t have to drag out the original format as long as they did, especially considering I still had a number of questions left even towards the end, though the finale is decent overall.Art & Animation (8/10):""Witch Hunter Robin"" is a fairly good-looking series. The character models and environments are very well-drawn and detailed and the special effects of the various Crafts and witch powers are great. The series\' art has a very dark palette, but given that it\'s a noir-style anime, that was almost certainly intentional. However, while the character designs aren\'t bad, some of them are very strange, particularly Robin\'s- while her hairstyle is actually quite plausible, the fact that she dresses like a woman from Victorian England isn\'t, especially since she came from Italy to Japan. It\'s not a bad outfit per se, but it definitely feels out of place considering everyone else dresses in modern clothing. Overall, though, the series has aged quite well in comparison to some other anime of its time, if not so well when compared to some other Sunrise anime.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):""Witch Hunter Robin""\'s sound design is bar none the best thing about it. The soundtrack is fantastic, being an early great from Taku Iwasaki, the same man behind great music for other anime like ""Gurren Lagann"" and ""The Irregular at Magic High School"". The music tends to be very moody and really empathises the tense atmosphere of the show. My favourite tracks would have to be the opening ""Shell"" and the ending theme ""half pain"", which were good enough that I listened to them every time I started and finished an episode. The voice acting is great as well- Kari Wahlgren does a respectable job as the shy, reserved Robin and Crispin Freeman has the perfect voice for the brooding, serious Amon. Besides these two, the series features a number of big names like Johnny Yong Bosch, Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, Dave Wittenberg and Jamieson Price, though since this was at a very early part in their careers, some of the performances might not be as good as you would expect from them.Characters (7.5/10):In the beginning, despite Robin having been aware of her power for quite some time, she starts off with pretty much no control over it- she can summon fire, but she has no control over what she burns or how much fire she produces. Naturally, this makes her something of a liability in the beginning, and so she is trained to control her power in the early episodes, particularly her accuracy with it. Soon enough, she is able to control it very well, and becomes much more formidable as a result. Personality-wise, she isn’t at all like how you would expect someone with fire powers to act, being very shy and reserved and not at all hot-blooded or energetic. While I did find her to be a great protagonist, particularly in the second half which delves into her origins and past, I also found her to be pretty annoying at times, mostly in early episodes where she has a tendency to ask very basic questions that should be pretty self-explanatory to the average viewer. She’s also shown on a couple of occasions to kill people with little-to-no emotion or remorse, which feels weirdly out of place in a team that otherwise has a strict “no killing” rule. There’s also Amon, the deuteragonist and leader of the team who, as I mentioned above, is assigned as Robin’s partner when she joins. However, to be perfectly frank, Amon is not a nice person, treating Robin very coldly for most of the first half, though this stems partially from his hatred of Witches due to his past, and he can’t see much difference between Robin and a Witch. As the series goes on, Amon frequently goes from protecting Robin to trying to kill her, but eventually he proves that he is well and truly on her side, even risking his own well-bring on several occasions to ensure hers.If I were to pick a favourite character, it would have to be Miho Karasuma, the second-in-command of the team and a “Craft User” like Robin (specifically, she has the ability to feel strong emotions via touch), who acts like a mentor to her in early episodes. Not only is she a highly competent agent, which she especially shows in the second half, but she also acts as a mother figure to the team, and consistently shows herself to be a far kinder and more amicable person than you could ever expect Amon to be. In fact, as far as the main characters go, she’s the nicest one of them, being the only one to treat Robin with respect from the beginning as opposed to warming up to her overtime. Next is Michael Lee, the brains of the team and an anti-social young man who spends most of his time on his computer, rarely interacting with the others unless he has to. Fortunately, this attitude is given an explanation early on, with him being the only one whose backstory is revealed in the first half. Without giving too much away, he never asked to be part of the team, but was confined to the STN-J building for the all-too-common crime of “knowing too much”. Making him more likable is that he does grow to care for the others as time passes, culminating in him doing everything he can to help them when things go south.Another member of the team is Haruto Sakaki, a young man who serves as a typical comic relief character- he’s hot-headed and frequently jumps into situations without thinking, serving as the butt of many unfortunate situations in the process. Even so, he proves himself to be a supportive and loyal member of the team, even if it takes a while for him to accept Robin, and he provides much-needed levity in a series that’s pretty dark and grim, even when you’re hoping that something good will happen to him for once. Finally, there’s Yurika Dojima, a lazy woman who will take shopping over work any day, and tends to do as little as possible on the rare occasion she comes to the office. She’s also one of the most antagonistic towards Robin at first, outright stating she doesn’t like her and calling her the demeaning nickname “Little Robin”. However, this becomes affectionate as Yurika warms up to Robin, and she proves herself to actually be quite competent when she puts her mind to it. That said, while I did grow to like her overtime, I still found her to be the weakest link as far as the main cast goes.Even discounting the main cast, the series has a fairly large number of characters, both recurring and one-shot. There’s not much I can say without giving away some spoilers, but a lot of them at least manage to contribute something to the story or have some moments to shine, though there are some who are given no real focus at all. The most glaring example of this is Touko Masaki, a woman who serves as Robin’s roommate at the beginning of the series and is established to have relationships with a number of characters over her screentime, yet the series ultimately doesn’t go anywhere with any of them. Really, she’s just unceremoniously written out of the series at a certain point and is never seen again, almost as though Sunrise realised that they just didn’t know what to do with her character.Enjoyment (7.5/10):""Witch Hunter Robin"" is certainly an enjoyable and exciting series, with every episode guaranteed to have at least some action. Even so, not only is it dark from the get-go but it can also be quite grim, even considering the team have a rule against killing and contain Witches in the humane way. Things get especially bad in the second half, with all kinds of shocking revelations about the STN-J among other things, and while things end on a high note, exactly how happy the ending is depends a lot on interpretation and personal taste.Overall:It’s pretty rare that an anime by Sunrise ends up being almost completely forgotten, but that’s exactly what happened with “Witch Hunter Robin”, which is pretty disappointing.

I wondered why such a series with a striking female lead and catchy summary had so little popularity and decided to watch and see.Beautiful music and animation, classy and intriguing character design. It has been a serious while since I have come across an anime where every person has their own look, style, attitude, and even facial features. Lately, I have been doing an experiment by imagining each character without their hair.

Well, in Witch Hunter Robin, this is not the case – appears actual care was taken when each character was created and animated.The series’ Goth-steampunk-y reality gets an additional boost by its great soundtrack. The opening and closing songs are amazing and so is the music used all around the scenes. It is strong and beautiful and, at the same time, melancholic, alluring and mysterious – just like the lead character should be.Unfortunately, somehow this is all wasted. The anime fails to provide any background and any chain of events, but rather stays in the dubious genre of an action slice of life and this is a paradox on its own. The development is so slow that I had to watch on double speed. Even then, I would still get bored while waiting for people to turn their heads while speaking.

In my opinion I feel like this movie was just a side project for the animators to flex their skills and they just decided to tack on a story afterwards as a passing thought.The Bad:I think I got an aneurysm trying to understand the plot, this was more confusing then the last season of Attack on titan. The movie just tries to introduce way too many plot points, and there are also gaping...plot holes i.e where the town is getting food and gasoline when they are in an isolated bubble which was never explained in the movie mind you. All the relationships feel so forced and go through more fluctuation in the period of 2 hours then the amount of times I said ""what the fuck is happening?"" while watching this movie (I said it a lot). The characters are so bland and the father of the MC and his brother are basically indistinguishable as characters as well as most of the posse around the MC with the generic comedic relief and the serious guy as well as the annoying girls who hate being with ""the boys"" but still stick around them?The Ugly:Overall the plot is just so convoluted in a way that it just feels tacked together. The pacing is way off too, it is way too fast in the beginning and doesn\'t take time to explain anything and the ending feels slow. They try to pass on some generic ""life is beautiful because you get hurt"" and ""our good and bad emotions should be embraced and accepted thing"" but the only execution is just so horrible and again feels very forced. I was actually hyped for this when I saw the trailer and the amazing art but boy was this a let down, they managed to fumble such an amazing premise and world building and do absolutely fuck all with it.To preface I love shows where they don\'t tell you everything and are a little confusing such as Evangelion and Sonny Boy but this show was just on another level of stupidity.  Complete waste of 2 hours I\'m never getting back do not watch if you value your time! plot holes i.e where the town is getting food and gasoline when they are in an isolated bubble which was never explained in the movie mind you.

Complete waste of 2 hours I\'m never getting back do not watch if you value your time!', ""Oh, Mari Okada, I wish I knew how I felt about you as a creator. After her theatrical debut with Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms, she's back in the director's seat with a brand new movie, Maboroshi, or if you wanna use its Japanese title, Alice and Therese's Illusion Factory. No, I don't know why the Japanese title is so strange. I read something about how the names Alice and Therese, when said in Japanese together, also pronounce the name Aristotle in their language, which makes you wonder why they didn't just call it Aristotle's Illusion Factory, especially since there are no characters named...Alice and Therese in the film, but I digress. Anyway, Mari Okada is pretty prominent in the anime circle, and people tend to be divided on what she works on or creates. Some like her stuff, others hate it, and some are mixed. There are anime she's worked on that I really love, such as AnoHana, Maquia, and Anthem of the Heart, but also titles that I'm really not a fan of, such as A Whisker Away, A Lull In The Sea, and Hanasaku Iroha. If you get the chance, I highly recommend you read her autobiography, as it's really enlightening and fascinating. Now that Maboroshi is out (I'm going to refer to it by the official English title that Netflix gave it for the sake of brevity)...unfortunately, I don't feel this movie is as good as Maquia. Someone on a blog I follow described it best, that Maboroshi is the most Mari Okada movie ever made, with all of her indulgences and writing tropes concentrated into one movie. Not gonna lie, they're absolutely right, and unfortunately, this isn't one of her better movies, which is a shame because there is a lot to like about it!14-year-old Masamune Kikuiri is your average middle school kid who likes hanging with his friends and practicing drawing in his rural Japanese town. One day, an explosion at the local steelworks factory literally shatters the sky as if by magic, cutting the town off from the rest of Japan. Time is literally frozen. Nobody ages or grows old, the seasons never change, there's no new forms of entertainment, the world has truly become static. Everyone trudges on, hoping the world will right itself, but nothing changes. One day, Masamune has an unpleasant encounter with his mysterious classmate Mutsumi Sagami, who sneaks him into the abandoned factory to show him something...or rather, someone: A feral girl she's been taking care of in secret, whom Masamune names Itsumi. Upon getting to know her and the circumstances surrounding her imprisonment, Masamune discovers that Itsumi's existence might just be the key to figuring out why the town is in the state that its in. But some people fear what could happen if things change, doing all they can to keep the kids from helping Itsumi.Gentle reader, I ask you, did you ever read that Ursula K. Le Guin book The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas and wonder why nobody in the book bothers to just rescue the abused child from their imprisonment? Mari Okada decided to actually do just that, taking that one question and building the whole house around it, which forms the backbone of Maboroshi. The story is actually the most interesting part about this movie, really going deep into examining just what being stuck in a truly static world and never physically changing does to a person and a whole community. Imagine being an elderly person who struggles with daily tasks who can't even die, or a pregnant woman whose child will never be born. It also explores what happens when people look to those who seem like they have the answers, even if the person in question is a crazy old coot whose explanations have no real basis in logic. Gee, that totally doesn't remind me of a cult leader or anything. The implications behind the world these people live in are really terrifying and depressing if you think about them, which is obviously intentional on the movie's part. Using all this to craft a story about the fear of change and the difference between making the best out of a bad situation and simply resigning yourself to it is done really well here.The stellar animation and deliberately 90s music also really helps bring this dilapidated, static town to life, making it into a character of its own. Yes, Maboroshi is firmly set in the nineties on purpose, and kudos to the movie for really putting a lot of care into recreating that time period down to the last detail. Oh, and I bet you're wondering why the singer they brought on to sing the ending song has such an...interesting voice. Remember how in Maquia, Mari Okada really wanted to have Bravely Default veteran Akihiko Yoshida to do the character designs for the movie because she really liked his work? For Maboroshi, according an article on ANN, Okada personally asked popular singer Miyuki Nakajima to create an original song just for the movie because she really loved her songs, and the reason her voice sounds so distinct and unlike most of what you hear in anime movies is because Nakajima is 71 years old. I admit I'm not familiar with Nakajima's work besides Shin-On, but the fact that she's still singing well into her seventies is pretty amazing.God, you have no idea how much I wish I could have liked this movie more than I do. The basic set-up is interesting, and I actually cared about Itsumi's plight. Unfortunately, the characters and how Okada uses them are the movie's biggest weakness. I thought the male lead, Masamune, was fine as a character. Not the most three-dimensional, sure, but he has his reasons for doing what he does and his insecurities and frustrations are relatable. However, other than him and Itsumi, none of the other characters are in any way interesting or compelling whatsoever, and there are several that feel really out of place in this movie. I really could have done without that pervy fat kid and his antics. This also leads into one of Okada's biggest weaknesses as a writer: For some reason she has this bad tendency to shove pointless love triangles/polygons in the stuff she works on, even when having them would feel really out of place and on characters that she really doesn't bother to develop or flesh out. There's a girl in the movie whose only reason for existing is to tell Masamune she has a crush on him, and for a really dumb reason at that, and to be fridged just to get the main conflict going, and I really couldn't give a shit about her because the movie never bothered to flesh her out beyond the fact that she has a crush on Masamune. Plus, I really didn't like Mutsumi as a character, and the fact that the movie introduces her by having her show her panties to Masamune just to give them a reason to interact is just...gross. You literally could have done anything else just to get them to talk to one another. Hell, Mutsumi spends a lot of her time being mean to Masamune and dragging him into her problems, with Masamune rightfully calling her out on her behavior a lot of the time...and then later in the movie they're suddenly in love and falling all over themselves for each other. And I'm sorry, but I could not buy their romance at all. Not only did they hardly ever spend time with one another for there to be any romantic or even friendly chemistry between them whatsoever, Mutsumi spends so much of the movie being a bitch that I really couldn't see why Masamune would even fall in love with her in the first place. Every attempt at romance in this movie seems thrown in there just for the sake of shoving in some contrived drama when they could easily be cut out to make for time to actually develop the characters. You could literally cut most of the side characters out of the movie and it'd probably be better off.And for as much as I like the overall story for this movie, a lot of the conflict stems from people acting like arrogant pricks who can't use their heads for one second or even refusing to do really basic things that could have been resolved things right then and there. There's so many plot threads left hanging and basic questions the movie just flat-out doesn't answer because it's more concerned about having every character fall in love than actually doing something. Man, it sucks that I couldn't enjoy this movie more, because it does have some genuinely great stuff in it, and I think its great that Mari Okada is being allowed to do more of what she wants as a creator. I certainly hope she gets to do more things after this. But I and other people find that her works tend to be better when she has someone to reign her in sometimes or if she just cuts the needless romantic drama bullshit. So yeah, I prefer Maquia over Maboroshi, as the latter is a little too preoccupied with pointless drama to care much about character development or really making full use of its potential. But that's not to say Maboroshi doesn't have anything to offer, like I mentioned above. If you like the movie, more power to you. Maboroshi isn't the best or worst thing Okada made, and I hope the next movie she makes is successful. Oh, and I recommend you watch the English dub, both because it is genuinely very good, and because they cast an actual child actress to play Itsumi, which makes her sound far more authentic and bearable to listen to compared to putting up with the literal auditory nightmare that is Misaki Kuno's squeak toy voice.

Someone on a blog I follow described it best, that Maboroshi is the most Mari Okada movie ever made, with all of her indulgences and writing tropes concentrated into one movie. Not gonna lie, they're absolutely right, and unfortunately, this isn't one of her better movies, which is a shame because there is a lot to like about it!14-year-old Masamune Kikuiri is your average middle school kid who likes hanging with his friends and practicing drawing in his rural Japanese town. One day, an explosion at the local steelworks factory literally shatters the sky as if by magic, cutting the town off from the rest of Japan. Time is literally frozen. Nobody ages or grows old, the seasons never change, there's no new forms of entertainment, the world has truly become static. Everyone trudges on, hoping the world will right itself, but nothing changes. One day, Masamune has an unpleasant encounter with his mysterious classmate Mutsumi Sagami, who sneaks him into the abandoned factory to show him something...or rather, someone: A feral girl she's been taking care of in secret, whom Masamune names Itsumi. Upon getting to know her and the circumstances surrounding her imprisonment, Masamune discovers that Itsumi's existence might just be the key to figuring out why the town is in the state that its in. But some people fear what could happen if things change, doing all they can to keep the kids from helping Itsumi.Gentle reader, I ask you, did you ever read that Ursula K. Le Guin book The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas and wonder why nobody in the book bothers to just rescue the abused child from their imprisonment? Mari Okada decided to actually do just that, taking that one question and building the whole house around it, which forms the backbone of Maboroshi. The story is actually the most interesting part about this movie, really going deep into examining just what being stuck in a truly static world and never physically changing does to a person and a whole community. Imagine being an elderly person who struggles with daily tasks who can't even die, or a pregnant woman whose child will never be born. It also explores what happens when people look to those who seem like they have the answers, even if the person in question is a crazy old coot whose explanations have no real basis in logic. Gee, that totally doesn't remind me of a cult leader or anything. The implications behind the world these people live in are really terrifying and depressing if you think about them, which is obviously intentional on the movie's part. Using all this to craft a story about the fear of change and the difference between making the best out of a bad situation and simply resigning yourself to it is done really well here.The stellar animation and deliberately 90s music also really helps bring this dilapidated, static town to life, making it into a character of its own. Yes, Maboroshi is firmly set in the nineties on purpose, and kudos to the movie for really putting a lot of care into recreating that time period down to the last detail. Oh, and I bet you're wondering why the singer they brought on to sing the ending song has such an...interesting voice. Remember how in Maquia, Mari Okada really wanted to have Bravely Default veteran Akihiko Yoshida to do the character designs for the movie because she really liked his work? For Maboroshi, according an article on ANN, Okada personally asked popular singer Miyuki Nakajima to create an original song just for the movie because she really loved her songs, and the reason her voice sounds so distinct and unlike most of what you hear in anime movies is because Nakajima is 71 years old. I admit I'm not familiar with Nakajima's work besides Shin-On, but the fact that she's still singing well into her seventies is pretty amazing.God, you have no idea how much I wish I could have liked this movie more than I do. The basic set-up is interesting, and I actually cared about Itsumi's plight. Unfortunately, the characters and how Okada uses them are the movie's biggest weakness. I thought the male lead, Masamune, was fine as a character. Not the most three-dimensional, sure, but he has his reasons for doing what he does and his insecurities and frustrations are relatable. However, other than him and Itsumi, none of the other characters are in any way interesting or compelling whatsoever, and there are several that feel really out of place in this movie. I really could have done without that pervy fat kid and his antics. This also leads into one of Okada's biggest weaknesses as a writer: For some reason she has this bad tendency to shove pointless love triangles/polygons in the stuff she works on, even when having them would feel really out of place and on characters that she really doesn't bother to develop or flesh out. There's a girl in the movie whose only reason for existing is to tell Masamune she has a crush on him, and for a really dumb reason at that, and to be fridged just to get the main conflict going, and I really couldn't give a shit about her because the movie never bothered to flesh her out beyond the fact that she has a crush on Masamune. Plus, I really didn't like Mutsumi as a character, and the fact that the movie introduces her by having her show her panties to Masamune just to give them a reason to interact is just...gross. You literally could have done anything else just to get them to talk to one another. Hell, Mutsumi spends a lot of her time being mean to Masamune and dragging him into her problems, with Masamune rightfully calling her out on her behavior a lot of the time...and then later in the movie they're suddenly in love and falling all over themselves for each other. And I'm sorry, but I could not buy their romance at all. Not only did they hardly ever spend time with one another for there to be any romantic or even friendly chemistry between them whatsoever, Mutsumi spends so much of the movie being a bitch that I really couldn't see why Masamune would even fall in love with her in the first place. Every attempt at romance in this movie seems thrown in there just for the sake of shoving in some contrived drama when they could easily be cut out to make for time to actually develop the characters. You could literally cut most of the side characters out of the movie and it'd probably be better off.And for as much as I like the overall story for this movie, a lot of the conflict stems from people acting like arrogant pricks who can't use their heads for one second or even refusing to do really basic things that could have been resolved things right then and there. There's so many plot threads left hanging and basic questions the movie just flat-out doesn't answer because it's more concerned about having every character fall in love than actually doing something. Man, it sucks that I couldn't enjoy this movie more, because it does have some genuinely great stuff in it, and I think its great that Mari Okada is being allowed to do more of what she wants as a creator. I certainly hope she gets to do more things after this. But I and other people find that her works tend to be better when she has someone to reign her in sometimes or if she just cuts the needless romantic drama bullshit. So yeah, I prefer Maquia over Maboroshi, as the latter is a little too preoccupied with pointless drama to care much about character development or really making full use of its potential. But that's not to say Maboroshi doesn't have anything to offer, like I mentioned above. If you like the movie, more power to you. Maboroshi isn't the best or worst thing Okada made, and I hope the next movie she makes is successful. Oh, and I recommend you watch the English dub, both because it is genuinely very good, and because they cast an actual child actress to play Itsumi, which makes her sound far more authentic and bearable to listen to compared to putting up with the literal auditory nightmare that is Misaki Kuno's squeak toy voice."", ""This opinion will have spoilers and I am going to divide it into 3 points, the animation, the plot and the message.First speaking of the audiovisual, it is crazy, all the details are very careful, it has incredible fluidity, backgrounds to match and what would stand out the most is the color palette and the good use they gave it to emphasize and elevate many moments , they knew how to convey the despair of the world very well and they also knew how to highlight the small happy moments that the characters can have. As for the music, it is well implemented and thanks...to it it accompanies different emotional moments very well.Regarding the plot, it could be said that it is similar in several ways to Alice in Wonderland, but this time the point of view we have is that of someone inside the place and not that of the person who is lost. The narrative of the film seemed abstract to me, they leave us some clues in a tenuous way and this may mean that not many people understand everything 100% when watching it for the first time, but I do think that the message is clear.I personally liked the message, it is an optimistic message since what the author wants to tell us is that although we do not have a future, objective or a clear goal, we should try to continue improving, getting excited, having fun in the same way, the example is like Masamune He considers this and decides to look for variants within the static life he was leading, an example could be the relationship he establishes with Mutsumi, improving as an illustrator even though he did not have a clear goal or having fun with his friends despite everything, we can also see How there are people who take advantage of circumstances like this to gain status despite everything. Another thing that I liked is the temporal reference to what is called in Japan as “The Lost Decade” since the film is initially set in 1991 and there is a very interesting dialogue from Masamune's grandfather in which he emphasizes that what This reality is not a punishment, but rather the gods encapsulated the happiest moment of the town before it ends.It is an optimistic message about the search for identity, the growth and expansion that we can have as people and never losing the feeling of being alive.A contrast that I liked was how those who were trapped wanted to escape from the reality they were living in order to find their reason for loving life and how the visitor found what he loved within this place and wanted to stay. to it it accompanies different emotional moments very well.Regarding the plot, it could be said that it is similar in several ways to Alice in Wonderland, but this time the point of view we have is that of someone inside the place and not that of the person who is lost.

Moody and high concept, with beautifully rendered backgrounds, smooth animation, and a killer soundtrack. It had the makings of a masterpiece, and a great studio to back it up.When it quietly released on Netflix this January, I was excited to watch, though its score caused some trepidation. Indeed, all those elements the trailer promised are here in some form. If this film succeeds in any regard, it is aesthetically.Okada’s direction is sharp as ever here, as is every other aspect of the production. Its soundtrack is consistently strong, though misapplied occasionally. The voice...actors all give good performances, and the sound editing is as good as any other theatrical release. While it doesn’t quite measure up to Ghibli and CoMix Waves’ latest offerings, it's an impressive achievement for a back boiler MAPPA project.Where the film falters is its script. Okada is a fairly consistent scriptwriter, and she’s shown both inventiveness (Maquia) and ability to execute on convention (A Whisker Away). This script is no doubt her most ambitious, and it falls short in a few key ways.The characters aren’t great, particularly the side characters. I couldn’t tell you their names. I’m an advocate for the fat comic relief side character, but this film’s is more annoying than funny. He cracks maybe one funny joke across the whole runtime. One side romance is bizarre and left completely unresolved. The villain is never a legitimate threat, he almost gets beat up by children more times than he thwarts the protagonists. Among our three leads, there’s one uncomfortable spoilery relationship I can’t get into. The female MC’s main character traits are lying all the time and refusing to disclose key information. She's frustrating to watch, though her arc eventually leaves her in a better place. To give credit where it’s due, the character designs are all great. I may not remember their names, but their faces will stick with me.The plot is extremely confusing. As far as I can tell, a town is trapped in a purgatory-like state of stagnation following a disaster at the town’s steel mill. None of the residents age, and time does not pass. That much isn’t hard to understand, but the film insists on burying this information forty minutes into the runtime, well past the time we should be invested in the story.I’m accustomed to strange plot structures, but this one creates a big problem. Rather than building emotional investment in the characters in the first hour, the audience is left grasping at straws trying to piece together what the hell is going on. Once we’re told directly, things only get more confusing. The climax is borderline incoherent, though speaking any further would get into spoiler territory.All of this confusion may work in a more abstract setting, but this film’s otherwise straightforward plot demands the audience understands the specifics. This confusion eventually reaches a breaking point. The audience realizes they’re not going to figure it out, and all emotional investment goes out the window.A particular recurring element unintentionally mirrored my experience. At the very beginning, we hear a radio DJ replying to viewer messages. The characters ignore the broadcast. This plays again at the very end, and the main character yells at the questioners about the joy of living. This was meant to hammer home the film’s themes, but instead served as a powerful moment of catharsis. I was yelling at my TV at this point, frustrated by the unanswered questions and strange writing decisions. Both I and the MC had arrived at the same point, yelling about the absurdity of the media we were consuming. At that point I just laughed.I wanted to like this, but the plot lost me. Even so, I can’t help but respect the attempt. Okada could have pulled back, written a conventional tearjerker script, and I’d have probably loved it.

Its theatrical release in Japan came and went without much fanfare, until Netflix eventually bought the rights to it and decided to all but shadow-drop it on their platform. No one I talked to even knew this movie was coming out, which makes its ""non-existence"" in the...public eye all the more confusing to me, especially considering how good it actually is.First up, let\'s touch on the story. The story is... good, but convoluted. If you\'ve read or seen a Mari Okada work before, you\'ll know more or less what you\'re in for: sharp dialogue, introspective characters, a mystery element that is somehow both well-defined and not explained much at the same time. The pacing is race-car fast - the movie expects you to pick up on certain concepts very quickly, and does not slow down to re-explain or hammer home things you may have missed. Multiple viewings may be necessary for certain people in order to fully understand what is going on at all times, but that shouldn\'t be much of a problem when the whole thing looks and sounds THIS GOOD.Because yes, of course the movie looks phenomenal. We\'re talking Makoto Shinkai ""Your Name"" levels of animation quality here, but you already knew that, because the movie is made by MAPPA, and if there is one thing MAPPA consistently gets right, it\'s the visuals. I shudder to think how hard the animators must have worked on some of the segments here, because they\'re truly spectacular - easily up there with some of the highest-quality and most striking movie animation ever produced in the medium.The music is good, if not a touch unmemorable. The main theme is recognizable but not catchy, and does its job well enough. It immerses you in the scene and elevates the action, which is the most important thing for a soundtrack to do. I\'m not likely to listen to it on my own time outside of the movie, but I liked it as a companion piece.I\'m hesitant to write much more here out of a fear of spoiling things for any potential viewers - because I genuinely do want you to watch this movie. It\'s a beautiful piece of artwork full of heart from a studio at the top of its game, likely produced at the cost of its creators\' own health (it\'s no secret that MAPPA treats its employees like shit.) And despite having a story that can, at times, be a little confusing and convoluted, it contains a very human tale of what it means to love something in the face of absolute despair, and the human spirit\'s ability to persevere against all odds.So do yourself a favor and don\'t sleep on this like everyone else is doing - I think you\'ll be pleasantly surprised. public eye all the more confusing to me, especially considering how good it actually is.First up, let\'s touch on the story.

It is hard to say if it\'s a good or bad title, I can see the idea where it was about to go, but it didn\'t. I would say it would be way better in a 24+ episodes TV series with expanded takes on few stuff with a higher focus on characters and on smaller plot events.If I would have to tell in nutshell what the story is about, it can be understood as philosophical approach, or at least I would search one plot message in this, as with the direct story...shown.I will begin with direct story which we follow through without overthinking, it is a story of living in a town Mifuse in which time has stopped, people still live there but they are isolated from everything else and it was supposed to keep like that. Our main character Masamune is a Middle Schooler experiencing life as a growing up kid while encountering few nuances related to the time stopping theme. While in reality the movie focuses mainly on a romantic story of him and one of the girls. The romance approach is kinda specific, I would even find here some themes related to a classic Romeo and Juliet, of love which isn\'t accepted, here by characters aswell as they still enforce it by just showing specific views of ""reality"", which you might say is the outside world in the parallel Mifuse which is the represantation of everything if the time hasn\'t stopped.The philosophical approach which I would like to search it here as it would make the movie better. It portrays a fear of future and the desire to keep everything the same as it is, alot of people experience such thoughts and little fear, especially in the time of growing up or just right before we encounter the known changes, such as changing school, moving to another city, beginning job career, you might call out many stuff. The movie focuses on Middle Schoolers with little help of the adults showing the fear of future and what it might bring to you. Those who has accepted the incoming changes of the future acquire the ""shattered/broken heart"" in that movie. Which would fit a little bit of showing how ""perfect"" the future could be in that ""reality"" which in reality would be a fake image, an ilusion, while thinking that the real Mifuse is an ilusion. The character by thinking like that they would not understand how to achieve the future shown as a ""real world"" and they be afraid of how to approach it, while later understanding that nothing is that perfect even the visionary future.Does it make sense to have such approach to a movie, I don\'t know, but I would like to take a different look at it, maybe that theme would be little different but I can\'t describe it or explain it in better words, for which I am sorry.The animation for the current year is I would say decent.Music is fineCharacters are the biggest flaw here, which is why I would make it longer. Outside Masamune, his fater, his uncle, Mutsumi and Itsumi there aren\'t any scenes to make any attachments to other characters: Senba, Hara, Nitta, Sonobe, Mamoru etc. While the show itself is trying to make it a little bit emotional or some scenes related to them, but there are no possible attachments so the  audience, including me, won\'t care what is happening to them, either for happy or sad scenes.Plot well as mentioned above.So I will leave here 2 ratings for Direct and Philosophical approach seperately, how you\'ll understand or try to view at this movie, I can\'t guide anyone which is better/proper way, so that is up to you.If it\'s a direct approach for a romance, than it is a 5/10, it is just average. The animation as for 2024 is fine, but it isn\'t anything above that considering that it is a movie in which we usually expect a higher quality, the plot might be confusing most likely to being too short, characters are bland, so if there isn\'t any deeper meaning in a movie, than 5 is the maximum I can give it.If it has a deeper philosophical meaning, which I might misunderstood at first view, maybe a rewatch would be more helpful, not sure if I actually want to rewatch it. Than here we can speak for at least a 6/10 as the story will give a little bit more values, but it will still lack due to being too short, if the story would be lengthen by at least one more hour and try to focus at some scenes, events and especially characters than it could be a way better movie than it is for now. shown.I will begin with direct story which we follow through without overthinking, it is a story of living in a town Mifuse in which time has stopped, people still live there but they are isolated from everything else and it was supposed to keep like that. Our main character Masamune is a Middle Schooler experiencing life as a growing up kid while encountering few nuances related to the time stopping theme. While in reality the movie focuses mainly on a romantic story of him and one of the girls. The romance approach is kinda specific, I would even find here some themes related to a classic Romeo and Juliet, of love which isn\'t accepted, here by characters aswell as they still enforce it by just showing specific views of ""reality"", which you might say is the outside world in the parallel Mifuse which is the represantation of everything if the time hasn\'t stopped.The philosophical approach which I would like to search it here as it would make the movie better. It portrays a fear of future and the desire to keep everything the same as it is, alot of people experience such thoughts and little fear, especially in the time of growing up or just right before we encounter the known changes, such as changing school, moving to another city, beginning job career, you might call out many stuff. The movie focuses on Middle Schoolers with little help of the adults showing the fear of future and what it might bring to you.

It’s a solid movie. Great art, great sound, feel good storyline and most importantly great characters. People are trying to find “logical” flaws everywhere but forget to realize this is a work of fiction and it should be enjoyed as such. Kick back, relax and enjoy :)The story was not predictable. Art style was beautiful, and loved the detail in minor things. Sound design was also awesome.I seriously think you all will enjoy it as long as watch it for what it is and not what it isn’t. If you want something scientifically accurate watch a documentary or National Geographic. ', 'Okada’s work is always so difficult to talk about. She blends surrealism with melodrama and conventional narrative tropes in a way that completely absorbs you in the beauty of her worlds, without sacrificing mainstream accessibility or emotional edge. Often it can come across as underdeveloped or lacking in cohesion (or even just generic), but generally I’ve always managed to find a personal connection somewhere within her stories, although I understand that they don’t work for everybody.Maboroshi, like the rest of her work, really struggles to hold itself together sometimes, but at its best moments it’s absolutely brimming with passion. Its contemplative reflection on the...human condition, on the nature of love and ultimately on motherhood is just so Okada. Her direction has gotten much stronger since Maquia, and my god the art style and world building are just stunning; like virtually all of my Okada experiences (excluding Toradora), it’s so hard not to love.On a side note, anime fans do this thing that I really hate where they attribute all of a film or series’s best features to the studio that produces it. Maboroshi is not great because it is MAPPA, nor does it look good because it is MAPPA. It’s great because Okada’s usual team poured their talent into it for 5 long years; I suppose film fans do this too with stuff like A24, but the point is that it’s a misleading form of praise that neglects the artists involved. human condition, on the nature of love and ultimately on motherhood is just so Okada.

So, there's nothing special there. Which leaves the story to carry the bulk of the film,...and boy, is it frustrating.The basic concept for the story is great; a mysterious explosion traps a small Japanese town in a timeless state, with a cracked sky annually repaired by a strange being of smoke emanating from the broken steelworks. There's a few ways the story could have played out: a Stand By Me style adventure story with a group of young boys trying to escape this dreadful purgatory straight out of Bruce Springsteen's nightmares while the conservative adults are willing to while away eternity doing nothing, or maybe a horror approach could work, with the towns strange denizens, like the bizarre and off-putting Sagami family that runs the local shrine, eventually turning the town into a Fatal Frame/SIREN-esque Shinto horror show.  Both ideas seemed to be toyed with by the film before being discarded, alongside countless other potential plot threads or characters. What is the film actually like?Well, for a start, it is abysmally paced, even for the very low standards of anime films. Usually, said films feel way too fast, cramming a series worth of information into feature length, which ends up leaving everything feeling underdeveloped and shallow. Maboroshi has the exact same problem due to the exact opposite approach-IT IS LONG. AND SLOW. At nearly two hours, the film drags, and drags, and drags and only picks up a modicum of steam at the halfway point, and by then the vague characterization and details light plot have likely worn away your patience. And its all in service to themes and characters that are, at best, yet another nostalgic, bittersweet reflection on youth and coming of age, which is essentially the description of every anime film made in the past 20 years or more and has long since outworn its welcome, while at worst, the film is a pretentious collection of melancholic scenes of longing and confusion and all that melodramatic crap barely connected by shallow, incoherent characters who act more in service to overwrought metaphors and imagery than anything approaching actual human motivations.Even if you think you'd manage to connect with the navel-gazing and underwritten plot, I feel the need to reiterate just how slow the film is. It is absolutely not worth your time. You can get the same kind of atmosphere, ephemeral feeling and existential themes from a 20 minute episode of Kino's Journey, and that also has guns and a talking motorcycle, so there is absolutely no reason to waste your precious time with a film that, fittingly, feels like it's frozen in time and never going anywhere. and boy, is it frustrating.The basic concept for the story is great; a mysterious explosion traps a small Japanese town in a timeless state, with a cracked sky annually repaired by a strange being of smoke emanating from the broken steelworks.

It did well to set this up and it makes sense with the setting being a town where you are literally not allowed to change, but instead the story decided to go down a path Sigmund Freud would love with an elektra complex focus for god knows what reason.To give the film some credit, it has an incredibly intriguing premise - I may have been confused at times but not once was I bored. I didn't...read a summary other than glancing at the sypnosis which mentioned how people weren't allowed to change - I think if I didn't see that I would've been a whole lot more confused because I didn't understand this had supernatural elements and people literally weren't changing until the third exposition by the main character. These initial expositions clueing the viewer into the situation of the town were done well, it didn't feel like I was being ham fisted the backstory - but again it took a while for it to click with me and I don't think somebody going in blind would get it either until atleast halfway through the film.The main character didn't really feel like a person to me, he felt very much like a vehicle for the audience to view the world. He has no distinguishable character traits other than...being good at drawing? That was quite literally the only trait he had, his personality was that of a discarded receipt that had fallen into a puddle on the sidewalk. Completely irrelevant and forgotten. This of course creates a problem when this anime is allegedly...a romance.The main female lead, at least I believe she's supposed to be, is - I can't really say this nicely but she's genuinely an insufferable bitch? Pretty much every scene she's in she's just...being a bitch. No spoilers so I can't back these up but she's just a horrible person to everyone?Now you can probably imagine why it's hard to believe a romance when the people who are meant to be at the centre of it are a wet wipe and an asshole. Maybe they are suited to each other...but no accidental puns aside the romance is horrifically forced and at no point did I feel like it made sense. I can think of one possible justification as to why they're meant to be the romance partners of this anime which is revealed about halfway through but if that is genuinely meant to be the reason they're in love then it simply creates more questions than answers and doesn't give across the right message in my opinion.Then there's the child. I can't say all too much because again, spoilers but just...why. They could have genuinely removed this character completely and the anime would have been better, which clearly shouldn't be the case considering she's a vital character towards the premise but it really is. She's meant to facilitate the two main characters arcs but they don't go through an arc so she is literally redundant. Her own...developments are just weird. So weird. It seems the only reason she's there is so they can add the theme of 'love between boys and girls' into the description but this theme just serves to the detriment of the anime.Spirit wolf, sacred wolf, whatever it is is incredibly confusing and convoluted, I didn't fully understand it either by the end - the film had a solid enough premise without it. Nothing would really have changed if they just did away with that layer of the not-changing world.Another over-the-top two dimensional so evil he's evil wow evil, villain. What's new, not surprised just disappointed that we continue to get these boring antagonists who are just plot points and serve as anticlimactic stake makers for the main characters.It's a shame this sucked so bad because I always look forward to watching these stories told by women as typically romances written by men fail to capture any nuance especially with the women characters - here the woman character does have nuance I'll give her that but the plot surrounding her just diminishes it all to nothing.

This is my first ever review I will keep it very short and sweet. First off, if you like me were worried the story would be confusing or not make sense all i can say is at least for me the entire story made perfect sense and never felt confusing. Every element is written to make sense and I was surprised at how coherent it all was because i had seen so many reviews saying it was confusing. If you are someone who pays attention don't let the reviews...scare you. The story makes perfectly fine sense and is not hard to follow in my opinion. The animation is beautiful and the art is stunning. The portrayal of emotions is especially superb. I'm sad to see this anime not get the attention it deserves but am very happy I decided to watch it anyway. I have essentially nothing negative to say about the anime. I loved it. I Don't throw a 10 at everything. I'm a generally positive reviewer but I think this anime was truly special. If you are on the fence. Just watch it. scare you.

I'm fond of Okada's scope in this film, and while it's not her strongest piece of individual character writing (that would be her directorial debut), this breathes new optimism into values humanity has always held in high regard. The excitement of growth and the broadening...of one's horizons are predominant in the assertive nature of the screenplay. I would argue the film's greatest strength is firmly retaining its frenetic survivalist tendencies throughout its runtime, particularly because the leads rarely cave into the despair of circumstance. The cast is diverse; some are beyond eccentric, crafting a holistic angle on the tumultuous fantastical disaster that the quiet industrial town is faced with.maboroshi's structure is slightly unorthodox, and the plot slowly answers certain questions at unlikely times, maybe even slipping past an unattentive viewer. It's an interesting mechanic because practically nothing is left unrevealed, albeit the bits of context may boast differing levels of clarity, yet nonetheless, there is indeed an explanation for the mental turmoil stirred by supernatural phenomena. I found the themes of divine punishment to be a clever contrast to the film also posing realistic justifications, and both sides may be mere sophistry disguising the irreversible illusion of time. The viewer's inability to discern the legitimate relationship between the steel factory and the film's ultimate premise is part of the intended goal, as we're aware of the cause and effects but not quite the tangible connection. This approach to abstract leitmotifs is far from Okada's style; on the contrary, she's literal about interpersonal struggles. Whereas this film is much more reserved for the greater part of the first two acts, underpinning a portrait of collective solitude while simultaneously redefining the term.From what I understand, unlike her prior works that precariously explore similar areas of insecurity, maboroshi is significantly more personal. There is a sense of intimacy that she applies to the script, their blank stares, and the roaring intensity of suffocating in open space. Okada's 2018 autobiography, From Truant to Anime Screenwriter, describes herself as a truant, a common case of severe social isolation and depression. The novel's overarching message details her attachment to the past, giving form to her anxiety during a period of expected exuberance. One could argue that translating these raw emotions sways the narrative unevenly, and it's difficult to not agree with that observation because multiple instances of spontaneity disconnect the viewer with what I would argue are deliberately uncomfortable moments. It wouldn't be too far-fetched to hold the emotional immaturity against the rest of the resolution; however, the visual storytelling operates with honest splendor. The integration of relatively simple mindsets supersedes the cryptic setting.Mappa's production values aren't necessarily the most noteworthy element; more so, the staff has managed to build impressive technical qualities. The quality of character acting in crucial segments is high, exhibiting micromovements and subtlety to highlight minor glances and moods. Both movement and freeform character animation are often present, characterizing the idiosyncracies of realism. It's weaker in the layout department, and some of the CG environments aren't blended as well as I would have liked, not to mention that I find the locations underused as a whole. Generally speaking, the audiovisual storytelling capitalizes on color consistency rather than background detail, and it coordinates scenes around the mild urbanization of the town. The audio has solid use of non-diegetic sound with varying levels of effectiveness in the score, although the incorporation of 90s tracks was a great choice.

I guess the movie just knew how to get to me emotionally while still trying to put some effort in its story.I understand that the plot can be hard to follow and how the logic makes sense in its setting, but this like a Your Name thing where it does prioritize evoking strong emotions over trying to succeed in its seemingly complex storyline.What really made this work for me is its how effective it managed to pull off that youthful angst that I keep craving for every time. It's cheesily...romantic and dumb at times, but it's that unapologetic approach that makes it endearing for me.I also like how it touches on themes of grief and just feeling stuck and hopeless in life, which comes as no surprise given how much angst the movie has in spades. It tries to be hopeful in the end albeit I wish it wrapped things up in a more satisfying conclusion.The animation and character designs are pure eye candy as to be expected from MAPPA, even the haters will at least admit to its visual appeal that can even rival Makoto Shinkai's films.Overall, a pleasant surprise that while not perfect in all fronts, managed to stick the landing in telling a resonant tale of altered realities and the optimistic possibilities of a future that lies ahead beyond those cracks. romantic and dumb at times, but it's that unapologetic approach that makes it endearing for me.I also like how it touches on themes of grief and just feeling stuck and hopeless in life, which comes as no surprise given how much angst the movie has in spades.

Extremely well-crafted, but also totally cringy.Expectations before watching: This popped up out of nowhere on streaming last month, and the premise looks very interesting at least. Also, MAPPA studio has gradually become one of my favorites over the years.The reality: The basic worldbuilding and fantastical elements are very far-fetched, and the main plot is essentially a super cringy story about a toddler getting jealous of her mom for being madly in love with her dad. Seriously? You don\'t need a super convoluted ""Spirited Away"" type setting to tell...a story about family love and pain of growing up.Recommended to: people who have experiences similar to what was portrayed in the movie. (And by that, I acknowledge my own limitations. This movie did not resonate with me, but it might work for others)What worked for me:++ Overall superb art direction, animation and special effects. The colors really brought the otherwise bleak setting to life. MAPPA has again excelled as a leading animation studio of our time.+ Some characters and their arcs are handled with care. The main leads and their romance are not all that bad.+ Initial mystery about the world was intriguing...for a while.What did not work for me:-- Overtly convoluted plot and fantastical mechanics become disservices to the story. If we take Spirited Away as a point of comparison, well, Spirited Away did not explain everything in its mythical setting either, but at least the audience for Spirited Away were not misled to spend too much time cracking the mystery of the spirit realm. Maboroshi, on the other hand, just throws one jargon over another at the audience. At around half point of the movie, my brain went numb and I stopped caring about all the significances and symbolisms beneath it all.-- Like I mentioned, the core of the plot revolving around family bound, love, pain of love, responsibility, growing up and regrets does not have to be so cringe-worthy, yet the way the movie handles Izumi is just too cringe-worthy for me.-- Other awkward elements, including eye-rolling sequences of multiple love triangles and religious snobbishness ultimately lead nowhere. These can be both fun and integral to the story, but sadly they are mostly just there. Maybe if I try a little harder, I can force a coherent interpretation out of them. But I don\'t think it\'s worth it. This movie gets a very low mark in the department of coherence for me.Conclusion: Well, maybe fans of this movie will try to defend it with arguments like ""soft worldbuilding"" ""poetic vibe"" or something in that line. I am fine with such perspectives. Like I always said, please take my review with a whole pack of salt, and there\'s no shame for you to love something that did not work for me. a story about family love and pain of growing up.Recommended to: people who have experiences similar to what was portrayed in the movie. (And by that, I acknowledge my own limitations. This movie did not resonate with me, but it might work for others)What worked for me:++ Overall superb art direction, animation and special effects. The colors really brought the otherwise bleak setting to life. MAPPA has again excelled as a leading animation studio of our time.+ Some characters and their arcs are handled with care. The main leads and their romance are not all that bad.+ Initial mystery about the world was intriguing...for a while.What did not work for me:-- Overtly convoluted plot and fantastical mechanics become disservices to the story. If we take Spirited Away as a point of comparison, well, Spirited Away did not explain everything in its mythical setting either, but at least the audience for Spirited Away were not misled to spend too much time cracking the mystery of the spirit realm. Maboroshi, on the other hand, just throws one jargon over another at the audience. At around half point of the movie, my brain went numb and I stopped caring about all the significances and symbolisms beneath it all.-- Like I mentioned, the core of the plot revolving around family bound, love, pain of love, responsibility, growing up and regrets does not have to be so cringe-worthy, yet the way the movie handles Izumi is just too cringe-worthy for me.-- Other awkward elements, including eye-rolling sequences of multiple love triangles and religious snobbishness ultimately lead nowhere. These can be both fun and integral to the story, but sadly they are mostly just there. Maybe if I try a little harder, I can force a coherent interpretation out of them. But I don\'t think it\'s worth it. This movie gets a very low mark in the department of coherence for me.Conclusion: Well, maybe fans of this movie will try to defend it with arguments like ""soft worldbuilding"" ""poetic vibe"" or something in that line. I am fine with such perspectives. Like I always said, please take my review with a whole pack of salt, and there\'s no shame for you to love something that did not work for me.']"

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

The trailer outlined what the movie was about and showed every good scene in the movie. Every other scene was rather sub par.Story:The story revolves around Akane getting kidnapped and Ranma... and company going to save her. This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits. In fact the credits were the best part of this movie.Overall I won\'t hold this movie against Ranma 1/2 in general, in fact I\'m interested in checking the show out now.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

This concept isn\'t too interesting or original but it had...potential if they had spent as much time developing the story and characters as they did writing bad jokes. Yes, I realize Ranma 1/2 is a comedy, but this movie wasn\'t funny. Every single joke fell flat and often intruded upon what should have been very serious scenes. Every time the movie started to take it self seriously it felt the need to throw in a joke to lighten things up and it took all the suspense away.Animation:The animation at first looked passable for a movie made in the early 90s but it appears they spent the entire animation budget in the first half of the movie. When it came time for the climax the best the movie had to offer was cartoony flashes of colour on the screen. Almost any episode of Dragonball looks better with a tv budget then this looked with a movie budget. At least the characters designs were nice.Sound:As I watched this movie on an English VHS tape it should go without saying that I watched the Dub, and I don\'t believe any of the actors gave a damn. The performances almost all fell flat especially male Ranma when ever he screamed or shouted. The facial animation would tell one story while the sound coming out of his mouth would tell a completely, less believable, sound. The only performances I could stand were Girl Ranma and Akane and even they sounded phoned in. The music was mostly forgettable aside from the song ""It\'s Love"" in the end credits.

That being said, don\'t watch this movie, It\'s not worth it.', 'I am putting this out here only because this film seems to have a couple ""Not Recommended "" and a ""Mixed Feelings"" at the time of this writing.The release of this film in the U.S. coincided with Viz Media release of Season 3 and Season 4 of the Ranma 1/2 series. I highly recommend watching this film after Season 5 of the regular series; this gave me the strong impression of where this movie falls within the timeline.I felt this film was incredibly funny and has the usual Ranma 1/2 tropes. This involves the characters traveling from Japan to Mainland China to pull Akane from...yet another problem that can only be experienced in this particular Anime. The large cast of Characters that join Ranma always seem to impede him in some way, but he still surmounts the odds to reach his beloved Akane.The fight scenes are really great. The ending fight feels like the original Bruce Lee\'s Game of Death with Ranma having to pass a specified number of gates (instead of climbing floors as in ""Game of Death""), battling foes until he finally reaches the ""Big Bad Guy"". Ranma faces the ""Baddie"" one-on-one and figures out a unique way to defeat the enemy that is signature of this series.Honestly, what is one hour of your time? I promise you will enjoy this film and have as much as good time as I did along with the regular series. yet another problem that can only be experienced in this particular Anime.
