Ichigo Mashimaro Episode 0,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4156/Ichigo_Mashimaro_Episode_0,"[""Ichigo Mashimaro Episode 0 is basically a 5 minute short about the girls in outer space. It&rsquo;s funny because this title was made after the series (Ichigo Mashimaro) aired, yet they are together with a girl named Ana, and they didn&rsquo;t end up meeting her until episode 2 of the series. Anyway, the story is sweet and to the point, (yet nothing really too spectacular) the girls house has been made into a space craft, and they are trying to make it home before their oxygen runs out. You can really tell that this short was only made as a side dish for the fans,...since nothing is really explained about how the girls got to space in the first place. Because the series didn't have a space theme, and was simply a slice of life anime. (For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with it)The background music is sparse, in fact a good portion of the time there really is no BG whatsoever. The only real notable track is that space symphony theme that plays in many other shows, I am sure you have all heard it before. (Dun dun...dun dun) And while I do feel it enhances some of the moods in the short, it would have been nice to actually have had at least some other tracks to go with it! Still, what they do have there is good! The Japanese voice cast are the same ones from the series, every girl was matched perfectly with the appropriate voice over. Whether it be Ana&rsquo;s soft sweet voice or Nobue&rsquo;s more layed back personality.The characters are very likable, while they don&rsquo;t have the most deep or versatile personalities (like a girl named Miu has), but they at least never come off as annoying. In fact all the personalities that have been given to each girl is pulled off sweet and charming. They really know how to interact with each other well! Sadly the only people you&rsquo;ll see in this short are the main cast themselves. Though it&rsquo;s only 5 minutes so it should be that big of a deal, especially if you have never seen the series before.The art is soft and cuteness at its best. Nothing is ever &quot;overly&quot; detailed that it comes off as too much for the eyes to take. Color and art are focused on the characters themselves, while the backgrounds look more along the lines of soft water color paintings. It does have a nice appeal to it, but certainly isn&rsquo;t the most well detailed series out there. As the clothing and backgrounds have a much more plain look to them, still it is nice to look at.Being that it's so short it just wasn't able to capture the charm of the series, yet the humor was still pretty good. If you don&rsquo;t like big helpings of cute, then I doubt this one will make you change your mind, but if you have never seen the series before, and love all things kawaii...then I recommend trying this out to see if you like it. Since its a good taste of what the series has to offer. (Minus the space theme of course) A cute little adventure indeed! since nothing is really explained about how the girls got to space in the first place.

Ichigo Mashimaro is a series that relies on slice-of-life humor and a whole ton of moe. The cute and hyper visuals lend a lot into the humor and characterization, thus that's why Claim a...Loli Club has Ichigo Mashimaro as an anime relation.Episode 0 goes into science-fiction territory, referencing to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I believe we all know where this is going: nowhere.I love science-fiction a lot, but Ichigo Mashimaro Episode 0 is no sci-fi work. The humor feels bland and unfunny; the characters feel out-of-place because, well, they are slice-of-life characters in the first place.I beg people starting Ichigo Mashimaro to start episode 1 instead of 0. Indeed, episode 0 is short, but watch it later if you must. Episode 1 introduces the characters and sets the humor and setting unlike episode 0. Episode 0 is a terrible extra that confuses newcomers and more.Now, if you excuse me, I must put Miu-chan at bay.

There's really not a lot to it other than that. It is funny, it is plain, a little self-aware. This really just exists for people who have seen the manga to be honest (prior to the TV anime whilst also playing with characters whose personalities are already known). It doesn't make too much sense on its own, but it is watchable if you are new to the series. There are no spoilers or anything like that, but it becomes apparent later on as to why...X and Y happen when you understand how the characters behave as they did. I watched this before I watched anything else, and there was really no problem. Maybe you could rewatch it after the entire thing, but that is on you.No real point in watching this short, but it is 4 minutes long. Not really a lot to lose with this one.

Jarinko Chie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3946/Jarinko_Chie,"[""There are very few words needed to describe this movie. Let's say, it is a classic Takahata.Do not go in there expecting an emotionally heavy movie like 'Grave of the Fireflies' or even something fantastical like 'Tales of Princess Kaguya'. These movies were magnificent but you cannot compare them to Jarinko Chie because they aren't of the same genre and they aren't trying to achieve the same thing.'Chie' belongs to the same category as 'My Neighbours The Yamadas', meaning, for this genre, it is one of the best you can get out there. This movie is mature, it is deep but it is...very well directed so that it is light and funny with just a pinch of drama. The story is simple and it is just as poignant as any other because that's a story which you believe, which you know can happen, which you know has happened. It is your average dysfunctional family, trying to get back together. This movie has characters who are real and believable and likable. They all have flaws and they all have their distinguished idiosyncrasies and they all come out as fully developed human beings which you can never get enough of.Sure, technical wise, it is nothing like 'Fireflies' but the style of the animation suits the mood of the story and the quality is actually pretty high. For the dub, the Japanese did a wonderful job but, and I'm gonna say this knowing that many might disagree or even be completely unaware of it, I believe the French dub is really good as well. Trust me, I'm a very demanding person when it comes to dubs and I must give credit where credit is due. The French dub was amazing.At the end of the day, 'Jarinko Chie' is just a pleasant story that you can watch over and over again because the characters are so true to themselves and you can easily relate to them. This was a movie of my childhood and shall forever remain my favourite from the master Takahata. very well directed so that it is light and funny with just a pinch of drama.

Ajin Part 2 OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36625/Ajin_Part_2_OVA,"[""This is an episode centered on Sato and his time in the army. An origin to his love for carnage and slaughter is shown in this episode and it makes you sorry that series weren't that much centered on action. The quality of the story is better in this episode than in the whole series in my opinion. Sato is a monster, yeah, but he is a fascinating monster. And after watching this epiode, I understood that I wouldn't mind having the whole series from Sato's POV rather than from Nagai's which is a very bad main character in my opinion, because it takes too...long for him to form his own character and by the time he does, two seasons of the series have passed. Maybe he improves in unavoidable third season, when it comes sometimes in the future. Anyway, I give this episode a 8/10!

His fascination with Ajin, after his unit is involved in one of the first captures, makes him a psychopath in waiting. But it's when he's stationed in Africa that the real chaos with Fox ensues, changing the course of human history.Satou is right - the problem with Ajin is that you never know until you die. They look and act like us, making it a seductive idea for someone like Fox, a super-soldier who is bored with his job. Fox is willing...to take the ultimate test and effectively becomes an Ajin after he's dishonorably discharged for going rogue during a mission. For someone like Satou, being an Ajin is the greatest gift available - an unending supply of extra lives.

And Sato already has a problem of being a one note character, which this OVA furthers even more. It just feels reductive and repetitive.Overall the technical quality is the same as the main series, and if you super love Ajin you can give it a shot. It's only 1 normal episode lenght, so it won't take too much of your time. But overall I think it was...very boring and skippable. very boring and skippable.""]"

It has really been almost a decade huh... well if you’re impatient for Season 2 of it, then you better check out Jahy-sama, which is a pretty underrated show this season. It's surprising to see its rating pretty low... at 7.18 (as of editing this review at Sept. 15)In short words, Jahy-sama is literally Part-Timer... but the main character is a loli.

It\'s the anime equivalent of putting your ear next to a fax machine for 20 minutes. There is literally nothing of real value on display; the art is mediocre and the animation is stiff, even for a seasonal FOTM ""comedy"" and the jokes are so far from landing you can\'t even hear the impact. The story and characters are about as deep as a mountain.Another thing is the fact that every single joke has the exact same punchline and execution;...someone does something goofy or something bad happens and the characters obnoxiously shriek about it to explain the joke to the audience in case we weren\'t capable of comprehending the truly masterful utilization of comedy and pretense. I know this is (apparently) a staple of Japanese humor but they repeat this joke format like fifteen times in a single episode.

This anime is dumb, but in a good way, it's a nice escape from other animes.I'll make this short, this show has semi-low lows and kinda high highs. The first few episodes may be repetitive and kinda boring, and I think they could have done better at expositions, but as the show progressed it got pretty good. The jokes may not be for everyone, but that's not all to the...comedy aspect. It's main comedy focuses on the over-expressive characters and the sheer stupidity of some situations. The show's main high point is the character growth and relationships, they are surprisingly satisfying to watch.So, the show focuses on the daily struggles of the Great Jahy, the Demon Realm's No.2, as she gets reverse-isekaied to Japan. And she has 1 goal in mind, to resurrect the Demon Realm, it's literally written on her shirt. She works hard, hits some lows, but soon grows to like the earth. She grows to love the people around her and learns to show selflessness to help others, as she was helped.My only complaints are that the exposition portion was repetitive, the comedy falls flat sometimes, and the rest of the cast could have gotten more development or growth. I would've wanted to see conflict that wasn't just from landlady, but that's about it.The characters are dumb, but that's the point is it not? They are so absurd that it becomes funny to watch their interactions with Jahy. Shop owner is too nice, that she gets anyone to love her. Landlady is too normal, actually the only rational person, which is kinda her joke. Druj is just dumb when it comes to Jahy, and I actually really like their interactions, since Jahy changes back to Demon Realm mode. Kyouko was a very interesting and mysterious character, but her character has nice depth to it, and like Druj, her weakness is Jahy. Kokoro, gives the show a nice wholesome vibe, she's too pure and all of us, including Jahy, want to protect her. Last is Salwa (best girl, fight me) she adds depth on the Demon Realm stuff and it's really funny to see her fail (that sounded wrong).Overall, this anime was a ride, it had its fiar share of flaws, but pulled through in the end.

Alright, now with that out of the way let’s continue.I am not the type of person to get hyped for things. I have only ever felt minor excitement for new or continuing, video games, anime series, book series, manga series, albums, or nature documentaries. However, I felt a moderate amount of hype for Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! Upon reflecting on why I felt this way, I concluded that it was because this was the first time I have ever read the manga before watching the anime. An unimportant...detail for you maybe, but a new event for me. Now I understand how dangerous hype can be, if I allowed myself to expect too much, I would have been let down regardless of how good the final product would be. However, level-headedness prevailed. So, I can safely say that this is a good adaptation. Sure the animation could be better, but, I can still recognize that the story and the sound in Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai are lovely. You might not like this type of iyashikei anime like I do, but if you do, you are definitely in for something special. 8/10.*Spoilers beyond this point*The story of Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! is about pain, suffering, bills, and half victories.From struggling to grow a tomato plant, to paying rent, from finding mystic gems in the ocean to getting lost in the wooded area behind her apartment. It just makes me happy. Watching every week to see The Marvelous Misadventures of Jahy really warmed my heart this summer and fall. Even though I liked the story, there are problems. Including one of my biggest pet peeves, a character being physically different and others having no comment about it. Jahy, Salwa, and Druj ann have pointy ears, but all of the humans don’t seem to mind. It would be one of my first questions. “What’s up with your ears there small child? Why do they remind me of Legolas?” But that’s only a pet peeve and not a major problem. A real problem I have with the story is that the magical girl and Jahy becoming (very) fast friends make no sense. Yeah, Jahy sees part of herself in the magical girl (pain, suffering, half victories, and so on), but she still destroyed the demon realm. I would still be absolutely furious if someone destroyed Earth and then wanted to be my friend. Another thing I really did not like is the rushed ending. The entire climax took only one and a half episodes, and it was also anti-climatic. It’s a real shame because it could have been a better one given proper time. Finally, I am in two minds about skipping the whole “Hi, I’m Jahy, the Deamon Realm’s number two, now give me a job and a place to stay.” On one hand, it is nice to get right into the show without the introductions, but on the other, I think it would be nice to see the introductions.One of the things that might upset the Jahy-sama manga readers alone is that the anime is not a shot-for-shot remake of the manga. Some parts are added, or removed, or changed from the manga. Most of these changes don’t really bother me, but the one thing that did was the fact that they took out some of the meme images that the manga spawned. This is disappointing not only because they would be funny to see in motion, but also they could make people want to watch the show. A thing that bothered me, and maybe nobody else on this planet, is that the anime showed Jahy at the bathhouse, but then waited to show Salwa’s perspective in the next episode. It should have been one after another to help the flow.When this adaptation was announced in mid to late April, I hoped that Kyoto Animation would be behind this adaptation. But, instead, we got Silver Link. Now, I have seen some of Silver Link’s work before, and I found the animation ranging from very good to okay. And I can safely say that the animation in Jahy-sama lands considerably in the good section. Not okay, not very good, but good. The colors are nice and vibrant and the color pallet is nice and consistent. So, this leads to a very nice comedy anime adaptation. The colors and some of the animation looks good in both OPs and EDs. However, I do have serious criticisms with the animation. When a person moves, the arms, legs, head, or the whole body moves either as a blur or in a snap motion. Now a lot of anime do this, but what really gets me is when these animation problems are in the OP or ED. These are critical animation parts of the anime because it is what the viewer sees at the beginning and end of every episode. Also, it is the same 90-second loop. Silver Link really should have put more effort and time into these OPs and EDs. I would have scored the animation lower, but I really enjoyed the good parts of the visuals in both of the OP and both EDs.Not only did I like some of the visuals of the second OP and both EDs, but I also loved the music in all four of them. All four songs were upbeat and catchy. They fit very well with the bright and vibrant colors of the show. The voice actors chosen to portray these characters are all fantastic too. The voices of all of the characters fit very well, and when I read the manga, I thought that they would have very similar voices. However, I also believe that there was room for improvement. I would of have had all of the voice actors go a bit further when voice acting their characters. For example, I believe the store manager should have leaned a bit more into the motherly “ara ara~” archetype. Also, I would have made adult Jahy’s voice a little deeper, a little more commanding, and a little more confident than it is. Since this is a comedy anime, I don’t think the voice acting quality would be compromised by these slight changes.Watching Jahy go from “For the love of the Dark Lord, why do I have to be around all of you moronic humans?!” to “Yeah. I guess you guys are my friends.” Seeing her slowly change throughout this season is not only better done than quite a few other anime, but also really fun to watch. The magical girl also has some character development. Although, it is not very extensive. She goes from foe to an obsessed friend. Her interactions with Jahy are fun to watch too. While only Jahy and the magical girl are the deepest characters, the other characters are fun and/or interesting.Honestly, even though I have criticisms with all aspects of this show, I still loved it. Watching Jahy and her band of colorful friends fumble about daily life, really warmed my heart. There were days when I really looked forward to Saturdays because I knew that a new episode of Jahy-sama was waiting for me at home. Now, not everyone has the same taste as me. So, this anime won’t before everyone. However, if you like this type of iyashikei anime like I do, you are in for something special. I walked away from this anime feeling satisfied, happy, and hopeful for another season. Overall, the characters, and animation get a 7, the story an 8, and the sound and entertainment a 9. For a final score of 8/10. detail for you maybe, but a new event for me. Now I understand how dangerous hype can be, if I allowed myself to expect too much, I would have been let down regardless of how good the final product would be. However, level-headedness prevailed. So, I can safely say that this is a good adaptation. Sure the animation could be better, but, I can still recognize that the story and the sound in Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai are lovely. You might not like this type of iyashikei anime like I do, but if you do, you are definitely in for something special. 8/10.*Spoilers beyond this point*The story of Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! is about pain, suffering, bills, and half victories.From struggling to grow a tomato plant, to paying rent, from finding mystic gems in the ocean to getting lost in the wooded area behind her apartment. It just makes me happy. Watching every week to see The Marvelous Misadventures of Jahy really warmed my heart this summer and fall. Even though I liked the story, there are problems. Including one of my biggest pet peeves, a character being physically different and others having no comment about it. Jahy, Salwa, and Druj ann have pointy ears, but all of the humans don’t seem to mind. It would be one of my first questions. “What’s up with your ears there small child? Why do they remind me of Legolas?” But that’s only a pet peeve and not a major problem. A real problem I have with the story is that the magical girl and Jahy becoming (very) fast friends make no sense. Yeah, Jahy sees part of herself in the magical girl (pain, suffering, half victories, and so on), but she still destroyed the demon realm. I would still be absolutely furious if someone destroyed Earth and then wanted to be my friend. Another thing I really did not like is the rushed ending. The entire climax took only one and a half episodes, and it was also anti-climatic. It’s a real shame because it could have been a better one given proper time. Finally, I am in two minds about skipping the whole “Hi, I’m Jahy, the Deamon Realm’s number two, now give me a job and a place to stay.” On one hand, it is nice to get right into the show without the introductions, but on the other, I think it would be nice to see the introductions.One of the things that might upset the Jahy-sama manga readers alone is that the anime is not a shot-for-shot remake of the manga. Some parts are added, or removed, or changed from the manga. Most of these changes don’t really bother me, but the one thing that did was the fact that they took out some of the meme images that the manga spawned. This is disappointing not only because they would be funny to see in motion, but also they could make people want to watch the show. A thing that bothered me, and maybe nobody else on this planet, is that the anime showed Jahy at the bathhouse, but then waited to show Salwa’s perspective in the next episode. It should have been one after another to help the flow.When this adaptation was announced in mid to late April, I hoped that Kyoto Animation would be behind this adaptation. But, instead, we got Silver Link. Now, I have seen some of Silver Link’s work before, and I found the animation ranging from very good to okay. And I can safely say that the animation in Jahy-sama lands considerably in the good section. Not okay, not very good, but good. The colors are nice and vibrant and the color pallet is nice and consistent. So, this leads to a very nice comedy anime adaptation. The colors and some of the animation looks good in both OPs and EDs. However, I do have serious criticisms with the animation. When a person moves, the arms, legs, head, or the whole body moves either as a blur or in a snap motion. Now a lot of anime do this, but what really gets me is when these animation problems are in the OP or ED. These are critical animation parts of the anime because it is what the viewer sees at the beginning and end of every episode. Also, it is the same 90-second loop. Silver Link really should have put more effort and time into these OPs and EDs. I would have scored the animation lower, but I really enjoyed the good parts of the visuals in both of the OP and both EDs.Not only did I like some of the visuals of the second OP and both EDs, but I also loved the music in all four of them. All four songs were upbeat and catchy. They fit very well with the bright and vibrant colors of the show. The voice actors chosen to portray these characters are all fantastic too. The voices of all of the characters fit very well, and when I read the manga, I thought that they would have very similar voices. However, I also believe that there was room for improvement. I would of have had all of the voice actors go a bit further when voice acting their characters. For example, I believe the store manager should have leaned a bit more into the motherly “ara ara~” archetype.

This new world is void of magic or any royalty/peasantry status so Jahy is forced to succumb to the work culture in order to make ends meet while also finding red crystals to repair the demon realm. As Jahy becomes more accustomed to this new world she finds it isn\'t as bad as she initially thought and befriends many humans; She also finds many comrades who have become successful or just...plain lazy. The great Jahy will never be defeated is a fun and playful comedy reverse-isekai with a lot of promise, will Jahy be able to repair the demon realm or will she prefer the new life as a bar waitress?Story & Characters: 7/10The story at first didn\'t appear interesting but after watching the first few episodes, I was hooked. Although comedy is a large element in the show, there are underlying elements like plot and narrative goal as well as fairly clear world building. Jahy is a playful take on good vs evil and shows us that change in environment and personal influence can have a significant impact on a person\'s way of life. After many hardships and successes, Jahy grows to find that there is more to this new world and grows fond of its people. However, that isn\'t all the story; Despite its comedic appeal the great Jahy has an unpredictable storyline with bad people becoming good and good people becoming bad - It doesn\'t have the level of violence as other demons series but it raises an interesting idea that ""yesterday\'s enemy is today\'s friend"". After Jahy transports she has many fights which usually end in a stalemate where she drops the rivalry and befrienss her enemies. I really enjoyed this approach instead of losing a character to her own character development. Many of the human characters in the great Jahy aren\'t scared of Jahy but instead help her in hard times or even fight her which may be the biggest influence in her change of demeanor. Overall, the story is more playful and doesn\'t unnecessarily kill characters for the main character\'s development.Art & Sound: 7/10The art style is good quality the animation as well for that matter. The character designs for Jahy are generally on the moe-side and in adult form it\'s more explorative. I enjoyed the set designs because they\'re consistent throughout the entire show as well as a lot of the character designs. The art tends to fall apart in wide shots and series itself implements a lot of wide shots but they and the slideshow animation don\'t devolve the overall visual experience as much as I thought they would.Some of the music in this series is used to sound adventurous and fun which is a good approach. Many of Jahy\'s hardships come from her ability to transform into an adult so in her child form there is a lot more comedic elements at disposal on her and sound is one of the better elements used. The voice acting is suitable and very entertaining especially from the landlady, Jahy and the hero.Overall & Enjoyment: 7/10I\'m glad I was able to watch this show; There are a lot of flaws with this type of show like its comedy delaying a lot of plot progression especially in the beginning or some events feeling longer than expected. However, overall I really did enjoy the friction build up especially toward the end of the show with the Demon Lord and Justice. plain lazy.

From the animation to the soundtrack, from the pacing to the comedy timing, anything that could make something of quality was thrown out of the window from the episode 1, because apparently using the voices of Aqua, Subaru and Nenechi in the ED was enough to attract the viewers to this pathetic experienceAnything that I can say in this...review is not harsh enough, the amount of laziness and carelessness is just beyond the shamelessness of the medium, to the point that I could imagine them laughing at every single preventable error, thinking about the crappy quality of their product, and I wouldn’t blame them, I would laugh too. The main offender of this whole train wreck is the animation, which is a complete waste of electric energy and any natural resource used to create this, and I mean human resources too. I could understand that some innocent mind would say “Dude, this anime doesn’t need a big bucks animation”, and I gently agree, but I’m not talking about big flashy bangs cumload highlight reel animation, I’m talking about basic human decency animation, I’m talking about not doing a terrorist attack to the fundamentals of art. To exemplify this, I would go to the most pathetic example (Spoilers ahead), the fight between Jahy and the Mahou Shoujo. The fight between Jahy and the Mahou Shoujo featured a background with some random ass stairs, those random ass stairs, that didn’t even play a role in the whole scene, had a different size and inclination at each single take, fisting any sort of theory about perspective, could that be a joke that played with the absolute ass quality of the fight? Is the trashiness warping the time-space? I don’t know, but it was jarring to see, to the point that it is obvious that they noticed and didn’t even care about fixing it (And I’m talking about a static background, take it for granted that the figures of the characters are just cardboard shapes). Such fight is not an isolated case, the concept of perspective just doesn’t exist in the strange world of Jahy-sama, we get random texts that are supposedly attached to doors floating in space because they didn’t even rotate them accordingly to place them correctly, we get characters being three times their supposed size because they just copy-pasted them, is this a consequence about the destruction of the Dark Realm? I hope it is, but these preventable errors are just a sample of how negligent about anything this anime is.Sadly, the negligence affects the comedy too. In this case I just don’t know about how the manga treats the comedy, but I suppose that the composition of it would make the experience bearable because you can fast-forward through it without dragging the intended joke, drawing your attention correctly between the panels or whatnot. Sadly, this doesn’t work in anime, you need to guide the viewer through an established time to present the punchline in a precise moment, giving them enough time to elaborate the narrative but not enough time to decipher the whole scheme. For sure, this anime gives you enough time to understand the narration, you can make a tea, do a marathon, play some Wii Sports inspired by the blatant copy of the soundtrack, 56, 24, 36, and the punchline is still waiting to be delivered. It is just unbelievable. The anime drags every single punchline to the point that I’m sure that the people who directed this are just comedy talibans, in a mission of destroying every single ounce of fun that can be generated through the apparently set of worthful ideas. Is this a consequence of the animation? I would say it is, if you drag the punchline to mental asylum levels you can play more with still frames that brings absolutely nothing to the joke, incorporate less scenery, cutting every single corner. This works sometimes because it adds suspense, or because the joke benefits from being dragged a bit longer, but most of the time the joke is the fact that we are supposed to laugh at something that can be seen from the ISSThe agonizing dumpster fire of the execution of this anime can just be saved by the interactions between the characters, which brings some remarkable points, portraying ideas about how we perceive themselves in relation to the others, how we define what is important to us, how we define the expectations of the others over us, or a simple innocent misunderstanding that allows us to perceive a touch of sincerity, with the envelope of enjoying the journey and accepting each other.  Can that redeem the efforts of the talibans? No, of course not, the anime is supposed to be a comedy, the anime presents itself as a comedy, the energy is the one of a comedy, and the comedy is car bombed by the production. This anime just doesn’t work unless you want to see a loli transforming into a succubus and some random girls with huge milkers that can serve as your company before sleep. At such point of audiovisual mediocrity, why would you watch this instead of reading some quality hentai?

It has all the basic requirements for it and it just does it wellThis is pretty much why this is a benchmark animeThe “GOOD” iyashiki anime where any other iyashiki anime  below this is bad and above this is greatJahy sama is basically benchmark since it is uh let’s say “inspired” to use the tropes of the more out there iyashiki , like the very famous kobayashi’s maid dragon.

But is this show more than enough to warrant watching this weekly and tirelessly for the 5 months while this aired? Let\'s find out.The adaptation from mangaka Wakame Konbu\'s work of the same name, and you can immediately put two and two together why I and so many others compare this to...Hataraku Maou-sama!. Jahy-sama operates on two phases, since this is a 5-month, 20-episode long 2-cour series: the Magical Girl side covering the 1st half, and the Dark Lord side covering the 2nd half.At the very beginning, the reverse-Isekai features that are akin to Hataraku Maou-sama! plays out like you\'d expect: a demon being (in this case, a demon girl) that has her world powered by the mana crystals (that gives strength to the Dark Realm) that\'s shattered by the Magical Girl, only to fall from grace into the human world as a childlike being but a loli (because all demons instantly lose their powers) to go and gather them to restore the Dark Realm, once and for all. The plot is as simple as that, but the only thing that the Great Jahy has obstructing her path is the Magical Girl a.k.a Kyouko Jingu whom destroyed her world in the first place, and is attempting to do the same in the human world. Thankfully, the Great Jahy-sama does not do this alone, and has her subordinate Druj a.k.a Nana Dojima to help her out, except that she\'s a wealthy woman leading a consultant company as its president, and that Druj has all the wealth to assist Jahy in finding the mana crystals. While all of this is going on, Jahy has to find a way to make her daily life useful, so she is taken in by the Ara-Ara store manager of the pub known as ""Craft Pub Maou"" while being forced to live in a run-down apartment that\'s run by the landlord, her sister Ryou. Oh, and plus the tremendously idiotic and hilarious Salwa, whose inventive plans and strategies always ends up failing due to her carelessness. This is actually not a bad start to the series, considering that if you have watched Hataraku Maou-sama! before, you would already know how all this worked out before with the supernatural setting and the comedy attached to it. A great 1st half if you ask me.Alas, being a 2-cour show, once the inclusion of the Dark Lord (the 1st-in-command) enters the highway, this I feel just took the show in a worse direction. The only good thing that came out of it was the inclusion of Kokoro, this innocent-looking elementary school girl that Jahy notices that she could be her next subordinate in helping her find more mana crystals. The Demon Lord character isn\'t bad, but looking at the way of her reaction being a non-talkative demon while simultaneously being a glutton of all things and taken care of by the Magical Girl, she\'s basically a mute that only responds to the things of like. Sadly though, mangaka Wakame Konbu\'s writing also suffers from constant repetitiveness of its gags and jokes, that once you\'ve already seen it a few times before, you already know what to expect, and it doesn\'t take long for the comedy to become so stale and boring. So, I would say a great start that boggled down by the progression of the source material, adding characters that are essential to the series while putting a backburner on the comedy side. It\'s not an after-thought since it has already been established right from the get-go.The Great Jahy-sama as a character can seem overwhelming at first glance because of her nonchalant behaviour to quickly get things done back to the original state with her confidence, vigor, and ambitions, and that is how we\'re supposed to see her from the start. It\'s only overtime that characters like the Ara-Ara store manager and the landlord (Ryou) sisters begin to open Jahy\'s hardened heart to softness and compassion towards the humans, the most significant of them being the innocent Kokoro which sees her as not just an ally but as a friend, that opens up Jahy\'s character development. The others like Jahy\'s former assistant Druj though, as much as she is the head of the conglomerate company she is leading as the president (which means money isn\'t a big problem), she is simply a genius character who carries all the great comedy being one that\'s in love with how Jahy treats her like a S&M, that even better, is VA-ed by the one and only HanaKana, which absolutely fits her character to the T. The battle to the death against the Magical Girl Kyouko Jingu, I\'d fathom that Jahy doesn\'t even need to retaliate too much despite the fact that she destroyed the Dark Realm in the first place, because she is a parody of a hero character, a klutz out to save people from their misfortunes. The more mana crystals that she collects, the greater the karma of bad luck. Even more detrimental is Salwa (or Saurva if you wish) who aims to take Jahy\'s place as the 2nd-in-command, and you can think of her as the sidekick to present some kind of rivalry that her plans constantly goes awry each and every single time. A decent character to break the mold, but not by much.Production-wise, don\'t expect too much from the decent studio that is Silver Link, and as much as the quality is concerned for long-running shows like this one, director Mirai Minato and his staff team (which surprisingly has hit-or-miss series composer Michiko Yokote onboard) did their best to keep it decent without being too flashy, because really, this show doesn\'t need that glamour. Sound-wise, this is also another show where I\'d find that the former half\'s OST is the much better one compared to the latter half in every single regard. I mean, Yui Ogura\'s OP and the NEGI☆U Hololive ED were the perfect starter OST songs set for the show, giving it the appeal that the show really needed to stand out from the outset. While Sumire Uesaka\'s OP and Miho Okazaki\'s ED for the 2nd set ain\'t bad, it felt like a significant downgrade from seriousness to all-play mechanics. Remember that this is a show that\'s set on comedy roots, and I must say that I\'m kinda disappointed that the show took an abrupt turn even on aspects that felt even the most minor.Overall, I\'d feel that this show could\'ve been made as just a 1-cour 12/13 episode production, and since that would\'ve been enough for fans to clamor for another season of Jahy-sama, I\'d guess that stretching this to a 2-cour made the most sense to encapsulate the entire (translated) source material (as of the posting of this review). Also, because of its weird starting date 1 month exact into the Summer season in August, while there\'s clear Ws and Ls about this move, the distinction is that Jahy-sama, as good as it can get for a mime-ified version of Hataraku Maou-sama!, while feeling sub-standardly inferior to the former, the enjoyment is as much as the show starts to wear on your patience on the execution of its comedy, which is the constant variable.See to it how you\'d want to enjoy watching The Great Jahy Will NOT Be Defeated!, but it\'s a decent show for me. Hataraku Maou-sama!. Jahy-sama operates on two phases, since this is a 5-month, 20-episode long 2-cour series: the Magical Girl side covering the 1st half, and the Dark Lord side covering the 2nd half.At the very beginning, the reverse-Isekai features that are akin to Hataraku Maou-sama! plays out like you\'d expect: a demon being (in this case, a demon girl) that has her world powered by the mana crystals (that gives strength to the Dark Realm) that\'s shattered by the Magical Girl, only to fall from grace into the human world as a childlike being but a loli (because all demons instantly lose their powers) to go and gather them to restore the Dark Realm, once and for all.

While all of this is going on, Jahy has to find a way to make her daily life useful, so she is taken in by the Ara-Ara store manager of the pub known as ""Craft Pub Maou"" while being forced to live in a run-down apartment that\'s run by the landlord, her sister Ryou. Oh, and plus the tremendously idiotic and hilarious Salwa, whose inventive plans and strategies always ends up failing due to her carelessness. This is actually not a bad start to the series, considering that if you have watched Hataraku Maou-sama! before, you would already know how all this worked out before with the supernatural setting and the comedy attached to it. A great 1st half if you ask me.Alas, being a 2-cour show, once the inclusion of the Dark Lord (the 1st-in-command) enters the highway, this I feel just took the show in a worse direction. The only good thing that came out of it was the inclusion of Kokoro, this innocent-looking elementary school girl that Jahy notices that she could be her next subordinate in helping her find more mana crystals. The Demon Lord character isn\'t bad, but looking at the way of her reaction being a non-talkative demon while simultaneously being a glutton of all things and taken care of by the Magical Girl, she\'s basically a mute that only responds to the things of like. Sadly though, mangaka Wakame Konbu\'s writing also suffers from constant repetitiveness of its gags and jokes, that once you\'ve already seen it a few times before, you already know what to expect, and it doesn\'t take long for the comedy to become so stale and boring. So, I would say a great start that boggled down by the progression of the source material, adding characters that are essential to the series while putting a backburner on the comedy side. It\'s not an after-thought since it has already been established right from the get-go.The Great Jahy-sama as a character can seem overwhelming at first glance because of her nonchalant behaviour to quickly get things done back to the original state with her confidence, vigor, and ambitions, and that is how we\'re supposed to see her from the start. It\'s only overtime that characters like the Ara-Ara store manager and the landlord (Ryou) sisters begin to open Jahy\'s hardened heart to softness and compassion towards the humans, the most significant of them being the innocent Kokoro which sees her as not just an ally but as a friend, that opens up Jahy\'s character development. The others like Jahy\'s former assistant Druj though, as much as she is the head of the conglomerate company she is leading as the president (which means money isn\'t a big problem), she is simply a genius character who carries all the great comedy being one that\'s in love with how Jahy treats her like a S&M, that even better, is VA-ed by the one and only HanaKana, which absolutely fits her character to the T. The battle to the death against the Magical Girl Kyouko Jingu, I\'d fathom that Jahy doesn\'t even need to retaliate too much despite the fact that she destroyed the Dark Realm in the first place, because she is a parody of a hero character, a klutz out to save people from their misfortunes. The more mana crystals that she collects, the greater the karma of bad luck. Even more detrimental is Salwa (or Saurva if you wish) who aims to take Jahy\'s place as the 2nd-in-command, and you can think of her as the sidekick to present some kind of rivalry that her plans constantly goes awry each and every single time. A decent character to break the mold, but not by much.Production-wise, don\'t expect too much from the decent studio that is Silver Link, and as much as the quality is concerned for long-running shows like this one, director Mirai Minato and his staff team (which surprisingly has hit-or-miss series composer Michiko Yokote onboard) did their best to keep it decent without being too flashy, because really, this show doesn\'t need that glamour. Sound-wise, this is also another show where I\'d find that the former half\'s OST is the much better one compared to the latter half in every single regard. I mean, Yui Ogura\'s OP and the NEGI☆U Hololive ED were the perfect starter OST songs set for the show, giving it the appeal that the show really needed to stand out from the outset. While Sumire Uesaka\'s OP and Miho Okazaki\'s ED for the 2nd set ain\'t bad, it felt like a significant downgrade from seriousness to all-play mechanics. Remember that this is a show that\'s set on comedy roots, and I must say that I\'m kinda disappointed that the show took an abrupt turn even on aspects that felt even the most minor.Overall, I\'d feel that this show could\'ve been made as just a 1-cour 12/13 episode production, and since that would\'ve been enough for fans to clamor for another season of Jahy-sama, I\'d guess that stretching this to a 2-cour made the most sense to encapsulate the entire (translated) source material (as of the posting of this review). Also, because of its weird starting date 1 month exact into the Summer season in August, while there\'s clear Ws and Ls about this move, the distinction is that Jahy-sama, as good as it can get for a mime-ified version of Hataraku Maou-sama!, while feeling sub-standardly inferior to the former, the enjoyment is as much as the show starts to wear on your patience on the execution of its comedy, which is the constant variable.See to it how you\'d want to enjoy watching The Great Jahy Will NOT Be Defeated!, but it\'s a decent show for me.', ""Jahy. Oh Jahy.If there were a few lines that I could help describe Jahy, I would use that it's a fun, relatable, wild ride from start to finish. It's comedically timed in parts, to get a good laugh out of the viewer. Through moments, or just some character dynamics, and trough certain situations, which really make it funny considering just the meaning behind it alone, combined with how the characters react within such, really make it priceless.Jahy uses a mix of a story, along with a vast amount of characters that really drive the show home, to make a very enjoyable experience wen...watching such. But not only that, but providing some extra bits by the end of it. You'd feel like you're watching a full episode,as it were a dvd, and then getting some of the extras by the end of it on the same disc. It's great stuff.So with that in mind, let's cover how the show handles shall we?Story and characters.As explained, Jahy has a nice story, but what really pushes it, is it's brand of characters. There is so many animes, that have a story, but their cast are so bland, and their personalities really don't mesh well. But here in Jahy, there is none of that. All of them not only mesh well together, but they make the show come alive. Jahy is a wild and over the top prideful number 2 that wants to return to what she once was. Always geting into wild situations, where that be fighting with her not putting up with her shit, but also good natured landlord, to working with a sweet angel of her store manager. To handling the differences between her footing in the human world from her servant Druj,while trying to ensure her servants vision of her isn't destroyed. All the while trying to avoid a strong and weirdly psychotic in a way magical girl. It's quite the cast.To go on further details upon it's story, it's a pretty simple concept with a great execution. Following a Number 2 demon in Jahy, as she loses her power after her mana crystal was destroyed by the magical girl, as she ends up in the human world, and tries to survive like a normal person, from paying rent, to having a full time job. All the while trying to find mana crystals, in order to restore her power. It's a mixed brand of Slice of life meets fantasy fun that you will just love.Art and Sound.A lot can be said about it's art. While in areas it may look like your typical anime, but some of the shine of it really does show. Where it's the demon world, or even just through Jahy's own eyes. But there are also times were it can seem as if it's dull, or does give off that plain vibe, but it's done right. Can't give enough credit there. While the sounds and the reactions of the characters is not only fit for purpose, but the OP and ending is just really good stuff. I'll for sure always remember it.I'd really recommend giving Jahy a shot, it's bundles of joy from start to finish, and one that I'm glad to be watching. watching such.

The situations created almost never fail to be comic and fun because the characters and interactions are gold. It can be repetitive sometimes, but I think this is expectable from simple stories.Art and sound are perfect in the sense that they are adequate for the genre and have no problems whatsoever. If there is a highlight I think it is the voice acting, it is impressive how they fit the characters' personalities.Overall it is an awesome show, my favorite comedy so far.

"", 'This is the first review I\'ve ever written, but this review is only to explain what I feel about this series and to shortly explain why.Story:*The plot centers arround Jahy, the second ranking ""demon"" from the underworld or dark realm. After the destuction of the great mana crystal, which is the heart of the dark realm, she finds herself stranded in the human world and commits herself to look for every shard of the mana crystal that she can find in order to rebuild her kingdom.*At first, every episode focuses on some little adverture or misadventure in which she finds herself in, due to...several factors that include surviving in a human city, working, being hungry, paying rent. Eventually, the show focuses more on her relationship with her recently found allies. Most situations are solved with comedy and tiny plot twists that go against what Jahy expects, these can be predictable and can make some scenes a bit tiresome but is not an excessive problem (unless you have very little patience).Overall the story can be very enjoyable if you set your expectations under the parameters of a show that sometimes has both child-like humor and aims for a family-friendly concept, or if you are like me, and you really like lighthearted shows, without stress and just being there for the ride.Characters:Jahy is a very likable character because of simple reasons, she isn\'t annoying or utterly stubborn, she learns to see the good in people and eventually shows a heart of herself, the ways in which every character affects her life is unique and in time she manges to see the larger picture of her life with them as something good.I\'m not going to spoil any of the other characters personalities but is enough to say that each complements the show positively, the show actually found restraint to reutilize many jokes that at first you might feel will be overused to death, and instead it tries hard enough and succeeds to an acceptable level to create character development situations. Thus, creating enough growth to move the plot a little bit fordward but greatly improving the relationships Jahy has with everyone, improving the overall enjoyability of the show.Art-Openings-Endings-sound design.Nothing here is exceptional, but enought effort went into each of these parts to make them feel appropiate to the vision of the show and it\'s direction. Both openings and both endings set correct expectations and tone, not overselling but not underselling either. The character design is fun, and not too generic, I personally loved the design of the Landlord, Jahy herself and the last character revealed near the end (NO SPOILERS). Despite early concerns to Jahy\'s outfit I found relief to see that she was never sexualized, nor were the rest of the characters, and I loved that fact. The animation holds up untill the end, so there was no budget drops there, in my opinion the visual experience was very smooth and enjoyable.SUMMARYPROS: Enjoyable characters, good enough character development *for the tone of the series*, never drops quality.CONS: Somewhat predictible puns and jokes and situations (never really improves quality, slightly improves enjoyability).I personally recommend this show to people that might want to rest from heart-pumping shows, or if you want to watch something enjoyable-enough while you lunch, It\'s not great but it\'s worth giving it a chance. I do not recomment this show for people that can\'t stand somewhat flat humor and easy problem solving.Rating: 7.5Thank you for reading.

Unfortunately for her, she can’t do any of those things when she has no power in the human world and is left as a hilarious trash person with the mind of a child who constantly gets herself into trouble by saying or doing something she can’t actually back up. Also because of her lack of mana from the mana crystals her body keeps changing into that of a literal child which doesn’t help with her job or… when she wants to be taken seriously by using threats of murder.It takes a while for her character to develop at first and some viewers might find that irritating as the joke does tend to stale at times, but the show is never overly mean about her predicament. It does help that she is in the hands of two sisters, one her big boobed boss with a nurturing side for Jahy to fall back on whenever she screws up and the other a hot-headed landlord who Jahy refuses to pay rent to even though she can break Jahy with one arm.It doesn’t help that Jahy’s narcissism is fuelled by other characters such as Druj her most loyal and masochistic underling in the dark realm, but is a successful business women in the human world, and Kokoro a little girl Jahy plays with because she is quite literally feeds her ego by calling her Jahy-sama.Silver Link Studios did a great job on the art direction and animation, but the ost is what makes this show work. Like I said at the top of this review, Wii Mii Channel music is just… chefs kiss and the rest of the music is well used to heighten the comedic moments. It’s really fun to listen to.The Great Jahy is very funny. Not the funniest or the best anime comedy I’ve seen, but I had a lot of fun watching it. The characters are charming and there’s a surprising amount of depth to its story. Judging by the show's promotional poster I was worried that there would be a lot of lewding the chibi, but I’m pleased to say that there’s none. There’s very little if any lewding of any of the characters despite how scandalous Jahy’s adult form is so if you’re prudish about ecchi content you can rest easy.7/10 Good. vicious, sadistic narcissist who tends to murder her underlings to keep the other underlings on their toes.

The second-in-command from dark realm (Jahy) has to live along with the humans and find crystals to repair the dark realm and get her powers back.Did I enjoy it?First off gotta say they used rebranded Mii channel music from the Wii for several scenes. I can't tell if I like it or hate it for that. However it was very entertaining. Very lighthearted. Problems that the MC has to put up with through the plot get solved quickly.

Overall the question would be if I enjoyed it? Yes, I do this anime has a very comforting characters and plot and the comedy is hilarious...some may say I have a very bad taste but this anime for me is very underrated and really not that bad. some may say I have a very bad taste but this anime for me is very underrated and really not that bad.', ""Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! is an anime I wanted to enjoy, but It's just a boring slog to get through.

Spoiler:  Nothing happens in this anime.  This is a slice of life anime, about a loli adjusting to human life.  Living on her own, making her own money, and... collecting shards to restore her powers.

After losing her powers her form periodically reverts to that of a child and she must come to terms with working for a meager living wage and accepting the handouts and generosity of others while trying to restore her power.Thematically a slice-of-life comedy, Jahy is a tonal mess of a show and its lead character may be called a gross miscast for the sort of playful karmic retribution...that occurs throughout the anime. The premise of the show is that a cartoonishly evil character must succumb to living a life of borderline poverty in the modern world, but the 'comeuppance' is never severe or equal to how evil she was previously, and the anime goes as far as to show the extent of her decadent lifestyle and sinful actions, such as annihilating her own subordinate over something forgettable and petty.What's more is that this context of characterization is supplied fairly early on in this anime, and so there is an inherent thematic clash with the mostly easy-come-easy-go, goofy, and happy tonality that is maintained throughout the show, as the lead character never experiences a comparable challenge for her life prior to entering the human realm. Instead, the stilted presentation disguises the lead character's villainy as a loli-gyaru to invoke a sense of sympathy and cuteness in her shenanigans, and to perhaps expand the target-demographic to a more niche audience, but this can only be described as tasteless.The animation is fine and then declines to poor by the finale. The writing is fine and sometimes boring; the show is largely episodic, periodically introducing another cast member as it goes on. Many of the characters introduced are low in their dimensionality, making for a predictable and listless experience when they usually appear.I do not recommend this anime.

The theory works along something like this: slice of life genre with medium amount of comedy lightly sprinkled with some deeper ""feel good"" moments. A shapeshifting female main character who can entice both lovers of lolis and admirers of cuter adult women, and whose personality can range from tsundere to moe depending on the situation, ticking of more checkmarks on the viewer-pull list. It is hard to put into words where they failed with their plan, but I\'ll try to reason my scoring anyway.Not sure why it is not really working for me. The MC is...interesting, her character is growing throughout the season, she learns new things and changes accordingly. The two closest supporting characters are also fine, although only one of them grows alongside the main character. The rest of the cast are mostly funny, but I felt like they should have been used as one-offs only, and focus should have been kept on the main trio and their relationship, since the others are far less developed and that unfortunately does not really change by the end of the season (apart from some mandatory anime ""twists"" which are fully foreseeable and not interesting on their own).The main plot was only interesting for a few episodes since new elements to it are not really introduced at all. The show should have been better off almost fully concentrating on the relationships of the main character and the previously mentioned two closest supporting characters, which would have moved it into the direction of the Dragon Maid series\' slice of life feels. It could also have revealed more of the MC\'s past with some flashbacks (something I am very angry at Dragon Maid for not doing more since those were the best episodes in Season 2). I get the feeling the writers were trying to do too much with too much characters and a boring main plot, while the components of a very nice slice of life anime was already in their hands in the beginning.So overall it\'s a letdown for me, but not at all a bad anime. If you need something to go in the background or have nothing to watch in between seasons, go for it. Just don\'t expect anything memorable. interesting, her character is growing throughout the season, she learns new things and changes accordingly.

It's not meant to change the landscape of the medium or anything like that. You're here to watch an occasionally loli demon rough it in a tiny apartment, try to antagonize the people she meets, reminisce of her glory days, and have her superiority complex chipped away. It's simple, slapstick, and an easy watch if you want to just take it easy.Story 6/10It's a basic story. Jahy was once the number two commander of the dark realm and was feared and worshipped by her underlings. The dark realm gets nuked and our story starts with Jahy barely making a...life in the human realm. She lives in a shitty apartment, has a waitress job, and is always short on cash. She's generally a jerk to the people in her life, but they turn out to be pretty nice to her. As we get into the season, Jahy learns to lighten up and to value her friends. It's nice.Characters 9/10I enjoy the characters. They are mostly one-dimensional dimwits but it's fun.Jahy was a big-shot in the dark realm and had to deal with transitioning to a lowly wage worker in the human realm. Her downfall from glory and gradual humbling is fun to watch. She gets taken down a notch with every incident and develops into a better socialized person.I just got through Ep 12 and it was adorable how she acted bossy and ordered her little girl friend around the playground to find her magic stone. But then Jahy got to a slide and imagined gleefully sliding with her friend. Then she got to a rope bridge and imagined wiggling the bridge, shaking her friend, and both of them laughing and having a great time. Then Jahy  picks a flower for her friend to return the favor from last episode. It's wholesome.The other characters are funny too. There's her boss who is nothing but kind to Jahy. She tries to hate her boss but there really is nothing that she can be mad at. There's the landlord who is always chasing Jahy for rent and whom she butts heads with initially. But they get drunk together and confide in each other later in the story. There's Jahy's dark realm underling who loves to be verbally abused but who actually runs a management consulting firm. I'm involved in the business and found it hilarious how she explained the consulting industry cynically and accurately. And then there's the Sailor Moon knockoff magical girl. Jahy hates her and dreams of besting her in battle. There's a part where a panicked child-Jahy threw a water bottle at her and she caught it and crushed it. Jahy was in complete awe at how strong the magical girl was. It killed me.They're all doofuses and the plot is mostly magic nonsense. It's about the slapstick shenanigans.Art 7/10The animation is solid and modern. Everybody looks cute. Jahy is basically Nagatoro with braided hair and permanent cat ears. She transforms from a strappy-bikini-and-boot-clad adult to a giant t-shirt and green crocs-wearing child form. The crocs crack me up. She used to be high and mighty and now wears green crocs. Lol.The other characters have distinct designs. The backgrounds look good. The movements are standard. It's good stuff. Not once did I think that things looked out of place or were substandard.The opening and closing themes have have fun animations. I liked the 2nd closing theme's animation where Jahy is on a giant board game board, rolls the dice, and it always lands on one. It's their way of reinforcing that Jahy is dense but is making progress.Sound 5/10I wasn't feeling the opening and closing themes. The voices were too high-pitched and kiddy. Maybe the VAs were singing in character? Not my thing though.The voices fit everyone and the acting was good. Nothing about the sound stood out good or bad. The sound was decent overall.Enjoyment 10/10I finished 12 episodes and I like it so far. I'm going to continue watching this one all the way through. The story is wholesome, the characters are dumb but well-meaning (for the most part), and Jahy is cute. I still smile when they close up on her green crocs.Overall 9/10This isn't generation-defining anime. It's nice, light-hearted, and wholesome fun. Pretty good stuff.12/25/21 Update:Just finished ep 20/20. It's too wholesome. I had a big grin on my face the entire episode. Loved it.I have to raise my score on this because I had a such a good time. It's Christmas and this show, ep 20 in particular, is holiday material. life in the human realm.

Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! is an anime about a weird demon-girl-thing that is trying to gather shards... no they don\'t really focus on that after like five episodes. Um okay... Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! follows a demon that loses her dark-realm home and ends up in our world with no other option than to get a job... wait isn\'t this the plot for a different anime?Okay, so I\'m not entirely sure what to tell you since the story isn\'t much and loses focus. Basically, you\'ve got this dark-skinned...demon who is apparently the demon lord\'s second in command. The crystal of dark power (or whatever it\'s called) that basically renders their entire world into existence is destroyed and our scantily-clad, smug AF, demon girl winds up in the human world... as a (legal?) loli. You\'ll follow her many... many... MANY misadventures as she tries to find shards of the dark crystal to regain her home, her dark lord, and her clout. Things begin to change though, (as the creators decided they need to prolong this story somehow) as our little protagonist learns that it isn\'t so bad being in the human realm and making friendships and eating food and doing fun things and *insert cute thing here*...!So the story is nothing to behold in my opinion. It feels like a bunch of filler episodes trying to make up a bigger story but that is probably the point of the show. It was pretty funny and that\'s about all that made up for it. I could simply describe the plot as a ""Life Sucks Simulator"" but that\'s what made it funny to me. The over-the-top comedy was nothing new, but I still found myself laughing (maybe because a college student can relate to not eating lol... please help me....). I think this is just one of those shows you gotta go into with no high expectations, no brain cells, and just don\'t analyze anything. Enjoy it for what it is and move along with your day lol.The characters, of course, have their quirks and unique or funny personalities. You will probably notice the same personalities in these characters as some other comedy characters you\'ve watched before (basically there is nothing to behold about the characters either). Again, they are all funny and it makes up for it being cliché, but something you can appreciate is that it was done well. There was no character that I loathed because they were all pretty enjoyable. Nothing ruins a comedy like an annoying protagonist, antagonist, or recurring supporting characters in my opinion, and I didn\'t see that in this one. Each individual\'s interactions with our little demon were pretty funny, and the most entertaining ones were her fights with her landlord.Overall, would I recommend this to my friends or any other otaku for that matter? Probably not. There are so many other animes out there that are even more enjoyable or even more entertaining, that I would only recommend watching this if you have literally nothing better to watch. That, or if you just want a chill, zero-mental-effort show to watch, go ahead.So, if you are bored and like simple, funny characters, plus there is no better anime to watch...

It is not very exciting, or creative, or well characterized. but it\'s good for a chuckle or two and passes half an hour inoffensively.

But it\'ll join a whole host of barely-descript shows in the dustbin of anime history.The animation...isn\'t great, serviceable, but bland and stiff. The music is odd, with lots of nods to more famous music but in downgraded form. The OP and ED are pretty rough, the ED in particular which is astonishingly bad. I don\'t get the hate for the hololive Vtubers who performed it though, it\'s the production and composition that suck, not the singing, per se.Anyway, for a shounen CGDCT show it\'s not terrible, but way behind something like Gabriel Dropout, for example.

This show is a perfect show to turn your brain off, no need to think, inject a giant overarching plot, it's sit down shut up and watch.

I will be the first to admit, the first few episodes I had to kinda force myself through. The characters come off as very cookie cutter, and honestly kind of annoying at firstThat being said, this show defiantly finds its stride as it progresses. Characters become more likeable, and in all honesty the show just gets better as it goes along.Is it a perfect show? No not by any means, but it does pick up after after around episode 4-6.Now I find my self getting excited for each new episode.The animation is fine, nothing too crazy, but certainly not...bad. The story is where this anime seems to find some pacing problems. Looking at this series of 20 episodes, this number probably could have been cut down a bit and certainly stumbles until it finds its stride.The sound is fine, again nothing out of this world, but not terrible. The characters especially Jahy can be a hard sell the first few episodes, but as previously mentioned find fall into place as we learn more about them.I do really like the character design, the main character does have an interesting dynamic being able to morph from a child to an adult and comes with the different iterations of that.All and all it is a fun show to watch and is overall enjoyable. I find my self getting excited as new episodes air.Overall Score: Good 7/10 bad. The story is where this anime seems to find some pacing problems.

Create an engaging comedy with a theme of demons, magical beings, and magical girls.What exactly makes Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! good? It all really boils down to characterization through light-hearted comedy. Sometimes, that's enough. I honestly think that Jahy has a much more in-depth character profile than protagonists in random shounen shows, like Shin in 86, purely due to the fact that I actually get to witness Jahy through a lot of different scenarios and go through a wide spectrum of emotions, while someone like Shin barely even talks, let alone...makes me feel a connection with the character.Due to her demonic powers being taken away from her, Jahy is not only powerless, but also undergoes a personality change, from a overbearing, heartless demon to a more childish form and disposition to boot. This transitioning period, this time where Jahy has to adapt to her circumstances is endearing. Sometimes, the situations she suffers definitely makes me feel more pity than some boring protagonists. Why is that? Because again, someone like Shin, and honestly, a lot of characters nowadays just make the viewer understand them through flashbacks rather than genuine interactions. Rather than shove a tragic backstory about a random character I don't care about, I find Jahy struggling to climb a damn tree to be a lot more interesting to watch, and a lot more sad. I know, right? I find Jahy crying in heartbreak over her hard-earned demon stone being stolen a lot more sentimental than a random character's flashback where his loved one gets killed or tortured and whatever.When Jahy goes through hardship, I start rooting for her, and that's when you know you've created a character that can be invested in. And in turn, her enjoying the mundane becomes something endearing to watch, something satisfying. You also get to slowly see how Jahy transforms her personality, sometimes out of necessity, and sometimes because of how people close to her treat her and talk to her.Of course, something equally as impressive is the rest of the characters. Most of the comedies that I've watched or read have annoying characters: even Gintama has Sarutobi, who has an insufferably shallow range of available actions that she can ever do, since her character never develops, and she never really goes past her archetype. I don't really have that problem with Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai!'s characters, and I think that has to do with the fact that their relationships to Jahy are so different that it's never a boring experience to have them interact with Jahy.The shop owner and her sister have important roles to play in the story, and they also don't bind themselves to simple roles, but rather are able to freely interact with Jahy. They start off with simple things, like fighting to complete rent, or the big sister acting as an emotional oasis, and while that never fades away, you can clearly tell that their beginning interactions eventually progresses to a much more fun outlet of imagination in terms of the ways they're able to engage with Jahy.Druj, a typical archetype, honestly becomes quite fun to watch when paired with Jahy's humor and monologuing together with her. The worshipping-type character's person of interest usually does not hold them in high regard, and they also don't care about at all, finding them to be annoying. While that was the case in Hell, where Jahy had status, now that her power is gone, and her personality changed, she always is desperate to keep her image up with Druj, making her a fun experience.What about Jinguu? Again, another worshipping-type character, but the opposite of Druj, where Jahy really doesn't need to keep her image up with Jinguu, since she's familiar with Jahy's Earth personality, rather than her Hell one, and makes  a fine contrast to Druj, and of course, a sense of rivalry. At the same time, the fact that Jahy is held in high regard whilst also again, doing stuff like have playing on the slides and competing seriously with kids is a great canvas for all sorts of scenarios and gags.Kokoro highlights Jahy's childish nature, and that's not really a bad thing. She's Jahy's friend that provides a sharp contrast to the too clingy Jinguu, or the childish innocence that Druj lacks.Salwa, honestly, I'm definitely biased here, but I just like these types of characters. I always find it quite fun to watch her try to scheme against Jahy, but not only that, but also through her schemes, get to see more of her personality come to life and her interactions with characters close to Jahy.Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! is able to create a fun setting and canvas for a lot of fun scenarios, and sometimes serious ones too. Different characters create different tones with Jahy, and the way they interact with each other and Jahy never gets bored, since so many different scenarios and gags can be explored with how the world is built and how characters' personalities are. makes me feel a connection with the character.Due to her demonic powers being taken away from her, Jahy is not only powerless, but also undergoes a personality change, from a overbearing, heartless demon to a more childish form and disposition to boot.

The action scenes, despite not being many, are well animated and the expressions are on point, something that for a show that relies on its characters...and comedy is really important.The plot is non-existent but that’s alright since it is an episode-by-episode kind of show, where every story and adventure begins and ends in the 20 minutes timeframe.

However, there were some noticeable production issues. This being made by Silver Link might be why, but SL shouldn't be the one getting all the bad rap.Visuals were nice, however in the later episodes, it seemed that the digital cels for foreground objects and characters had a bit of a noticeable line around them (and not in a good way), which made it look like they were superimposed onto the screen in a cheap-er fashion than earlier in the show.Sound and music were pretty good, no qualms there.Story is average.The anime had those moments where you really want a character to...do something and then they go in another direction, so that gives it some bonus points.

Yes, it is a feel-good show but then it is also kind of boring at times.The art is a nice style that suits really well. I loved the dog.The sound is borderline average and the OP and ED don't excite me at all.The characters although not inherently bad are pretty dull, I honestly found Jahy to be a pretty boring...character in the end if I am honest.I find overall the show is fun in its own way but is about as average as average can be. 5/10. character in the end if I am honest.I find overall the show is fun in its own way but is about as average as average can be. 5/10."", ""Ah yeah, this is that dopamine rush I live for. This is why I watch anime. Jahy-sama is simply pure fun to watch.Honestly reverse isekai where fantasies characters get sent to the real world aren't even that unique anymore. That genre is so bled dry that every combination of settings has been done. Despite tons of comparisons I could make to other shows I felt this one stood above the rest in it's completely brutal treatment of our main character. You take a girl with an insanely prideful personality and put her in the most unfortunate situation possible and there's bound to be laughs. Not...to mention just how adorable she is when she's mad.Watching Jahy constantly fail would be disheartening if she reacted the way some characters do when bullied by the universe. But the title of the show says it all, she will never give up her pride no matter how bad things get for her. You end up cheering her on even as you laugh at her misfortune. As the series progresses and Jahy slowly gains some of her former life back they're constantly throwing more and more bad news her way. Even when she thinks she's done something good it ends up being a major blow to her pride somehow. In the end it turns out the events of the show as a whole were all set in motion by a dumb misunderstanding.It's got great comedy, a cast of colorful characters and plenty of heartwarming moments sprinkled in to lighten the mood when it starts getting a little too much.

I enjoyed watching it but it is not a show to write home about.Story: 7The story is mostly just a set up to get the characters in comedic situations and only for that purpose you will especially notice that when you get to the end of the show, not that it is a bad thing. Jahy becomes more open and more kind while everyone else usually sticks to their given character trope and does not deviate.Art:...8   Sound: 7The art is very good especially since silver link was animating it and did a very good job with the animation. The funny faces and expressions that would be made were also well animated as expected though nothing very notable besides that. The art style overall was very cute.As for sound the music was fitting for the scenes they used it in though I can not think of anything notable. That second intro is obnoxious but I love it for that reason so that's something. If you count voice acting as part of the sound I would say the voice acting was great and fit all of the characters but nothing remarkable.Enjoyment and Overall: 7For overall enjoyment I enjoyed watching it and gave me an anime to look forward to every saturday though like I said nothing particularly outstanding about it. Jahy-sama is just a good show to watch just for the sake of it though I imagine the 20 episodes instead of the average 12 or 13 will scare some people off but if you stick around and watch it all you will not feel like you waisted your time or anything. 8   Sound: 7The art is very good especially since silver link was animating it and did a very good job with the animation.

The...STORY (7) motto we got here for this style of laid back and wholesome anime is k-i-s-s, keep it simple, stupid, and it does this in a good way and its paced well.

The ART (10) couldn\'t really be better for what its trying to do. It is vibrant and rounded and full of facial and body expressions animated toward the show\'s tonal goal, which is a jubilant comedy, you know, despite living in poverty lol.

The OP/ED\'s range from not bad to outta the park home run, at least in my opinion. The soundtrack\'s great, quite cutesy or fun - it\'s used well. The voice acting it top notch  and all fitting to their character. And the CHARACTER (9) cast is pretty perfect for the goal of the show, designs are all either really good or nothing to complain about. Jahy is pretty hard to not love, quite the little brat who\'s cunning is actually pretty non existent. The rest fill in around Jahy very nicely, good chemistry, good eccentrics.The show provided me with ample ENJOYMENT (10), highly reccomended, I tell you what. It definitely accomplished what it set out to do, everything was made with intent. It embraces the tropes it uses and they come off well from what I recall. Unless you\'re offended by tropes from this genre there should be no issue since they do them, well, inoffensively.

The soundtrack was really great. I couldn't remember the time when I really fell in love with an anime, thanks to its music. The nostalgia will remains very strong with this one.

That one has a gorgeous look (its from Kyoto Animation), delightful characters that grow, complex subtle emotions and adorable mundane daily life adventures.As for Jahy, the faults are apparent but if this is your type of show, its ok.Cons:Jahy's animation is noticeably sub-par; from poorly drawn frames, re-used character cells making up the majority of the show, and nothing that takes advantage of the medium. Basically, its like watching a motion-comic that...barely has any movement.The characters are flat. Some are meant to annoy the main character but end up being annoying to watch as well. You see everything the show has to offer in a few episodes and then it just repeats itself.Pros:The lead character, Jahy, has an amazing voice actor (Japanese).The next best thing is that its focused on the comedy. Despite Adult-Jahy wearing the skimpiest outfit in all anime, the camera doesn't focus on her body in typical slow-fanservice fashion. It feels like the animators don't have a single sexual bone in their bodies and that's refreshing. This is extra great because the character is in a child-form for most of the show and there is no loli-fanservice at all.Neutral:The humor comes from failure. Jahy (and a few other recurring characters) are incompetent, selfish, and childish; they fail at their ambitions and are humiliated in the process. Personally, I like when the characters get embarrassed over something, but the show is more focused on slapstick.I was looking forward to this without any expectations, and honestly, its fine.

It was given a very generous 20 episodes and with that it delivered extremely bland uninteresting characters, and a simply insulting main plot that should've just been scrapped. To enjoy this you either convince yourself that it's ok since jahy is a several hundred year old demon, or you are a literal slice of life goblin and can happily watch nothing but cute loli for 20 episodes.The characters are undoubtedly supposed to be the main part in the show, and most of them are horribly written. Aside...from the green haired girl who is somewhat interesting, Every character can be placed into 2 groups, A child or a stoic adult. Jahy herself is this emotionally crippled child, who cannot resist mentioning every 2 seconds how much she missed abusing her subordinates in a position of unwavering power, only to cry over getting tripped up by her shoelaces 2 seconds later. The weird infantilization of Jahy continues on throughout the show and just gets downright cringe to watch later on. There is basically no character progression also, except people treating jahy like a queen when she treats them like shit, then realizes every once in while that she shouldn't be an asshole.The other type of character is the stoic ones, and they're more bland than anything else. Later into the show we get introduced to jahy's 5 year old friend, and for some reason she exhibits the same emotional maturity as an 80 year old sage. She ends up as a another babysitter for this 'adult' demon, as is the fate with every stoic character, and just repeats the same trope every single meeting. It just feels creepy and cringe watching this dynamic and drags the show down even more.The crowning achievement of this show, referencing the back end of course, is the literal trash attempt at a story. Summing it up as easily as i can, 2 sisters, one leaves and creates the demon realm because ???, other gets jealous and bestows power to a human to interfere in the demon realm because she's shy??, human is too powerful and destroys demon realm, magic crystals that make up demon realm hurt humans, ohshit.exe. Later on they reunite and after fighting because ??? they get introduced to the cast as 2 loli twins, because there wasn't enough boring jailbait in this show. I see no reality where anyone can objectively look at the story and give it anything more than a 2/10. Terrible idea and terrible execution.Overall I would not recommend Jahy-Sama unless as previously stated you're a slice of life goblin or you're scoping out a potential court case.

Jahy gets reversed iseakied into the modern day Japan. While this is a good setup for a fish out of water story, some jokes are repetitive or recycled. The show does manage to be fairly predictable as well. Jahy gets into a bad situtation and is down on her luck, rinse and repeat until end of series. The series was longer than it needed to be, all the good parts can be condensed into a 12 or so episode series. The comedy does manage to hit it out of the park...sometimes. I do find Saurva's quest to get revnge to be the funniest part as Jahy does not or barely manages to even acknowledge her. One character is doing everything in their power and the other is not even aware.ArtThe show does have nice aniamtion, but the art style can be lacking in some areas.SoundNot much to say about the music, nothing bad really.CharacterThe cast other than Jahy is very one note. We have the nice manager, the mean landlord, the antagonistic Magical girl, the loyal servant, the idiot pursuer, and the naive kid. Jahy does manage to play off well with the others and is the anchor that holds this show together. It does also get a tad boring watching Jahy down on ther luck failing time and time again.EnjoymentThis series has a decent premise and Jahy is a good character that holds the series together. it does manage to be funny sometimes and very repetitive at other times.

This is a show that is driven by its cast of wacky characters who all have their various quirks that makes them both funny and endearing.For example, we have the great Jahy who attempts to carry a veneer of class and authority but is actually a terribly insecure girl that is afraid of being shown up and is not beyond lying (terribly I may add) to hide her glaring shortcomings. Naturally she falls into numerous predicaments where her flaws are...painfully exposed and the stuff she gets up to in digging herself out the hole are funny to watch. Whilst the comedy is not sophisticated by any means (it is rather childish actually) I never got bored with these comedy moments. She is essentially the driving force to this series so if you like Jahy then you will like the show and with her having a rather simple and predictable personality it won’t take long before you work out whether you like her or not.This is not to say she is the only funny character as the rest of the cast also has their moments. The other big characters are Jahy’s landlady and boss who both have their moments of comedy (and madness) also. Both these girls naturally take a liking to Jahy but the calm and happy demeanour of her boss means she often acts as the voice of reason (there is not much reasoning amongst this cast) while her landlady is more impulsive and temper driven. With Jahy’s pride and her superiority complex against humans she naturally comes to blows with her landlord who is not much different to her in temperament.Beyond this main cast the supporting cast is also strong and it is likely you will take to one (or more). If I am honest a lot of them are pretty insane in their own ways with more than one character exhibiting some masochistic tendencies. It is not just their personalities that are likeable but the relationships they form with Jahy or other characters that often leads to some very amusing and wholesome moments. This is especially so in the later parts of the show when the entire cast is assembled.This series does not hit the mark all the time though and I must say the number one demon was rather underwhelming. The jokes and gags that centred around this character was not very funny to begin with and it quickly got repetitive. Fortunately, they were not a main character so it was no biggie and by that point of the anime there are other players who can cover up this shortcoming. Speaking of shortcomings don’t expect to see a whole load of character development and growth in this show outside of Jahy is limited. This lack of growth does mean that there is a chance you may grow weary from some of the gags told in this series as the personalities don’t change only the scenarios.Speaking of scenarios, in terms of plot this basically covers the daily problems of Jahy and her quest to bring back the dark realm. In many ways it runs like a slice-of-life show albeit one that doesn’t take itself too seriously. It is a story that is told at a relatively pedestrian pace so if you expect quick plot developments then you will be disappointed. It isn’t the main purpose of the show though and with the amount of comedy and crazy moments this show throws at you it is a point that is easily overlooked.In terms of ending, things are wrapped up fairly tight and in the midst of some rather absurd scenes we do get a final explanation as to what happened in the early moments of this anime. This explanation also gave us a nice insight into the mentality of certain characters giving us a good idea on why some of the early craziness came about. It is not earthshattering so don’t expect greatness here but I did think it ended well enough and more importantly, at the right moment as going further with this anime’s setup would have meant the shows antics would have gotten old.Animation/music:Animation is fairly solid but never outstanding. There are scenes when the animation quality takes a dip and those lapses increase in frequency as the series progresses with moments when the character modelling look almost as wonky as the character’s personality! It is never bad though and with this being a simple comedy show it is never the main focus of the anime.The animation in the opening and ending sequences are stronger and all of them, with their striking colouring schemes, are delightful to watch. Music wise there is greater variation in quality and I felt the first OP/ED pair was better than the second set. I particularly liked the first opening beat ""Fightin★Pose"" by Yui Ogura which was a great way to kick off episodes. Both ending themes were good with the first ""Tsumari wa Itsumo Kujikenai!"" by NEGI☆U edging it although I did still like ""Pedals"" by Miho Okasaki. The second opening ""Seikatsu Konkyuu Dame Dinero"" by Sumire Uesaka was the weakest of the lot.Summary:If you want a series where you can switch your brain off and just enjoy the ride then Jahy is certainly a show that can fit that bill. Don’t expect any sophistication or depth in this series as it is a simple comedy with characters that are off the wall. If you want some deeper (even on a comedy level) then best to look elsewhere as you won’t get that here.Whilst the story is slow of the mark and can often meander along getting distracted with silly antics that occur on a very frequent basis this can easily be overlooked by the fact the cast from The Great Jahy are all very likeable in their own ways. What is more, as the series progresses things generally gets better as the cast expands and the interactions widens meaning jokes get less repetitive as there is more variety.If you like cute girls and wholesome moments then you will particularly like this anime as for all Jahy’s swagger, on a fundamental level she is a kind sweet girl. This innocent nature is not just limited to Jahy however as there are several “villains” with some very redeeming qualities and that’s before we even consider Jahy’s “underling”. In the end I would recommend this anime if you like your characters to be a little crazy and are looking for something to unwind or settle down after watching some heavy or dark anime series.Story 7 – In terms of overall story it won’t win awards but the important thing is the various scenarios and antics Jahy and her gang find themselves in. More often than not these set-pieces work. What was also nice is the fact most of these good moments don’t rely on the standard slice-of-life tropes. It meanders but there is progression and things do wrap up nicely and at an appropriate time.Characters 8 – Biggest strength of the show. Key element in enjoying the series with the anchor being Jahy herself. If you like Jahy then you will like the show it is that simple. Watch an episode or two, if need be, to decide. The other characters are generally very solid with only one weak character in the entire cast.Animation 7 – Good for the most part but there are a number of moments when things do go south. This only increases in frequency as the series progresses. Fortunately, the opening and ending sequences are of a higher standard and the musical score is strong also. The music used in the episodes were also notable in generating the appropriate moods.Overall 7.5 – The Great Jahy will not gain universal appeal and its simple characters and storyline means this will not be for people who want more substance from their anime. If you don’t care about mindless thrills then this will be a series that will be appealing to you. Most of the girls in this series are pretty crazy and dumb plus the chemistry they have make this a comedy that hits the mark on a consistent basis.

Joker Game,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31405/Joker_Game,"['Cool gadgets. Fine women. Exotic locations. Fast cars. Espionage. Epic Adventures.This idealized depiction of the spy lifestyle has always been an in-house staple in Tinseltown, with big IPs like James Bond and The Mission Impossible franchise selling this image to rake in a cool profit with each new installment. While the actual lifestyle itself might not be any more glamorous than what\'s presented in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" or ""Spy Game,"" it\'s still fun to see these lavish illustrations as they play out. The truth of the matter is that most real-life spy work revolves around arduous, long-term cover jobs, methodical information gathering, counterintelligence,...espionage and very rarely, the occasional physical altercation. But that template wouldn\'t make for an entertaining movie now, would it? Or at least not for Hollywood bigwigs looking to make a big splash at the box office.But unlike the calculated risk of a big-budget Hollywood production, this is the world of anime, where the niche has a place to flourish and a built-in audience willing to give it a chance. Regardless of the actual end result, even the most tamed of anime offerings could be ""different"" by the standards of mainstream media. So with that in mind, how does a show like Joker Game approach this subject matter? Is it an adrenaline rush like ""The Bourne Identity"" and other spy thrillers, or is it relentlessly honest like ""The Imitation Game"" and titles that choose to take a more precise route in the depiction of spy work? Well, I\'m not quite sure, and I don\'t think the show has an answer to that inquiry either. Why you may ask? Well, let\'s find out together.Set during the WWII era, the story follows several Japanese spies as their day-to-day endeavors are recollected in a memoir-like narrative structure. Through the course of the show, we\'re made privy to a vast variety of methods that they utilize in order to carry out their services for their country. Decoding enemy tactics and spreading false information was all par for the course for our agents. The show forwarned that all of its events and names depicted were fictional, but it\'s fair to surmise that some of what was shown was inspired by historical occurrences. The degree to which those aspects were exaggerated varied immensely, but we\'ll address that later.Transporting us to a time that\'s rarely delved into in the medium while simultaneously eliminating elements that have become almost symbiotic with anime, it doesn\'t take much to see the initial appeal that Joker Game brought to the table. For the most part, the title exudes a feeling of self-restraint in its actions. Characters were drawn with anatomical precision, locations were well mapped out, color choices were reasonably muted for the period-piece it was set in; everything functioned with a sense of real-world cinematics. A production invested in decisions that were devoid of most contemporary tricks, pulling far more from the world of live-action movies than it did the medium it resided in. This anime was the Dos Equis guy, suave and intellectual, not the boisterous Bud Light Frat boys.So it\'s smooth, takes itself seriously, draws from real-world occurrences, and appears perceptive... so what\'s the problem? Well, its very nature is.When a show like Joker Game takes itself seriously and demands a baseline level of respect from its audience, it\'s usually granted with a few unspoken rules that are easy to comprehend when spotlighted. The more serious you take yourself and subject matter, the less room for error you\'re given, as the audience will treat what\'s being seen with the same amount of scrutiny as the title has self-imposed on itself. In other words, the more realistic you try to be, the more realistic you\'re expected to be.If this was a lighthearted comedy, the ability to ""let loose"" is far more obtainable since comedies are inherently silly by nature. However, in the case of a serious spy thriller, a sudden shift in tone can cause unwarranted whiplash. No one will call foul if Zoolander breaks out in a dance number, but if the same is done in There Will Be Blood, you might as well return the Oscar. And it\'s this very conundrum that Joker Game finds itself in, because while it may appear to be the Dos Equis\'s ""Most Interesting Man in the World,"" it often spills its liquor like the klutzy Bud Light frat boys it so desperately tries to avoid being.Due to the mostly episodic story structure, there\'s no true connective tissue holding anything together. As stand-alone episodes, they all bring varying degrees of engagement, but never anything to get invested into since there are no characters with definitive traits or overarching storylines to get immersed in. We\'re constantly introduced to a different mission and spy, or at least that\'s how it appears given the similar appearance of all the people involved. The only reoccurring character is that of Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki, the founder and head command of D Agency: the spy agency based off Japan that our spies report to. And even with his status as the only recurring character shown, the only intriguing thing divulged from his involvement is his backstory, which we don\'t get until the tail-end of the series. A backstory that, mind you, doesn\'t change how we view him, as he still remains an enigma. The main reason for why one was given to him, in the first place, was to showcase the type of temperament needed to become a spy—which by itself makes for a great thesis statement for the show as a whole—but as a means of endearing him to the audience, it offers nothing at all.Joker Game is just too impersonal, an anime that\'s more concerned with maintaining a rigid appearance than it does revealing any blemishes found with its human participants. And it\'s this very stiff impersonal approach that not only alienates it from viewers but also leaves very little leeway for mistakes to be swept under the rug. If you can\'t empathize with anything in a supposedly ""realistic"" story, expecting it to be met with forgiveness from the audience when it messes up is simply wishful thinking. And so, watching Joker Game became akin to watching a theater play from the mezzanine seating, entertaining but too distant from viewers to allow an intimate connection.So keeping that in mind, this anime functions like a loose anthology, to which its success is forced to be judged on an episode by episode basis. This may not seem like an unreasonable request at first, given how many episodic series has successfully navigated its way through similar setups, but that\'s before you account for the constraints that the show has placed on itself. For 12 episodes, Joker Game is expected to operate like a realistic spy thriller, unfortunately for it, that\'s a commitment it very seldom made in just 1, let alone 12.With each new spy and mission introduced, a new opportunity to fumble presents itself. And sadly, that\'s what happens as these episodes are split down the middle in terms of practicality. Like the varying level of engagement that each could bring, the level of plausibility also ranges as well. The fact that they\'re spies is often used to excuse away far-fetched solutions, which, at times, could be convincing given the skill set taught to these men, but when the ruse is painfully obvious, there\'s very little that could be done to course correct the issue. To give a spoiler-free evaluation, there would be solutions taken that was plausible, only for the following episode to exercise acts akin to Pink Panther excerpts. Suspension of disbelief could only get you so far, especially when dealing with a show that\'s desperately signaling that it has the know-how to pull it off while presenting leaps of logic that no amount of mental gymnastics is capable of excusing. You can\'t expect viewers to take something seriously while the content itself becomes farcical in nature. There comes a point where calling out bullshit is the only affirmative action left to take, and for Joker Game, that time arose far too often.For every instance that Joker Game is able to convince its audience, there are isolated scenarios that could be seen as satirical when viewed out of context. And again, had this been a show that wasn\'t so uptight about everything, this wouldn\'t be a jarring issue. But when you aim for realism and only half-deliver on that promise, there are very little passes that could be given to excuse the inconsistency. There\'s no levity, no quirkiness, no moment to unwind. Joker Game is simply too ""adult"" for that, and it doesn\'t always work out in its favor, especially when it\'s making a fool of itself.It could be said that a great deal of the title\'s authenticity came from its dedication towards upholding this disciplined portrayal. It certainly was the reason that I enjoyed it, regardless of the cartoonish moments. The blood-curdling sounds of a violin paired up with the interlaced beating of drums, as the bellowing timbre of an incoming choir ascends over the musical arrangements. The way the camera would follow one of our agents, gliding along as if docked on a dolly track, the entire scene letterboxed for added visual flair. Natural dialogue exchanges that avoided most of the zany back-and-forth that anime usually fall back on, choosing to use more realistic banter to help sell the scene. It\'s these aspects that sustained Joker Game when its screenplay was in danger of derailment. This may have resulted in many viewing it as ""boring,"" given the grounded nature of everything, but when accounting for the subject matter in question, it was the right call to make. Had the show broken character, it would have caused more tonal whiplash than it would have helped. The result of which could be seen in the 4th episode\'s juvenile escalation from its relatively adult depiction to grossly overblown melodrama that it regressed into. This isn\'t a show that has the leg-room to indulge in anime-like commonalities. It\'s one of the least ""anime"" anime to have aired in 2016.The only way Joker Game could have walked out of this situation unscathed was if the writing was as airtight as the presentation. And sadly, this wasn\'t the case.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite the issues plaguing it, each scenario never loses focus. Joker Game\'s headstrong commitment may have hurt it in the end, but it also serves as the reason why I enjoyed it. I loved seeing a more hard-edged, realistic depiction of spy-life. I loved the color palette and air of mystique. And when the show wasn\'t tripping over itself, I loved the tension it was able to capture in certain moments. Joker Game was fun, dumb at times, but still fun nonetheless.Overall: 6/10Despite how commonplace spy-related media is in movies and novels, it\'s still a relatively obscure topic in the world of anime. What Joker Game had to offer may not have been as extensive as the subject matter would entail, but it did leave a distinct enough mark for me to want more. Its downfall was its pigheaded commitment to always being serious, regardless of how silly some of its solutions ended up being. Even with this in mind, I still think Joker Game was entertaining enough to warrant giving it a try. It had something to offer that very few in the medium have attempted to service. It adds to a landscape that\'s known for its diversity, and that\'s always a good thing in my book. espionage and very rarely, the occasional physical altercation. But that template wouldn\'t make for an entertaining movie now, would it? Or at least not for Hollywood bigwigs looking to make a big splash at the box office.But unlike the calculated risk of a big-budget Hollywood production, this is the world of anime, where the niche has a place to flourish and a built-in audience willing to give it a chance. Regardless of the actual end result, even the most tamed of anime offerings could be ""different"" by the standards of mainstream media. So with that in mind, how does a show like Joker Game approach this subject matter? Is it an adrenaline rush like ""The Bourne Identity"" and other spy thrillers, or is it relentlessly honest like ""The Imitation Game"" and titles that choose to take a more precise route in the depiction of spy work? Well, I\'m not quite sure, and I don\'t think the show has an answer to that inquiry either. Why you may ask? Well, let\'s find out together.Set during the WWII era, the story follows several Japanese spies as their day-to-day endeavors are recollected in a memoir-like narrative structure. Through the course of the show, we\'re made privy to a vast variety of methods that they utilize in order to carry out their services for their country. Decoding enemy tactics and spreading false information was all par for the course for our agents. The show forwarned that all of its events and names depicted were fictional, but it\'s fair to surmise that some of what was shown was inspired by historical occurrences. The degree to which those aspects were exaggerated varied immensely, but we\'ll address that later.Transporting us to a time that\'s rarely delved into in the medium while simultaneously eliminating elements that have become almost symbiotic with anime, it doesn\'t take much to see the initial appeal that Joker Game brought to the table. For the most part, the title exudes a feeling of self-restraint in its actions. Characters were drawn with anatomical precision, locations were well mapped out, color choices were reasonably muted for the period-piece it was set in; everything functioned with a sense of real-world cinematics. A production invested in decisions that were devoid of most contemporary tricks, pulling far more from the world of live-action movies than it did the medium it resided in. This anime was the Dos Equis guy, suave and intellectual, not the boisterous Bud Light Frat boys.So it\'s smooth, takes itself seriously, draws from real-world occurrences, and appears perceptive... so what\'s the problem? Well, its very nature is.When a show like Joker Game takes itself seriously and demands a baseline level of respect from its audience, it\'s usually granted with a few unspoken rules that are easy to comprehend when spotlighted. The more serious you take yourself and subject matter, the less room for error you\'re given, as the audience will treat what\'s being seen with the same amount of scrutiny as the title has self-imposed on itself. In other words, the more realistic you try to be, the more realistic you\'re expected to be.If this was a lighthearted comedy, the ability to ""let loose"" is far more obtainable since comedies are inherently silly by nature. However, in the case of a serious spy thriller, a sudden shift in tone can cause unwarranted whiplash. No one will call foul if Zoolander breaks out in a dance number, but if the same is done in There Will Be Blood, you might as well return the Oscar. And it\'s this very conundrum that Joker Game finds itself in, because while it may appear to be the Dos Equis\'s ""Most Interesting Man in the World,"" it often spills its liquor like the klutzy Bud Light frat boys it so desperately tries to avoid being.Due to the mostly episodic story structure, there\'s no true connective tissue holding anything together. As stand-alone episodes, they all bring varying degrees of engagement, but never anything to get invested into since there are no characters with definitive traits or overarching storylines to get immersed in. We\'re constantly introduced to a different mission and spy, or at least that\'s how it appears given the similar appearance of all the people involved. The only reoccurring character is that of Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki, the founder and head command of D Agency: the spy agency based off Japan that our spies report to. And even with his status as the only recurring character shown, the only intriguing thing divulged from his involvement is his backstory, which we don\'t get until the tail-end of the series. A backstory that, mind you, doesn\'t change how we view him, as he still remains an enigma. The main reason for why one was given to him, in the first place, was to showcase the type of temperament needed to become a spy—which by itself makes for a great thesis statement for the show as a whole—but as a means of endearing him to the audience, it offers nothing at all.Joker Game is just too impersonal, an anime that\'s more concerned with maintaining a rigid appearance than it does revealing any blemishes found with its human participants. And it\'s this very stiff impersonal approach that not only alienates it from viewers but also leaves very little leeway for mistakes to be swept under the rug. If you can\'t empathize with anything in a supposedly ""realistic"" story, expecting it to be met with forgiveness from the audience when it messes up is simply wishful thinking. And so, watching Joker Game became akin to watching a theater play from the mezzanine seating, entertaining but too distant from viewers to allow an intimate connection.So keeping that in mind, this anime functions like a loose anthology, to which its success is forced to be judged on an episode by episode basis.

One it aired on Tuesday, a day where only two titles were airing, two I got it mixed up with another title airing this season with the word ""joker"" in it. Now when I first started Joker Game I honestly didn\'t expect much from it. It wasn\'t until later episodes that it really started to take off and I started to enjoy it immensely.\'Story 8.5/10Really interesting plot and story going on for each episode. In my opinion I think that the greatest thing about the story is that it remains, no matter what the episode...or plot is about, dramatic. Like, I found it very difficult to turn away from Joker Game. Whenever I tried to do something else while I was watching it, something interesting would happen and I\'d be like ""Oh man! what\'s going to happen next."" So to me I\'d say that drama is the shows main focal point. One  other thing that I admire was how even though the story wasn\'t based on real events, the episodes and narrative played out like a old re-enactment of history videos you\'d see on discovery channel or national geographic. The story added so much realism despite it being completely fictional and that is something that stood out to me quite a lot! Often times the dialogue seemed overly dramatic however this doesn\'t change my overall feelings for the story. The plot for each episode always kept things interesting & exciting because of the mystery element added to it.  Honestly, I couldn\'t find too much that I didn\'t like in the story department other than the ending, which I cannot spoil because rules. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed watching the story of joker game unfold.Visually, I was impressed with the background settings in Joker game. the details to certain objects and vehicles like the trains, cars, and other items looked alright. It was as if the team working on the shows animations for 1950\'s style settings did a good job with accurately researching objects, devices and settings from the 1950\'s. Although I\'m sure most of their research focused more on main stream objects like guns, best trains available,  best cars for that time period, that sort of thing. Character designs were pretty good however, I didn\'t like how plain a majority of the males looked. I\'m glad that the females stood out more than the males but I  still think the character designers could have done a better job with the appearances of the characters.Let me start off with my favorite thing in the soundtrack department, the voice actors, seiyuu\'s etc.. they did a great job with speaking English! Words were pronounced fluently (to a certain extent) and properly spoken in their sentences. It really shows the devotion and extent that actors are willing to go to star in a role. Having that experiences really helps with getting more roles and I love to hear Japanese.. well foreigners in general speaking outside of their native language. Moving on, the soundtrack in Joker game was actually pretty nice. My favorite thing about the background music is that if a dramatic event was occurring, the music will help intensify that specific scene. My favorite song in the entire series though is the ending song by ""Double"" by MAGIC OF LiFE.""Before I get into characters, let me say that I really liked how diverse the characters involved in the show were. There were Caucasians, Africans, Asians, etc none of them portrayed too negatively nor stereotypical. Nationalities such as Germans, weren\'t exploited as negatively as they are in any other ""Historical"" anime genres. I like that there was a sense of respectfulness to other cultures in certain parts of the story. Characters wouldn\'t use offensive words to refer to each other. So that was dealt with very maturely. I think character growth is the most important factor of the series. It\'s crucial for the spies to grow and develop their skills otherwise they\'ll just end up dead as you\'ll see in the show.I think what I enjoyed most about the series is that no matter what episode I was watching, I felt like the enjoyment I had watching were so good that I couldn\'t help but share what I thought was going to happen next with my mates. I think anticipating what\'s going to happen next episode is perhaps what makes this series so exiting to watch. The mysterious element along with drama just kept me coming back for more! Overall I would recommend Joker Game if you want to watch something generally interesting, easy to watch and understand. or plot is about, dramatic.

It\'s first and second episode sets the stage for a season of a psychological thriller with spy action. However, we quickly jump into the story of another member... then another... and I stopped there for I fear that another will be after, and I fear that the enitire season will be devoted to introducing characters and having no ""real"" overarching story (other than they all belong to a spy organization).Should any of this change, I will finish the season and update this review.STORY: 5 of 10As of episode 6, it seems as if...there will be no overarching story. Instead, Joker Game will explore each character in sequence and be more episodic. These individual stories are good, but it\'s not what the first two episodes promise.ANIMATION: 5 of 10The character designs begin to get a little weird around episode 4, and the action sequences don\'t seem to flow so well.SOUND: 8 of 10Solid soundtrack and VAs. No complaints here.CHARACTERS: 6 of 10We get to know each character individually (if what has occurred continues to occur). So why the low score? The opening episodes show these characters as a group… I\'d rather they fulfill that promise and show us development in terms of group dynamics with flashbacks.OVERALL: 6 of 10Joker Game is fine and even enjoyable. It\'s substantive, and as an episodic series, it could work. However, that\'s not what it promises, and I just couldn\'t get over that. Baccano, a similar series, does a much better job of introducing individual characters and tying them into a larger picture.If I had a guarantee that Joker Game was a 24 episode series and that it would attempt the same thing, I\'d recommend it.

As it stands, I\'ll pass.', 'Joker Game. Seeing that title already has my interest when examining the words of it on the surface. Joker implies that there will be tricksters in the series while game has a broad meaning of contesting between individuals. Yet, this show isn’t about a game. It’s about spies during a tense period of time when the world is at war. If you’re a fan of crime thriller, detective stories, and political conflicts in society, then this show will be a wild ride for you.Starting off, the series is based on the novel of the same name. Prior to the anime adaptation, it had already received...a live-action film. The premise is similar and the setting takes place during the heightened stages of World War II. What does that mean? It basically shows that Joker Game is no stranger when it comes to political schemes and propaganda. The series has a good degree of realism as it portrays characters with their own ideals, goals, and purpose in the show. Furthermore, we get a concrete idea about what’s at stake during this time period. In retrospect, Joker Game does a fairly well job at getting the audience to understand the show by showing and telling.In essence, Joker Game’s story structure follows more of an episodic stage. In other words, the show focuses on a different spy each episode as we learn individually about their story. It also explores their personalities quite well as the episodes focuses exclusively on them on a personal level. What’s common about each episode also shows how they view the conflict going on during this period of time, which is fairly interesting if you envision yourself as these characters. Later on though, the show does focuses on a more developed story that stays consistent with the overall premise. Another point to bring up is that the show also explores the side from the enemy point of view. In this case, Japan’s enemies. It brings another interesting perspective to show the ideologies of various nations beyond just Japan.Characterization takes on a more personal approach for most of the characters. They get their spotlight and often play around with the audience about their real intentions. The theme of double agents come to play often in the show as no one can really be trusted. In the spy world, it’s easy to formulate that Joker Game is like a game of itself. The characters needs to play their cards right to win. This can be true especially for the D-Agency against rival spy organizations such as the Wind Agency and Secret Service of Great Britain. And while the series doesn’t have a true protagonist, it’s clear that Yuuki (the founder of the D-Agency) plays a prominent role to piece together events for the story. It’s also interesting to learn more about his background too and the origins of the very organization he created.To enjoy watching Joker Game, the key is perhaps to finding an attachment to the characters. Each of them has their own talents, weaknesses, personality, and characteristic that make them an ideal spy. For instance, Amari is the type that can talk his way into almost anything. On the other hand, Fukimoto is the more silent type who uses his knowledge to get things done. Jitsui, who seems innocent on the outside is dangerous man from the inside. Kaminaga is also a man worth noting for his desire to accomplish anything at hand. Then, there’s Miyoshi with his sarcastic personality and difficult to read from any point of time. There’s more but you get the general idea. The idea is that D-Agency is not to be underestimated given what their core members are capable of. Their roles in the series varies but all of them meets the expectations of what spies should be. For the audience, I think that can be quite appreciable.Production I.G helms the animation of the show and in essence, they do a good job at constructing the historical settings. The series’ eerie atmosphere also gives a mysterious vibe supplemented by well-coordinated choreography. However, one irk about the show is perhaps all the main characters looks very similar. While this may or may not be intentional, it can be rather confusing. Regardless, Production I.G. adapts high quality when it comes to visuals and shows once again their talent.To me, the soundtrack of Joker Game is poetic. It’s poetic in the sense that the music focuses beyond just what it is. In other words, the OST is composed for a purpose to craft suspense especially with the soft paced piano tunes and eerie feel. OP and ED theme songs are also artistic with various symbolisms and catchy lyrics. Finally, voice mannerism is quite noticeable in the show. Each character may look similar but the voices can be distinctive different on many occasions. Because the series’ characters are mostly spies, they often talk in ways that is hard to read what their intent actually is.Is Joker Game a good show? Is it worth picking up? That’s actually easy to say if you’re a fan of crime fiction, political thriller, and spy espionage. It’s aimed more towards a mature audience as each episode has a meaning. The story is very serious and rarely ever jokes with what it presents. That being said, characters can be a hit or miss for some fans especially for their roles. For everything it does, it’s still quite a spy adventure of rare breed. a live-action film. The premise is similar and the setting takes place during the heightened stages of World War II.

It’s poetic in the sense that the music focuses beyond just what it is. In other words, the OST is composed for a purpose to craft suspense especially with the soft paced piano tunes and eerie feel. OP and ED theme songs are also artistic with various symbolisms and catchy lyrics. Finally, voice mannerism is quite noticeable in the show. Each character may look similar but the voices can be distinctive different on many occasions. Because the series’ characters are mostly spies, they often talk in ways that is hard to read what their intent actually is.Is Joker Game a good show? Is it worth picking up? That’s actually easy to say if you’re a fan of crime fiction, political thriller, and spy espionage. It’s aimed more towards a mature audience as each episode has a meaning. The story is very serious and rarely ever jokes with what it presents. That being said, characters can be a hit or miss for some fans especially for their roles. For everything it does, it’s still quite a spy adventure of rare breed.', ""Jokah Gaemu is some sort of historic thriller drama that’s all about deception, just like how it deceived everyone into thinking this anime would actually be interesting. A series about a secret agency of spies set around World War II made this a lot more ambitious than the easy-going series that led its season, but alas, concept isn’t everything.The biggest problem for me was that Joker Game isn’t engaging at all. There’s no reason to get invested into anything. Who are these people? What are they doing? What’s the point? ...Why should I care? The episodes are structured very poorly, where we only have a...vague idea of what’s going on in the beginning, and for nearly twenty minutes you watch someone you don’t know anything about do stuff for… some reason, and then the last few minutes before the credits are spent going over everything: what was actually happening, what the spy’s strategy was, and what context it has for the present and the future. It feels like taking a physics test in English class. How was I supposed to know this shit?The other biggest problem is that the show is episodic. There are two two-part episodes, but each new story is just a new spy in a new situation with no reasons that no one cares about. Which is a shame, because the first two episodes seemed to have some idea of what to do with the series; it was about some dude from the army coming in to watch the Dickhead Agency or whatever and work with them. Something like that. And even though this guy is a fucking idiot, his contrasting beliefs with the spies and their leader had something going on here, I figured this would be about all these guys together. Nope. After this small arc, the army character is nowhere to be found while the spies split up around the world to live boring lives and somehow contribute to… something.Ironically, the last episode had a theme and conclusion similar to the first arc, so it makes me wonder what the hell this was actually supposed to be about.In the end, I know nothing about any of the characters or the story, if there even was one to begin with. Maybe that was the point all along, to give me identical-looking puzzle pieces and telling me to figure it out for myself. Except the end result doesn’t look very good and the pieces aren’t interesting anyway. If you don’t care much for characters and just want to get some espionage, go for it, I guess. Me, personally, I like giving a shit. I like getting a linear story and getting the details easily. Joker Game isn’t like that.So, uh, the characters. They all look the same. That’s racist.Actually, most of them are distinguishable, but look very much like real people. OH NO! CURSE YOU, PRODUCTION I.G.! Anyway, the problem for me wasn’t telling them apart, it was just telling who any of them even were. As in, their names. It’s a little awkward to think of the central character in an episode as “that one spy guy.” Other than that, they have no personalities. Yeah, I get that that’s the point. That doesn’t mean I enjoyed it, or that I think it was even necessary. I would’ve preferred this being a little bit more about the spies and not just about what they do.Truth be told, I might not have lifted a finger on this if I didn’t see Production I.G.’s name embracing it. While there was only so much they could do, the characters look very polished, and the setting seems good enough for depicting the 30’s and 40’s. But the lack of visual cues in what’s going on is a little annoying, as I go back to how things would happen and THEN get explained. For instance, the first episode contains a short montage of the crew playing poker with the army guy, only for them to reveal they were tricking him. How do they explain the trick? By using shots that weren't included in the montage at all. It only sounds smart because they hid all the answers.Like the animation, there’s only so much that could’ve been done with the sound. It’s not particularly bad, just uninteresting. It’s very subdued with a lot of sombre piano tunes and maybe a jazz track here and there. The OP is another story, being a rather lively alt-rock song defined more by its brass instrumentation than its use of wah-wahs. I like wah-wahs, but it’s hindered a bit by its length, I’d say. The full song is much better, would recommend. And from what I know, it seems to be the band’s debut work, so, good on them. The ED is a lot more of a standard rock song. No wah-wahs, unfortunately. It’s a decent song, though I don’t think it fits the show very well.That’s all. I’m gonna go take a nap, because this just kinda puts me to sleep.Story - 3/10Art - 7/10Sound - 5/10Characters - 2/10Enjoyment - 3/10Spying - maybetheseratingsarealietoo/10Overall - 3/10Favorite character - Yuuki because he gets more than 10 minutes of screentimeRecommendation level - Low vague idea of what’s going on in the beginning, and for nearly twenty minutes you watch someone you don’t know anything about do stuff for… some reason, and then the last few minutes before the credits are spent going over everything: what was actually happening, what the spy’s strategy was, and what context it has for the present and the future.

Any medium going against the status quo and delivering a gripping concept is enough to interest me. In the case of joker game I can assuredly say that I was looking forward to uncovering the secrets that lied beneath its plot and anxious for another historical fiction in general. After the initial two episodes I was hooked, and I had laid out an outline by foresight that I couldn\'t have been more wrong on. Unlike some anime in the recent past that derailed after strong starts, Joker Game simply changed course, and I was more disappointed than...mad at how it ended up.Joker Game\'s inception and development into an anime was very atypical. Unlike directly been adapted from a manga, the series originally launched as a set of mystery novels written by Koji Yanagi. Then it was adapted into a live-action film in 2015, and finally into a manga earlier this year concurrent with the release of the anime in April. Certainly not the traditional method of how an anime gets adapted but I.G must have seen enough promise in the books to create something entertaining. I have a love/hate relationship with episodic anime. If it\'s filler, I generally dislike it. If it contributes to the story, I appreciate it. If it does a little bit of both like in the classic Cowboy Bebop... well I won\'t even go into how much I appreciate that series. The episodic approach that Joker Game took was not my favorite. Maybe it was my preconceived notion\'s talking, But something about it just felt off for me.Before I delve into the negatives, let me first start by pointing out some of the positives within Joker Game. First off, I absolutely love spy thrillers and murder mysteries. When I was a kid I constantly meandered through the cable television channels late on Saturday nights, usually finding myself stopping on an old spy film from the 50s or 60s. I guess I loved being able to solve the case with them or get caught up in the suspense of it all. The spy elements of Joker Game were clearly the anime\'s backbone. Unfortunately this is the same element acting as it\'s Achilles\' heel. I know that most of us would say it\'s near impossible to establish a new setting, characters and a mini plot start to finish in about 20 minutes. The delivery just doesn\'t cut it in that short of a time window. Granted, some of Joker Game\'s episodic iterations were dual episode, I just had a hard time finding it that enjoyable. Some of the spy elements were engaging and suspenseful, and I\'d find myself saying ""wow, that\'s a really good idea!"" But unfortunately the moments were too scarce and unpredictable. I appreciate the idea they were going for here, but in an anime it didn\'t translate as well. Sometimes in these reviews I feel like I\'m beating a dead horse but this is another show that would\'ve benefited from a longer air time of about 26 episodes.From what I can tell, the historical information threaded into Joker Game is quite accurate. I\'m no history buff but I do know enough about World War II to detect whether most things are factual or not, and for the most part it was spot on. I actually even learned a few things about the time period from watching it. I also enjoyed how they would incorporate flashbacks into episodes defragmenting the agency\'s origination and derivation. It gave a sort of under the microscope presentation. I imagine real spy agencies like this one existed back in post WWII, which made Joker Game\'s premise that much more engaging. The scenes involving the recruited members of D-Agency getting initiated were intense and regimented, reminding me a bit of my time in the military. The flashbacks containing each episode\'s protagonist also warranted some attachment to their cause, and give them justice in their actions. The dialogue spoken between characters trying to out wit each other was complex and intricate, which seems to be all too rare these days. However, due to the short nature of these episodes I often found the whodunit approach almost irrelevant, since the writers didn\'t really give me a chance to figure out who the spy was before slapping it in my face. Episode four was pure cringe worthy with its plot convenience. I think that was also the point I realized the show wasn\'t going to fulfill my expectations.Perhaps my biggest issue with Joker Game is the characters. In the first two episodes you are introduced to multiple spies, most of which play a role later on in the series. However, they all look so similar in character design that I never really knew or could discern one from the other. I don\'t know if this was purposeful or not but it made some of the episodes extremely confusing, most specifically the episode with the reporter. I swear I had to rewatch that episode ending twice before I really knew what had transpired. I wouldn\'t count this as a cry to be spoonfed information, but more as laziness in writing, since I\'m normally quick to decipher what\'s going on. Some might try to scoff at me and say that Joker Game is not about the characters themselves, but the missions that unfold with in each episode, and I get that. But that doesn\'t mean it couldn\'t of been executed better, because if there were certain things omitted or more detailed, the pre-existing storylines would entirely suffice. Anyone who knows my anime tastes knows that I love historical fiction and would\'ve killed for Joker Game to be that next great genre definer. Unfortunately its issues defined it more than its positives.Besides the cloned character models, the art style in Joker Game was a healthy mix of CG and hand drawn animation. I was initially worried during the opening with the use of CG, and I got scary flashbacks of shows like Knights of Sidonia flooding my brain. Luckily for my retina\'s sake this style of animation was only prominent in the opening and nowhere else. While not bad, with a proper budget Joker Game could\'ve been a lot prettier to look at. Some of the backgrounds were recycled or bland and it reminded me more of an early to late 2000\'s anime at times. The soundtrack was very fitting for the time period conveyed, and fit well within the show\'s opening. It was very James Bond-esque with its jazzy up-tempo beat. Although I like the ending theme, it didn\'t really fit the show\'s personality that well.  While many of the voice actors in Joker Game have some pretty flashy resumes, nobody really stood out to me in the series. And of course I got the odd cringe when the American soldiers spoke English throughout the series. Not as bad as some anime out there but it definitely did catch me offguard. I still remember the broken English line from the second episode when one of the agency members says, ""behind the Imperial portrait!"" I\'m not going to lie I laughed out loud a little bit on that one.At the end of the day, scoring anime on a quantifiable scale is all relative. I have become more critical as I watch more anime and have even gone as far as to lower previous scores for shows I\'ve seen after seeing better iterations in the same genre. That being said, Joker Game is not life-changing but just about any anime fan could find enjoyment in it. Although the target audience may be history fans, the suspense, premise and witty dialogue could render it entertaining for even the most casual viewer. If you\'re worried about binge watching, this is the anime for you. Its episodic approach allows you to start and stop when you please, and makes it a great idea to watch in order to unwind after a long day at work. I would even attach it to a list of animes for people that don\'t normally watch anime. I\'m anxious to see what the recently announced OVA contains in order to extend the franchise when it debuts.

As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my spring 2016 anime reviews!', ""Things to consider before watching this series:-Joker Game is a 12 episode anime based off 4 novels, this anime covers different stories from each novel. These novels were written in an anthology fashion, in other words, multiple short stories that each focus on one of the spies introduced in the first episode and a really non-existent linear plot.-Because of the way this series is written, the anime is largely episodic, with only two short two episode arcs, one at the beginning and one near the end. Also, this anime is the episodic style in which there is no overarching plot, just overarching themes.-This anime, in...my opinion, is largely a niche one that will hit and miss very clearly depending on he audience.-This anime is told non-chronologically.Onto the review:For all intents and purposes, I enjoyed Joker Game a lot. The first two episodes introduced the D-Agency and it's spies, along with who the audience initially  thought would be the protagonist, only to be abruptly introduced to what would be the episodic style of each spies mission. The transition may fool some, and a lot of people may be disappointed by the direction this series goes with the spies. If you wanted a series involving each spy doing something with action like you see in the movies, look elsewhere.Characters: Each episode from episode 3 onwards features a different spy, the only problem is differentiating which spy is which. As far as character design goes however, Joker Game does it really cleverly. Since the audience barely has time to register the names and faces of the spies, when it comes to their feature episode its hard to tell who's who. But that's the whole point of their designs, as spies they're supposed to blend into the background. In the novels, it's not even specified which spy does which mission, it was all on the  anime director to choose which spy did what. The spies themselves aren't exactly developed characters as some people would like, but in each episode they feature in, you can see they do have some distinct traits and methods of espionage (best way to recognize them is by their voices).Individually, the spies don't have much going for them as characters. Collectively however, what each spy does is indicative of the ideals that drive the D-Agency as a whole: Done Die, Don't Kill. If there was ever a main character in this whole anime, it would the be spymaster Yuuki himself. He is the mastermind who trained and oversaw the spies. Yuuki is a man of mystery, but is also the most compelling of the cast, because the audience ends up knowing the most about him, while also not knowing anything about him at all.Story: Each episode is fascinating in showing the different sides of conflict during the war. As this anime is about espionage, the spies it feature prominently are the members of D-Agency, but other times one off characters from all sides of the conflict. It works much better than it sounds because of the way each individual story is handled. The audience is given insight into the many different sides to a life of espionage, from being taken by the enemy for information, to being the the background to manipulate from behind the scenes, to being able to live a life of solitude knowing that you'd likely die alone for your cause. Generally speaking, you get thrown into the episode not knowing anything, but by the end understand everything that has transpired. I think the only problem is the execution of each mission, as a lot of moments in the episode that seem insignificant at first are all just revealed in the end to be a key part in completing the mission. The audience doesn't know what to look for, so the reveals themselves are big 'wow' moments, but I would have liked it a little better if the audience had a chance to understand the truth behind the spies actions before things happened.  The central themes behind the grim reality of being a spy are there, as is the central idea of playing the 'joker game', one of deception and knowing who is on which side.Sound: Jazzy opening aside, the soundtrack for this anime is subdued, with only a few recurring piano pieces and a few tense themes for certain moments. Instead, this anime is carried solely by its compelling dialogue between characters, and to me, it just works.Overall Enjoyment:Joker Game to me was a fun series. I went into it without expectations, and I suspect that is why I enjoyed it more than most. I appreciated it for what it was, and followed each story to the end, ready for another one, wondering where in the world a spies mission would take place. As for it's ending, you could say it was anticlimatic, but I think it just brought its point home as to what is was going to be: a series revolving around the solitary but intriguing life that is a Japanese spy. my opinion, is largely a niche one that will hit and miss very clearly depending on he audience.-This anime is told non-chronologically.Onto the review:For all intents and purposes, I enjoyed Joker Game a lot.

One of them is joker game. I was enthusiastic about the military drama anime but, after some thought, i said to myself that ""oh this is gonna end up like those mecha military drama with romance and stuffs but ill try watching ep 1, i mean, who knows?""Keeping that in mind, i watched ep1 and holy moly i...was surprised. Joker game was at the end of my list but it quickly rose to no1. Especially with ep1 ending with a cliffhanger, i cant get my head off of it.Then ep 2 came, the reveal was great and real, and i cant wait for ep3. But ep3 came out and i was very surprised to see a new character, a whole new setting, and a new everything. I thought that ""oh its just a side story i guess"" but ep4 came and its a different man again. But i was not disappointed at all. Sure some episodes need a replay for me to wholly understand, and it took me half the series to memorise the characters, but at this point isnt it just the same? They are spies, and i bet one person can do every mission from the anime (am i kind of biased lol). So i didnt take it as a flaw. The character designs are also good. I can differentiate everyone at early stages, but i just didnt remember their names yet. The only ones whom i find hard to differ are fukumoto & odagiri and jistui & hatano.The anime is also not completely fictional. There are mentions of real spy agencies, and some characters who appear in the anime are actually real life people. I was curious and i end up searching for more information. I guess joker game made me know more and learn some things about history, in one way or another lolIf you dont set this anime to be something you thought of, it is really enjoyable. Espescially when this anime send you a \'serious vibe\', no fan service, no unnecessary stuffs. The episodes are really smart, although sometimes its kind of unrealistic. (Nothing is perfect, guys. Nothing is perfect)So if youre up to some serious and smart stuff, im going to push you hard on the back to watch joker game! was surprised. Joker game was at the end of my list but it quickly rose to no1. Especially with ep1 ending with a cliffhanger, i cant get my head off of it.Then ep 2 came, the reveal was great and real, and i cant wait for ep3. But ep3 came out and i was very surprised to see a new character, a whole new setting, and a new everything.

Nothing is perfect)So if youre up to some serious and smart stuff, im going to push you hard on the back to watch joker game!', 'Skip to what to expect and personal enjoyment if you’re too lazy to read an in-depth review of the animes flaws. Moreover, enjoy this!Joker game, as a whole, is an anime that revolves around duplicity, as given a notion from the genuine card game “Joker game” and how it’s about trickery. To zest things up and strengthen the theme it’s trying to illustrate, its setting takes place around 1937 and onwards, WWII, an era of which espionage was highly crucial to attaining the intelligence of other countries’ social and economic situation, holding benefits for another country and side, all of which consist of deception, counterintelligence,...extreme mental and physical preparation, coherent yet cautious thinking and generally throwing away one’s life, only to morph themselves as nonexistent beings.And as to no surprise, Japan has decided to create a secret spy organization known as the “D-Agency”The concept that seems to swirl around Joker game is how it believes that having a dissimilar concept from the other animes instantly makes the anime good, thus giving them no reason to panic or reconsider their story. However, because of this way of thinking, the flaws that Joker game includes completely flies over their heads because nothing is simply telling them the defects that are involved in the plot. In other words, just because Joker game has a distinctive concept does not give it the excuse to poorly execute everything else, which is exactly what Joker game performed throughout the whole series; which leads me to explain the negatives of this show.The premise of the Joker game wasn’t bad but was huge foreshadowing of what Joker game had the potential to be. It demonstrated a supposedly overarching plot, which is what created my high expectations for this anime; however the exposition of the card game “Joker game” was when I grew fairly low expectations for it. It was pure info dumping. The anime never gradually unfolded itself for me to get that the game is about trickery. Funny enough because they never exposed everything that the spies were doing when they were playing the game, completely hiding the concept of the game from the audience, only to explain it themselves and make themselves look clever. No matter what, a mystery story is never good when it hides crucial information from you, and that’s what Joker game presented.Speaking about there being an overarching plot, I want to get more profoundly of that. The first two episodes were very misleading because we were initiated a supposed protagonist, as to which he literally was the observer of the story. We were being told the story through his mentality but were given a huge middle finger when the third episode was in an episodic format, where the protagonist was nowhere to be seen again. The episodic format is generally what left a huge scar on Joker game to begin with.  We barely even got a perception of any of the characters except a quick in-depth back-story of Yuuki but as ZephSilver stated, he still feels like an enigma.The anime suffers from horrible deliverance with its story. It’s really difficult to grasp what is going on. There’s no correlation with the episodes and it leads itself into an abyss of nothing. No outcome is given prior to the episodic stories, making the episodes meaningless and a waste of time. The only reason why you should watch the episodes are to solely educate yourself about the particular stages of espionage, what it takes to be a spy, and how conditions and consequences were for those that use to do espionage back in WWII, other than that, don’t bother with the episodic formation.This is purely a paragraph of subjectivity but Joker game likes to use a “Tell, not show” technique on itself, which is incredibly bad for a mystery and suspenseful anime. It’s most definitely tolerable because you get use to it, however, that should be one of the first thing a mystery anime should shun, and Joker game openly embraces this.The character designs and the lack of traits to the spies was the most exasperating thing I had with the art and characters of the show. However, the character design is not a negative of the show because they deliberately have to look bland, but rather the lack of distinctive characteristics is what added to their blandness. Just because they’re spies doesn’t give an excuse to hide themselves from the viewer as well. There is no unique trait to define each individual. All you pretty much see is the story jumping from character to character. I can’t even judge on whenever of not they were shallow because there’s nothing to criticize about them, as much as there is to invest in them. Joker game fails at trying to be compelling because they never got the audience to care from the very beginning. I don’t care about any of the characters, so why should I care for anything else? Our so called protagonist that appeared in the first two episodes was very inconsistent and constantly jumped to conclusions. Just because it makes sense in his mind doesn’t mean it will make sense the way he forms it. He generally just stopped using coherence.Sorry, these two paragraphs will consist of vague and fairly heavy spoilers.Bonus: Episode 4 probably has to be one of the worst episodes out of Joker game and exactly goes by what I say when I state how this anime can be exaggerating. The ending of the show was just adding tragedy on top of tragedy like an ice-cream man adding marshmallow and chocolate on top of another. The show has just come to great cognizance, as to which the random guy revealed his wicked plans and then boom! He’s shot by a random black dude that no one cares for, simply for vengeance of this other dude that no one also cares for, which was out of love (Now who would of thought that?)Okay, can someone tell me, what the hell was up with that one liner? Is that it, is that all we’re being served? A futile one liner that will not tell us about what happens to that “random spy dude” Honestly, it didn’t feel like a finale and it still needs more to convey, albeit Joker game has conveyed some positivity amongst the defects of theirs.Joker game had a dull but rather okay art, it didn’t disrupt the anime really and its animation was perfectly fine. As one stated, they make a good balance between the CG used and its normal animation.  Joker game has a brilliant opening, however, sadly doesn’t portray what Joker game actually expresses. Despite that, it was a nice jazzy opening and fitted the anime’s default genres. The ending theme however, sounds like some upbeat J-pop and is completely out of theme. Even though it’s one of my favorite endings (I listen to it on my MP3 player on the bus to school every day!) I’m going to stay impartial here and state what I truly feel. The ending sounds good on a standalone but when merged with Joker game, it’s just awkward. This is what brought itself down on the music department.Even though I judged Joker game for how they depicted their refreshing concept and how they poorly do such, I give credits for Joker game for even doing the concept. Not many do detective-like mystery stories within the anime medium and for Joker game to do something so revitalizing for once takes balls. Joker game could have been an anime that sold unsuccessfully due to its unpopular idea but they still chose to do it nonetheless, and I applause that.Joker game never loses focus on what they are portraying, regardless of how poorly they are doing it. They always stay on theme, they never break character and they never handle matters in a juvenile sense. The overall presentation of the series (art, music, animation, theme, etc.) gives off a rather serious tenor to the series, which is exactly their objective, and they don’t do it badly.Generally, Joker game was historically accurate with the depiction of espionage and how it would take place in WWII. Everything was pretty much dead right considering how I was previously learning about WWII and how I would research a few stuff from the facts that Joker game would mention and view them on Wikipedia. I guess I gained some knowledge from Joker game and it has convinced me into wanting to know more.What to expect and personal enjoymentBut the real question is, did I enjoy this?Not necessarily.  I’m quite neutral on this actually. Even though Joker game gave off a solemn nature to itself, never breaking out of such, it started to alter itself into complete monotony, making the episodes less exhilarating to watch each week. Joker game is not a seinen through its story, but rather its atmosphere, circulating around a mature, controversial and sensitive theme. I advocate this anime to chiefly adults or younger kids and teens that are tolerable with serious yet unenthusiastic themes.Be bound to anticipate a dissatisfying ending, misleading premise, cheating mystery, no connection between the episodes, vague yet bland characters, and many, many more. Joker game is very considerate with its presentation, but was sadly missing that good writing, consequently making it inferior to its presentation.Joker game doesn’t deserve an anime. Joker game should have never been brought to existence in the anime medium because it doesn’t meet that anime-like realm, but rather is solely just novel worthy. The books actually look pretty darn good; however the anime doesn’t really promote how fine the original material looks but rather makes people shun it whilst simultaneously cut all ties with Joker game. In conclusion, Joker game succeeds in exploring the fundamentals but fails on the fine details. This is an anime that tackles pragmatic themes, however executes that within a medium it doesn’t need to be in. Joker game is most definitely one of the most distinctive animes this spring season, therefore making it dissimilar in contrast to the other animes; however you will soon come to realize its superficiality when you start to watch the anime for more than 3 episodes, making it an anime worth dropping. Even though I didn’t read them, get the books, the anime is not worth your time to waste, especially when it comes to no conclusion.Negatives•\tOur so called protagonist is very inconsistent and jumps to random conclusions•\tShould have been an overarching plot rather than episodic•\tJoker game likes to consistently “Tell, not show” which is incredibly bad for a mystery and suspenseful anime•\tVery poor deliverance/execution of the plot and no connection -•\tVery hard to differentiate between the spies.

Now, I'm a big history nut, and I love stories about spies, so it's only natural that I would enjoy this anime. However, what was unexpected was the episodic nature of this show. To be honest, I was at first disappointed when I saw that we wouldn't see all the characters interacting with each other, but as it went on, I became hooked.In D-Agency,...there are 8 genius spies, led by a mysterious man named Lt. Col. Yuuki. Each episode focuses on a spy on a mission, save for episodes 1 and 2, which introduce us to the spies through a military man named Sakuma, and episodes 8 and 9, which were two parts of a double episode for one of the spies.Since there isn't an overarching plot, it's clear that many people would be turned off. Even more so, it's really hard for a lot of people to remember which spy is which and what their names even are. None of the spies' real names are told (save for one), and the names the viewer knows them by are all aliases. This, on top of the fact that they are natural born actors who can easily fake a personality, is a big turn off to a viewer looking to identify with them. They aren't relatable in any way, and they aren't emotional characters that the audience can easily pity. They're spies, after all; they can't let their emotions or fake personas get the better of them and potentially screw up their missions.That is precisely what makes them good spies. They're more monstrous than anything, but at a certain point in time, the viewer gets hit with the shocking realization that yes, they are human as well.More so, this anime makes you think. Normally, I don't like introspective detective-y anime because the way they solve mysteries is so hard for the viewer to grasp, even with explanations (such as Subete ga F ni Naru), but somehow, with Joker Game, I didn't have that hard of a time. I think it's because they give you all the pieces of the puzzle, but don't explicitly spell out the solution-reaching process to the viewer. The spies figure out the solution and succeed in their missions. Supporting characters piece things together, and we as viewers get to look back and see if we can understand for ourselves just what was going on.Overall: This anime is absolutely and clearly NOT for everyone. In fact, I'm 100% certain that there a majority of anime viewers wouldn't take the time to piece things together and therefore wouldn't like this anime. But if you take the time to understand the plots of each mission and who the characters are themselves, it is a truly fascinating and enjoyable watch. there are 8 genius spies, led by a mysterious man named Lt.

However, it is not the job of a show to adhere to expectations as it is simply impossible to satisfy everyone’s wants. And while it is not our job as viewers to come into a show without expectations, Joker Game can be enjoyed and appreciated much more if common expectations of literature are ignored.Plot is a term that comes up a lot in writing; it is the foundation that spectators can latch on to and it provides a continuous direction to keep people enticed.

An army man named Colonel Yuuki, starts a clandestine spy agency, known as D-Agency, to gather intel on the planned out terror attack against Japan.The characters stand out throughout the anime, as their stories are narrated by flawless narration. Colonel Yuuki proves to be a powerful and mysterious character, and his transformation in the end, proves to...be quite a heart warming one, albeit a dangerous gamble.The sound tracks are peppy, hummable and easy on the ears.Watch it, if you are a fan of spy thrillers, and be prepared for some logical mind bending. be quite a heart warming one, albeit a dangerous gamble.The sound tracks are peppy, hummable and easy on the ears.Watch it, if you are a fan of spy thrillers, and be prepared for some logical mind bending.', '""Not James Bond, not Hollywood"" as quoted in random curiosity final impressions. you may get the wrong impression from the genres (Drama, Historical, Military) to think that this anime is an espionage drama with a building narrative. But you would soon change that impression, because the anime is an episodic thriller (mystery) full of perfectionists that are exceptionally good at everything ( can speak 6 languages - make bombs out of flour - have exceptional agility - always win). While this anime may not be everyone\'s cup of tea (James Bond haters TT_TT), it\'s important to know that it\'s not your average James bond movie....If i am to add 2 more genres to describe the anime, they would be psychological and mystery. While normal espionage movies are full of badasses with no actual purpose but saving girls and drinking wine at the end of the movie after killing the villian, This anime delivers a message at the end of each episode to help the overall theme. It\'s also different in many other aspects, one being that the motto of the D-agency ( the spy agency) is ""Dont\' die, don\'t kill"" and it is very unique to the the anime. now to the rating:-------------------Story :  7/10 This is partly because of the episodic-nature of the anime and the sense of inconsistency in the order of the events. well, it\'s still arguable since the anime is based on an episodic novel with random chapters.------------------Music: 9/10 The music was the best part of this anime. the opening and the ending of each episode, which btw i never missed, fit very well with the anime\'s atmosphere and title. The BGM which is basically the instrumental part of the ending was also pretty good. It is also distinctive form your average Bond theme, In fact it more of a military theme with a little bit of a rousing tone.------------------Art: 8/10 while most of people agree that the anime\'s art wasn\'t that exceptional, i think it gave me the sense of anonymity in spies. Their faces aren\'t important, ""it\'s the information they gather for the sake of their country that lives on"". The animation was fluid and scenes were consistent.-------------------characters: 8/10 as i said it\'s not their faces or names that\'s important in this anime (or fangirls would be everywhere). I can\'t give perfectionist more than 8 so i will stick with that.-------------------enjoyment: 8/10 this anime is my type, an episodic mystery with an opening scene cliche that is answered in the ending of each episode.------------------Overall: 8/10------------------- If i am to add 2 more genres to describe the anime, they would be psychological and mystery. While normal espionage movies are full of badasses with no actual purpose but saving girls and drinking wine at the end of the movie after killing the villian, This anime delivers a message at the end of each episode to help the overall theme. It\'s also different in many other aspects, one being that the motto of the D-agency ( the spy agency) is ""Dont\' die, don\'t kill"" and it is very unique to the the anime. now to the rating:-------------------Story :  7/10 This is partly because of the episodic-nature of the anime and the sense of inconsistency in the order of the events. well, it\'s still arguable since the anime is based on an episodic novel with random chapters.------------------Music: 9/10 The music was the best part of this anime. the opening and the ending of each episode, which btw i never missed, fit very well with the anime\'s atmosphere and title. The BGM which is basically the instrumental part of the ending was also pretty good. It is also distinctive form your average Bond theme, In fact it more of a military theme with a little bit of a rousing tone.------------------Art: 8/10 while most of people agree that the anime\'s art wasn\'t that exceptional, i think it gave me the sense of anonymity in spies. Their faces aren\'t important, ""it\'s the information they gather for the sake of their country that lives on"". The animation was fluid and scenes were consistent.-------------------characters: 8/10 as i said it\'s not their faces or names that\'s important in this anime (or fangirls would be everywhere). I can\'t give perfectionist more than 8 so i will stick with that.-------------------enjoyment: 8/10 this anime is my type, an episodic mystery with an opening scene cliche that is answered in the ending of each episode.------------------Overall: 8/10-------------------', 'Joker Game is an interesting beast. I love it, and if you\'re a fan of any sort of anthology fiction, you\'ll probably be more keen on it than others who may feel that the story is ""disjointed"". I can\'t say that I would call Joker Game disjointed, if you\'re viewing it as a series of short, immensely enjoyable spy stories, I\'m sure you\'ll have an excellent time with it. If you\'re looking for some sort of master plot that all comes together as the series progresses, you\'re probably in the wrong place. Sure, the short stories are loosely connected by The D-Agency and Colonel Yuuki,...and there is a sort of overarching plot, but it\'s definitely not the point of the series. The plot of the individual stories is quite good; the art was very well done and immersed me in the period; the sound design was nothing special, but didn\'t have any glaring issues; characters were well developed given that they generally had ~20-40 minutes of screen time over all the episodes, although it was hard to keep names and faces straight sometimes.I can\'t say that there was anything more I could have wanted from this series, and I definitely recommend it to those who enjoy short, anthology style fiction. and there is a sort of overarching plot, but it\'s definitely not the point of the series.

Once in a while, we do get some period pieces, which becomes a nice mix with all the other shows airing at the time. Now, I will admit, I got lost several times upon watching each episode. For one, like I had mentioned, history isn't my strong suit, so there will be some...elements that I may not understand fully. Second, being a spy series, there is information and subtle visuals that require full attention. Also, each episode is its own story, and don't necessarily connect with the others. Otherwise, the stories were very entertaining.The characters we focus on are the spies of the agency that the series is about. Each episode has one of the agents on a mission, and as we witness them, we get a good read at what kind of personality they have. Also, the characters the agents interact with on their missions, while only there for that one particular episode, get enough screen time where we see how they fit in with the story.One thing that amazed me was the animation. I believe it is safe to say that the animation done here was perfectly flawless. The character models were precise (which I should add the character designs were unique), and the movements were continuously fluid. Rarely does this ever happen, even with a twelve episode series, since there's usually bound to be a few mistakes here and there. I honestly can't think of any negative thing to say about the matter.Although I found myself losing track of what was going on in the story (some episodes I watched when other people were around, so it was hard to focus), I can still say that Joker Game was a solid series. I probably plan on watching it again sometime in the future to give it another go (might even watch it several times over, because this show really does need full attention).

Possibly because my experience of them usually boils down to watching James Bond shag and destroy his way through an emotionally draining two and half hours, and that’s emotionally draining in the negative. Spy thrillers themselves can generally be split along the divide of either being about the suave agent who beds a sexy Russian and drives an Aston Martin or depict a taut, tense Cold War espionage scenario where all conversations take place through a haze of cigarette smoke (mind you, there is now a modern tendency to make spy thrillers in the vein...of a Bourne Identity). Nevertheless, all spy thrillers present an idealised notion of how espionage should be and how the creators envision it as opposed to anything based on a semblance of realism. The only realistic aspect that all spy thrillers share is the mutual distrust that the army’s upper echelons and government bureaucrats hold for their nation’s spymaster (something which Joker Game is only too happy to reinforce on numerous occasions). So, how does Joker Game approach its world of espionage? What sort of spy thriller is Joker Game?Joker Game itself takes place during the Second World War, a period not often explored in anime, but is the subject of a vast array of Hollywood movies. The anime itself presents a stereotypical view of some of the areas which it takes place in, from the foggy nights of London to the militarised centres of China, via the vast, opal oceans of the Hawaiian deep blue. For anyone who has seen lavish spy thrillers, the settings themselves are fairly typical. The animation, as usual of Production IG, is both sharp and slick, even if it does seem like some of the characters are lifeless. The music pieces are also fairly standard, although special mention does go to the opening for being both stylishly cool and effortlessly slick.Part of Joker Game’s appeal is in its name. Sakuma is a soldier who serves in the Japanese Army as is drafted in a liaison between the army and the newly formed D-Agency; a spy agency under the tutelage of the mysterious Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki. Sakuma is a straight-talking soldier who has been trained in the art of the Bushido, more specifically the aspects involving killing and dying for the state as honourable acts. Sakuma’s army education is mirrored against the citizens recruited for D-Agency, who are taught to never kill and to never die, believing it to be detrimental to the cause. A tension that is inherent, but never fully expanded on. This, as I shall show, is a running theme of both the anime and the review: its inability or reluctance to expand on any idea.Joker Game’s appeal and unique selling point is shown in episode one when the spies play a game of poker and they invite Sakuma to play. He loses quite easily, but that’s not the point. The poker game itself was a charade, as the reality is shown to Sakuma, in that his loss was guaranteed from the beginning. The true aim of the card game was for the card players to foster relationships with those watching the game, who were signalling what kind of hand each player had. What makes things even more complicated is that the card players don’t know who is cheating for who or whether the information being relayed is accurate. It’s a complex and intricate game of bluffs, double bluffs and triple bluffs as the card players try to not only win, but to befriend those who are giving out information so that they are in control of the situation. Yuuki likens the analogy of the card game to the realities of international politics, where one has to not only understand the rules of diplomacy, but also use the rules themselves in order to achieve their aims. In short, it’s an information war where protecting one’s information is just an important as convincing an enemy spy to turn over their information, and it’s in this world that Joker Game sets up its premise.Or at least it would be, if not for its glaring deficiencies. For a start, the way the series is structured is problematic in and of itself. Joker Game follows an episodic structure, with each episode concerned with a different spy and a different case to be investigated and resolved. However, because of its episodic nature, there is no overarching plot running through the series; nothing to connect the individual episodes together. What this creates is a situation where each episode contains a different trope of the genre. Whether it is investigating deaths, shadowing someone, infiltrating an enemy cell, faking a capture or meeting with defectors, Joker Game ticks off all the tropes of a spy thriller and honestly, it’s a bit of a shame.The intrigue of the Joker Game is ignored in favour of unconnected storylines rehashing stereotypical tropes of the spy thriller genre, instead of focusing on the idea it had espoused so eloquently in the first episode. I really enjoyed the opening couple of episodes, and it’s this that makes the unremarkable nature of the rest of the series harder to understand. Yes, the series is unremarkable. There’s not a lot to bite into. The plots themselves are typical of the genre, and are usually resolved with a fair bit of logic jumping in its attempts to resolve the case in the allotted twenty minutes. Mind you, I did enjoy episodes 8 &9, if only because it involved a psychological game of chess as one of the spies tried to ascertain the character of his opponent in order to ascertain his behaviour. Not only am I a fan of chess, it’s also the closest the series got to the concept of its Joker Game, but as soon as the chess game finished, my feeling of indifference returned. It’s a shame that a show which had so much potential ultimately fizzed out into the mean.As for the characters, well there’s nothing particularly distinctive about them. The drawing and animation of the characters makes little attempt to differentiate between the spies, so that they essentially become reduced to looking like a caricature of a stereotype of the spy who’s always wearing a suit and a fedora like they’re on their way to shoot someone for being late with their debt. The only characters who are even remotely interesting (I use that term loosely) is Yuuki and Sakuma. The latter is your typical by-the-book soldier who believes in the army and that there is honour in death and all the other usual traits. Sakuma is pretty much typical: doesn’t stand out and is more or less part of the furniture. As for Yuuki, well he’s mysterious (in the sense that we don’t know much, doesn’t talk and is generally a bit of a dry character). We do learn more about Yuuki towards the back end of the series, but not enough to call him a character. He too is part of the furniture. There is nothing to get attached to, and their non-existent personalities never expanded on. This isn’t helped by that fact that a lot of the episodes are driven by dialogue which is utterly meaningless when the character’s delivering them aren’t meaningfully fleshed out in order to give a bit of energy to the reams of dialogues contained within each episode.Honestly, concluding this review, and my own thoughts, is slightly complicated. The show is typical, the characters unremarkable, the episodic nature debilitating to its premise, and the individual plots dull themselves. I will not disguise my ambivalence towards spy thrillers, and their reliance on illogical and reactionary plot twists, cigarettes, unrealistic car chases and absurd villains to keep them going. Still, I won’t deny that I wasn’t mildly entertained with some of the episodes (even if I didn’t know which spy I was following; why do they all look the bloody same for?). As with episodic anime in general, some episodes are hits, and others are misses. For me, there were more misses than hits. Still, if you’re a fan of spy thrillers, you will enjoy yourself, and if you’re someone who knows most of the tropes of the genre then you’re welcome to watch it, but you’ll have to understand that you’ve probably seen most of the plots before and accept that Joker Game is fairly typical of the genre that it is representing. of a Bourne Identity).

As they say, only monsters, a human without a heart, could pass it. The setting of the series is way back during world war, where every country is lacking trust and wanted to get a hold on each other. Every episode shows different cases in different countries. How they manage to make themselves invisible while they gather the data they need. Though all the episodes are interesting and cool, it is kind of an...episodic anime and has really no story to tell. It's just about nine brilliant people, their colonel included, and how they do the life of being a spy.Characters: 8I love the character of Miyoshi. He is cool and his role show that he really knows what he is doing. And I think, he is also the only character who can be seen on the series for many times than the others. Honestly, I lost track of the characters. I don't know all of their names. Since the characters all look like one another, they have the same blend of hair, they have almost the same smile, it is really hard to distinguished them by name. But each characters have that assets they only have and you can just pinpoint who is who by their faces.Sound and Animation: 10After I saw this series, I remember the anime 91 days, and Baccano!. Having the same era and looking like the creator is the same. There's really no characters that stand up in line with looks. I guess, spies need to look like normal citizens but that fact itself is amazing. They manage to show eight people who won't be regarded by their looks but by their personalities. Every expression of the characters are well shown, even if its the extras only. Additionally, I love every setting of the story where old establishments are being displayed. The opening and ending songs seem to have been picked very carefully as it really matches the theme of the anime.Enjoyment: 9Military is not my genre, but I won't back down when it comes to historical anime. I don't remember laughing even once when watching this series, but the excitement on every characters movement can fill that gap. Not all story needs to have a comedy in it, right? The strategies shown is enough to captivate the attention of the viewer.Ending: 10In anime like this one, ending is like an empty vessel thrown at the sea, without any destination. No happy ending to be made and they are all meant to do what they are doing until they die. It will all just be a different case after the other. The best part is the one quitting his work as a spy since he realize that he can't be inhuman like the others. I don't think there's a continuation on manga since it only consists of 10 chapters but I'm not really sure if there's a light novel of it. episodic anime and has really no story to tell.

The series does not shine in any areas in general but it is not particularly lacking in any areas for its genre. The series is mainly episodic and, explore and depicts the various missions that some of the professional spies are put through. Some missions are especially dangerous, some slightly more emotional than others while some are your typical action packed James Bond-style movies.Story: 7/10 – nothing exceptional but not forcefulJoker Game is a short 12-episode episodic series. With this premise, the writers worked with what they had and the result is a well-paced story that does...not feel forced as character developments and world building are left out on purpose.  Instead, it is straight to the point and focuses on specific areas such as the activities of the spies, mini plot twists and mystery. All in all, the story is satisfying, feels natural and makes me wanting for more (in a good way).Art, Sound and Character: 6/10 – nothing exceptionalThe art and sound is industry-standard, nothing shiny in particular but pleasant to the eyes and ears. There is a single flaw though – some of the characters looks way too similar though it is not really a problem as there is no character development for most of the characters. As for the characters, there is almost NO distinction between the characters except for the Head of the agency, Yuuki whom I love as there’s a shroud of mystery surrounding him. We do not know of his exact backstory (1 episode was presumably dedicated for it though it is just heavily-hinted and nothing is concrete). He is your typical master and super respectable kind of character peppered with multiple sprinkles of mysterious. Yuuki is also the reason I bumped the ‘Character’ ratings from a 5 to 6.Enjoyment: 9/10 – natural and well-pacedAs I mentioned earlier, the series feels natural and well-paced. The writers understood what the series needed; the series excelled in what it set out to do (mystery, thriller and the spies’ missions are interesting enough) while not forcing the audience through poorly written character developments or world building which many series adopts. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed the 12-episode series and felt that it was worth my time at the very least.Overall: 7/10 – an above average seriesFor most part, this is not a series that was on the top of my to-watch list every week during its release (probably the lower middle of the spectrum) but there’s nothing to be ashamed about. In essence, the series is very enjoyable filler series that I can switch off my brain (which I already barely use) and relax. The scoring comes mainly from the fact that the series does not try to pretend to be something that it is not and I greatly appreciate that as it is not common to find in today’s list of releases anymore. As such, do note that the series is more of a humble 7 than a shiny 7 that does exceptionally well in certain areas.Recommendation:If you are looking for something heavy, story-intensive, rich in character development and world building, you have come to the wrong anime. This is more of a kick back and relax episodic filler series that does not involve any fan service, pantsu-flashing cutesy girls but manly, cool and intellectual James Bond-like spies. If you are itching for some light mystery that requires no commitment (hello, Detective Conan :3), you have come to the right place.

Joker Game seemed like a interesting way of calling a show based on deception.The story happens during the years leading to the Second World War, where Japan starts to feel left out of all the spying games going on in the west. In order to change this Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki creates the D-Agency. The premise is great, the three first episodes really set a nice pace, but on the forth one we start to have a episodic type of show, and that surprised me a lot. As I came to find out as I...watched the show, we are introduced to each of the agency spies while they go on their own missions and the only link between most episodes is the founder of the Agency.Don't get me wrong it was nice to know all of these characters and understand what meant to be a spy for each of them, how they operate and how far they are willing to go, but at the same time it felt like the show lost the plot line that was being created in the begging. Maybe that was intentional, maybe not, I don't know but I lost sight of what was going on, and that happened often.Joker Game has also a very serious tone. Everything is taken very seriously and as realistic as possible. You can feel that there was a lot of research into this particular time in history to make the show as accurate as it could be. The art and music are exceptional and probably the best about the show, helping with the serious atmosphere it wants to present.I feel the plot could have been better developed in a way wherel there was a begging, a middle and an end, then again maybe it's not the end, I would watch a second season in the hopes of knowing more about the agency and it's operations. I also think there could have been more character development. Even though we are introduced to the spies almost one by one we don't get to know what motivated them to join the agency or anything about their past. The only exception to this is Yuuki.On the bright side, like I said before the art is amazing, including the character design, everything fits perfectly withe the tone of the show.The sound also plays a great part, inviting you to dive in to each scene. The OP and ED are very catchy and mix well with all the rest.Overall I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to others, specially if you are a fan of crime/mind games/spies/ political and more mature kind of series. watched the show, we are introduced to each of the agency spies while they go on their own missions and the only link between most episodes is the founder of the Agency.Don't get me wrong it was nice to know all of these characters and understand what meant to be a spy for each of them, how they operate and how far they are willing to go, but at the same time it felt like the show lost the plot line that was being created in the begging.

And for that mission I\'m your spy! (Sorry, bad joke)Story 6/10So to be totally honest, there really is not any story here. It\'s about the ""D-Agency"" that trains spies. Or so I thought, because when we get in to the story, they are all fully trained. That is, except for our (Or at least you would think so at first glance) main character, who gets mixed up in...the Agency and has some choices to make. And that\'s only the two first episodes. The rest is mostly episodic about the different missions they carry out. So the story can\'t really be judged, because it\'s missing. That in itself isn\'t really a bad thing. It was kind of easy to watch one episode a week, because there wasn\'t any real cliffhangers most of the time, which I, personally, kind of missed.Art 9/10I really liked the art. It was, in my opinion, kind of ""Edgy"" to look at. Not as in ""New and awesome"", but the literal meaning of ""Edgy"". The lines was very clear, and I especially loved the way they had drawn women. Even though they tended to have many similarities, but much of that fact probably also takes some points from the fashion in that time. It was pleasing to look at, not too many bright colors, and I felt satisfied watching it. There wasn\'t anything I would complain about, at least.Sound 8/10The suspense sounds, the OP, the ED, the background music, the action sounds. All in all I think they fitted really well with the story. I really loved both the OP and the ED, and I didn\'t feel like skipping them at all. The OP really set the mood for what was about to come, and I\'m not all that known in which kind of music that was from the time the anime is set in, but I\'m gonna take a wild guess and say that the OP really had that kind of feel.Character 6/10I would actually give it less. But also a higher score, so I ended on 6.The thing is, the show is about spies. Spies can\'t show who they really are, and as such, it is kind of hard to get to know them, personally. There was some moments where there was clear traits on certain people, but it was just so weak that I rarely knew who was who. I didn\'t learn their names, their age, or anything at all, and to me it just feels kind of empty. However, the story requires it is this way. This is the main characters only, though.I felt like what the main characters are lacking in personality, the side characters make a bit up for. I felt their motivation, I could feel their way of seeing things, and I could kind of put myself in their shoes. Not that I would want to most of the time. The anime is set in a period of just before war, and most characters we meet aren\'t really that nice, but rather hardcore soldiers. So well, it is with mixed feelings I give it a 6.Overall enjoyment 8/10No matter how much the anime is lacking in personalities, and story, I still really liked the show. I like being outsmarted (Not that it is that hard though), I love it when characters gets outsmarted, I love when you really can\'t trust anyone, and it was awesome to watch how the spies outwitted the military. Or didn\'t. Or did they now?It was also a very different experience watching this sort of show, because I didn\'t get to know the characters, and I didn\'t get to feel for them. All I got was to watch, objectively, and make my own opinions on right and wrong.But in all honesty, this anime isn\'t for everyone. If you are looking for an anime with very episodic storyline, action, war setting, with military, and don\'t really mind not getting all the answers, then I would recommend watching. The good thing is that you don\'t feel compelled to watch the entire thing in one go. -This could also be a kind of bad thing though.But if you are looking for a complete story, where everything makes sense, and where you can get to know the characters in a wonderful way, then this is probably not the show for you. the Agency and has some choices to make.

However this anime does make good use of the amnesia trope and even gives the plot twists a run for it\'s money making the D-Agency a company not to take lightly.Where this anime...hardly has a focus would be on it\'s characters but that\'s because Joker Game takes more of an emphasis to the changing tides of the plot and the character actions more than putting the characters in detail plus for the fact that many of these spies goes through the ""amnesia"" trope that trying to dig deep to these spies or think this anime is a character piece is not the best way to look at Joker Game. Narrative cohesion in this anime is even harder to keep track on with every episodes following a different spy or Colonel Yuuki himself and putting them with mystery and heavy red herring backstories making the cohesion just that hard to keep up. Sure plot twists\' loosely brings in the narrative cohesion but if anything the plot effects towards the plot twists or ""plans that are achieved"" are ALWAYS on the background, the only exception is when D-Agency as a whole is on focus.The only character that seemed to get some semblance of character and focus goes to the Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki but like the complexity of the plot and plans of this anime, his character development is rocky and vague and hard to get ""know"" him, his power over others and his precognition/planning abilities however is shown in full force however.The plot twists does somewhat come out of nowhere and some of these plot twists do come out of nowhere a la ""just as planned"", however some if not most are justified as Joker Game subliminally gives you information to solve what the spy in question does to achieve their plan thus the plot twists if not are done well.The animation by Production I.G did a top notch job for an effective spy game anime, from the character designs to backgrounding to the more tense moments, the animation is above average, typical of Production I.GJoker Game is a complex anime filled with betrayals, amnesia in a pre-World War II era and sure the characters aren\'t as fleshed out but that\'s not what Joker Game is about, it\'s about deceiving your opponents and getting the upper hand with your personal information hidden thus moving the plot or plan forward. If your taking a low blow to this series as World War II propaganda, sure take it as a bit of jingoism, but for an anime about spying and using the amnesia trope well AND well planned plot twists, Joker Game ""maybe"" a hidden gem of Spring 2016 but it\'s definitely a complex spy thriller nonetheless, you just might need to see in broader range to see it. hardly has a focus would be on it\'s characters but that\'s because Joker Game takes more of an emphasis to the changing tides of the plot and the character actions more than putting the characters in detail plus for the fact that many of these spies goes through the ""amnesia"" trope that trying to dig deep to these spies or think this anime is a character piece is not the best way to look at Joker Game.

Something is just appealing about going on dangerous and exciting missions. Going undercover to discover some secret society or evil organization is just extremely interesting and fun to think about. However unlike those spy movies about beating your enemy with only your fists, and defeating a whole organization of people with one round. Joker Game doesn't beat the person by literally beating on them, they beat them by outsmarting them.Joker Game doesn't focus on action and violence to defeat their enemy organizations. Joker Game prides themselves on defeating their enemy by out...smarting them, each character is trained not to kill but to use their wits to get what they want. Well they do kill every once and a while, they mainly focus on out smarting the enemy. This is a unique concept that i'd say works pretty well. See when you think of spies you think of your James Bond's who will take down dozens of enemies with a single round and their bare fists. Joker Game spies are much more realistic in which they rely on their wits allot more. Real spies are some of the smartest people in the world, they have to be to be able to hide their identity and uncover secrets while not getting caught. Almost no real spy can defeat whole organizations with only their bare fists. (I know sometimes the truth is boring) Not too mention Joker Game is depicted in WWII, one of the coolest times for a spy movie/anime as they were used allot more around that time to gather information from each side on where they'll attack next.Now allot of people will try to argue this anime is boring and is uneventful, and I agree this anime will be boring for some. However I personally loved this anime, it's hard to follow and will only truly get interesting at the end of an episode when they reveal how they tricked them... For some that doesn't sound very interesting and I can agree sitting through 20 minutes for like 2 minutes of excitement will be boring for most. However it's kind of like a magic trick, see when people watch magic tricks the preparation up to the actual trick is when people are least focused, they're not paying much attention cause nothing interesting is going on, however if you pay attention to the trick you can start to figure out how the trick is done. Joker Game is like a magic trick if the magician explained how they did it at the end.If you enjoy examining stuff like magic tricks to try and figure out how they're done and don't mind an anime not having that much action or a great plot, then Joker Game is definitely worth a shot.

I give 10 for everything : Story , Art , Sound , Character , Enjoyment and overall . AND i am going to explain why i give such high marks . In my reviews , i am still going to mention tastes in anime . Everyone have different tastes in anime so i kinda of understand why people give 6 or 5 .. This is my perspective point of view . Every episode screen different spy at different countries carry out their mission for the sake of their country . IT is REALLY Not easy to make an anime like this . That you...have to get some information about Germany , Russia , China and so on . Especially if its fiction , they have to think of ideas that doesn't sound too crazy and yet so believable . I LOVE how they make this series so freaking realistic like every episode is so different but the way they describes the actions behind the spy is so epic . The voice actors also have to play a very important part role as well . The way that they do their voices so calmly also make the entire anime went to a whole new level . IT just gets better at later episodes when you finally start to get better understanding of how the series kind of works . I Can even say that this is one of the best anime i ever watch despite so much negative reviews though . The idea of spy concept is really cool but do you guys know the hard work that one need to have ? IT is really not easy to make an anime like this so yeah .... Give it a try ....

Call me simple or cheap, I really loved it.For starters, I really don't like the WW themes too much, with some exceptions. I was really piqued because of 2 factors: the seiyuus, and Miwa Shirow doing the design for this here. The seiyuus being my normal factor into trying all sorts of anime is one main reason, and the second being Miwa Shirow, I love his designs and works.Now aside personal motives, first and second episode definitely struck an impact (especially the whole concept during that poker game), I think it's safe to say it did for anyone...who were expecting a lot out of those first two. The second part that I think some might not have liked afterwards when second episode ended, was the different change of pace.I think most of us didn't expect it to be based on each individual characters for almost each episode. I didn't mind this pace, I was pretty fine, I mean there has to be a reason why they did this instead. Maybe this is where I'm being simple or cheap, but I think this might be just a way to work our brains to patch the storyline up like this.When I said the concept above, they (our main chars) really did stick to that, they used normal civilians without getting themselves involved greatly into finishing the tasks. This is the factor that I really have enjoyed the entire series for, they did not avoid the main concept or dodged it. They have executed it almost throughout the entire series.Art. Full on bias here, I liked it. My type of design and artworks. Can't go on much with this.The sounds and everything was just catchy to me, maybe it's because I do like Kawai Kenji but anyways, OST was fine, I was able to guess who was the composer before confirming it. The seiyuus was fine as usual for me, I don't see any problems here but maybe it's just me being simple.Characters? I'm lost here, but in terms of the developments or whatever of each of them, because it was a standalone episodes for most, there wasn't any real place to develop since  they're done from the get-go. I mean...the introduction of every episode basically lets you know how they ended up this way.Enjoyment was there, so in an overall, I would have to give this at least an 8 for starters, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone simply because it's a preference matter.

So you do not really see the motivations of these characters nor have any feelings for them.Overall 7/10It was ok. 7/10 Character 7/10Some characters were bland, others not so much.

There are certain reasons for that. Yet, I think this series has done successfully well with lots of limitation.Story: Story takes place before World War 2 where several intelligence on other countries\' social and economic situation has become a valuable asset. As a result, Japan, has established a new spy organization known as the ""D Agency"" to obtain this weapon. While the history has no connection what so ever to the story, they made it like it was real....The general expectation from an anime series is the story starts from episode one and continuing the same story throughout the series but in this series that hasn’t happened, rather every episode’s story are different from the other with different spy on the mission except for 2/3 episodes and finished within that episode. But each of the events is bringing the main focus here and that is how “D Agency” operates their mission no matter what the obstacle is. The stories are pretty much unique and complex.Characters: You can basically sense from the plot section that with different spies operating in different episode there is no main protagonist but there is and his name is Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki who is the mastermind behind the spy organization. So, basically with different spies are showing different episodes every spy individually gets the spotlight but the bigger spotlight was on Yuuki who strategize everything behind the scene. So, overall character development was good mainly on protagonist side. The only problem that I can see is that there is no main antagonist.Art & Animation: Since Production I.G has produced it has to be good but on honest perspective it was very good.Music & OST: I am not sure this section is one of the strong part of this series but the opening and ending was on good level, inserted ost’s I don’t think so (hear one ost over and over again).Final Thoughts: Joker Game might have gone underappreciated for various reasons. Number one, though it’s a spy based anime, there is also history and drama which doesn’t draw the casual audiences. Number Two, it doesn’t have that broad storyline that will leave mark on the viewers (even the sequence of events are not in order). Burt here’s the thing that Joker Game does bring out even though it has its limitations. One, the direction is very clever and impressive. Two, the stories are pretty unique. Three, on a ideology basis this series was one of the most successful out there that has expressed the ideology almost perfectly (A spy doesn’t kill neither they are willing to sacrifice). Overall, I think Joker Game has just edged past many other series on the spring list and gone at the top.

Overall, I think Joker Game has just edged past many other series on the spring list and gone at the top.', 'Joker Game was an anime that I thought would be either really good or either really bad. Anime has always been a hit or miss with their westernized ones as many of them fail to capture the tone and style of something western. Joker Game manages to accomplish that in ease as it’s a very stylish series, but it also creates many hiccups along the way that restricts this series from accomplishing much more than it is capable of. But Joker Game manages to be a really good “mission-of-the-week” anime that is fairly consistent with both its style and substance, but a lack of a...main and focused story is somewhat underwhelming. Joker Game make you want more out of it.~{Story}~The anime takes place before WWII, creating a fictional story about Japan creating a secret spy organization called D-Agency, where several agents are given special missions that all around the world, which can supply Japan with some valuable information that can give them the upper hand in an upcoming war. If the premise hasn’t informed you already, this is an episodic series, as every episode provides a mission with one of the spies being the lead character of the episode. These missions tend to get wrapped up in the same episode too. Many of these episodes turn out to be quite good and enjoyable, however there are some episodes where the story feels lacking and the episode feels pointless overall. Some of the stories would have benefitted from being more than one episode long. And maybe an episodic approach wasn’t too great. Sure, it is nice to see each of the spies get their own little story and getting the “daily life of a spy” vibe out of this anime, but it would have been really nice if there was an overarching story that gets tied up perfectly well in the end. The lack of a main story (not a main premise) makes the series lack focus. And by the end of the series, you might just be saying “That’s it, huh?”.Story: 5/10~{Presentation}~Probably the best thing about Joker Game is how they nailed the setting and the atmosphere of a pre-WWII era. The way the characters act, dress, think and talk, the way the streets look, how civilians react publicly, all feel real and that’s a sign of a well done setting. Westernizing an anime isn’t an easy task, especially when you have Bebop and Baccano to compare yourself too, but Joker Game manages to gain the style of western entertainment, and traditional Japanese writing to create something that manages to balance the two without making one of the two compartments looks weak. The tone is always consistent in the series as it always adds a political and suspenseful vibe to the series. The series is episodic and it works well for most of the time. But some of the directing in some of these episodes falls weak in comparison to others and the lack of a main story makes this series lack any impact. If it had a major story playing in the background, or if all of these tiny stories tie up together at the end, this series could have been a lot better.Presentation: 6/10~{Character}~There’s a lot of characters in Joker Game, a lot. Well, maybe not as much as Mayoiga, but there’s a good amount of characters. The characters don’t really give a very good first impression as they first all seems like clones of each other, both in appearance and behavior. However, since almost all of them get their own episode where they get a good amount of focus, they end up being more likable characters. That being said, by the end I still didn’t know who was who and who’s named what. It might be a little irritating for some but the characters aren’t about who they are but what they do. By the end of the series, these characters are still very mysterious and we still know little-to-none about them, but that’s how it’s supposed to be since they’re spies. They gave up their identity for their job and that’s why we don’t know who they are, but we know what they do. We may never even know their real names. However, this also causes the viewers to lack any emotions for these characters. If any of them die, I wouldn’t feel much because I’m not invested into these characters. “Oh there goes Agent #6”. The problem with trying to give focus to all of the characters is that none of the characters get enough focus to make them established characters. However, the characters were never the main focus of this series.Character: 5/10~{Art}~,The art itself is very clean and neat in Joker Game. Production I.G’s production values are apparent in this series as character models look detailed, backgrounds are well detailed and well colored and facial expressions are well drawn. My major complaint with the art is how the character designs lack variety. Your main cast of characters look like clones of one another. They only way to differentiate them is by their hair style, so if they ever wear a hat, it feels like their wearing a mask. Their facial designs just feel to similar to one another. That being said, the art is the strongest point of the series. The pre-WWII era setting was very well-drawn as it feels really real and alive. The buildings, clothes, people, all feel like they’re from that era. The art manages to recreate that era in their anime, and it just adds to the style.Art: 8/10~{Animation}~Just like the art, Production I.G manages to make its animations top-notch too. Joker Game, almost all the time, feels very fluid and consistent. There wasn’t any moment in the series where I noticed an animation quality drop. Though Joker Game may not be as action-packed as you guessed it would be by reading the premise, the anime is still pretty to look at. When some moderate action happens, the action looks top-notch and neat. Though a lot of this series is just talking and walking, but the studio manages to do, whatever they do, right. And the backgrounds are, for the most part, well-animated, so it helps in making the images more alive. Overall, it’s consistently fluid and smooth and it is one of the better animated series of the season.Animation: 7.5/10~{Voice Acting}~Joker Game has a large cast of character, a really large main cast. So it would be nice to have a really well-established seiyuu cast and luckily this anime delivers just that. When you have well-known seiyuu like Morikawa Toshiyuki, Nakai Kazuya, Kaji Yuki, Fukuyama Jun, Kimura Ryouhei, Shimono Hiro, Hosoya Yoshimasa, Seki Tomokazu and Sakurai Takahiro, you know there’s no chances of them messing up the voice acting. All of the seiyuu delivers in this series and I’ve never noticed a hiccup. Even the supporting characters are really well done. The seiyuu all manage to capture the pre-WWII era and manages to make their characters have a westernized feel to it.Voice Acting: 8/10~{Music}~There are some ups and downs in the music of Joker Game. The background music is slightly underwhelming for an anime of this genre and setting. Some stylish tracks that match the era, setting and style of the series would be nice. The OST of Bungou Stray Dogs from this season would have worked great with this anime. That being said, it’s primarily the background music I have issues with in this anime as the OP and ED theme songs are quite good. The OP, “Reason Triangle”, is one of my favorites from this season as it’s really catchy and addicting. The music and the vocals of the song is so good and so fitting for this series. The ED, “Double”, is a pretty good song as the vocals are nice. The only issue is that it doesn’t match the anime much, thus it lacks the ability to complement it.Music: 7/10~{Enjoyment}~Did I enjoy Joker Game? Yes, I did. Did I enjoy it as much as I was hoping to do? No, not quite? There are many factors that hinder my experience with this series, such as a lack of a main story as without it, the series loses quite some focus. I didn’t find the characters to be memorable either. But as the same time, I can’t help but appreciate its style and its dedication to its tone and setting. The anime nails the pre-WWII setting with ease, and it might just be the best setting of the season. And some of its episodic stories turned out to be quite enjoyable, especially the ones in the second half of the series.Enjoyment: 5/10In the end, Joker Game is definitely worth checking out. It may not be for everyone, but it doesn’t hurt to try it out. The episodic structure of the series may be off-putting for some, but the series manages to adapt to this structure quite easily. It would have been nice if the series had a major plot in the background, which gets ties up at the end, or if all these episodic stories tie up together to create one larger story. But even without that, the series manages to be fine. The ending may not be the best, but it gets the job done. But if you’re looking for a spy thriller anime to watch, Joker Game’s your best option of the year.+ Very stylish and handles its tone and context properly+ Pre-WWII setting done right and feels proper+ Some really good episodic stories are present+ Every character gets some kind of highlight that showcases their skills- A lack of a main story makes the series lose its focus.- Even with the characters getting focus, none of them ends up being memorable.Overall: 6.4/10 main and focused story is somewhat underwhelming.

Its really thrilling for me and it always makes me feel like ""wow I did not expect that"" or ""WOAH he\'s good"".[SPOILER ALERT]I love the flow of the story. On the first episode shows all the spies being all cheeky and tricked a normal police officer guy (I think) which gives the guy a new information or meaning about spy job. The spies kinda tricked him since he looked down on spy job but then the guy realized his mistake and admit how amazing spy is, its good that...he acknowledge them at the end. Then each episode shows each spy their talents and stories of how they do their job. And the end of anime shows all the spies together again with that officer guy again but this time, we already know about the spies and their talent so it just makes you feel familiar with each of them. You know it just gives you different feels and a sense of deja vu from the first episode but this time, the guy accept the spy help and solved the case a bit different but at the same time similar from their first meeting.And eventhough I\'m not really a fan of character death, the death of a spy in this anime actually make me realize that even spy are still a human. They can also die and it just hurts me because they abandoned their identity and history to just die unknown. But at least they died protecting and serving their country.So for summary for my review, the story is amazing, the characters are great, I really enjoy it and I wish there will be more of this because watching this anime just leave something in me. It opens my eyes and I just really love this. he acknowledge them at the end. Then each episode shows each spy their talents and stories of how they do their job.

More information on my rating system is in the video description. Now it is time to vomit language as I begin a potentially spoiler filled review.Joker game is a very pretty show. Many backgrounds are wonderfully detailed and the architecture is generally consistent for the time period and different countries where the stories take place. That isn’t to say the animation is all that impressive, it is unobtrusive for the most part but the show does a great job of...having a considerable level of detail in the character designs. You can generally tell the difference between characters from different countries, where German characters have different facial structures from their Japanese counterparts. The first two episodes display most everything wrong with Joker game quite clearly, because they aren\'t dressed up in exotic locals or using stories that center around characters that aren\'t spies. The dialogue feels stiff and fails to convey any sense of urgency. This isn’t helped by the spies as characters as they act ‘oh so cool’ keeping a calm composure and generally looking down on those around them. Then at the end of the second episode as will become a trend in all of the others, a lengthy dialogue scene spells out exactly what happened in the episode explaining points the were obviously hidden from the viewer that makes the reveal feel cheap, even more so on a re-watch. What makes the show so interesting, aside from the great art, is the themes and ideas presented. Episode 3 dealing with how German occupation can turn friends against each other and episode 4 looking at themes of morally bankrupt individuals partaking in murder and pedophilia. The real kicker in episode 4 was how the one soldier reacted after hearing how his boy sex slave had been killed, displaying remorse over the loss of his perceived love rather than the horror of his own actions. There are a few very intriguing episodes and if I were to recommend the series I would personally say to just watch episodes 3, 4, 10, and 11. If you watch to watch the others they can still be entertaining but I found those four to have the best self contained stories. having a considerable level of detail in the character designs.

A spy agency working behind the scenes before World War II. It was interesting because although Japan is technically the enemy during World War II, I like anime that focus on the perspective of the villain since usually, the villain's point of view is as interesting as the hero's.Art: 8/10The art was really good. It fit the anime and it stayed consistent throughout the series. The only problem I had with the art was that I don't know if it's just me, but it looked like some of the spies had similar face designs. I could be wrong, though.Sound: 10/10The...music is perfect. It's perfect for this anime. Both the opening and ending songs are great and the music played during scenes do a good job of setting the atmosphere.Character: 2/10Here's where the anime disappointed me. Most of the characters have no personality. I can't even say they're 1-dimensional because I don't even know what their personality traits are. Also, I get that they're spies and had a lot of training, but they were never put in a situation where they had to think on their own and not just rely on Yuuki's training. Even when it looked like they were in a dire situation, at the end of the episode, we find out that it was all just a part of the mission. I wish something that wasn't part of the mission happened so that they could use their own logical thinking and wits to escape. We never even found out what happened to that liaison who was reporting to Yuuki and the military. Finally, we only get backstory for like 3 of the characters.Enjoyment: 4/10It was hard to enjoy the series as a whole because it was episodic.Final score: 4/10I was very disappointed in this anime. I stuck with it because although it was episodic, I was hoping for a huge plot twist such as all of the missions that the spies completed would come around full circle and be related in some way so something significant would happen. But it turns out that they don't. One thing that was stupid was that it turns out there's another agency that hated the D Agency, but they only appear in 1 episode and never show up again. If that's the case, what's the point of even giving them an episode if they don't even pose a threat?? It's lazy writing and shows that they were running out of ideas. I would've liked if the agencies were pitted against each other such as if the spies from each agency encountered each other or something to that effect. Finally, this is just my opinion: I know that not all of the characters are Japanese, but it didn't make sense when the non-Japanese characters spoke to each other in Japanese! For example, the British people speak to each other in Japanese and so do the Germans! Overall, don't watch this anime. You'll just be disappointed in the end. music is perfect.

You get to meet all the different interesting characters, hear spy stories, get a full backstory of how the strongest of civilians were chosen for the project but sadly, the first 3 episodes are also the highlights. The mechanics between the group are amazing, they even go on their first mission together and that garners up some real suspense but after that, the anime just decides to dedicate an episode for each spy. Now, that\'s all fine and...dandy but it wasn\'t what we were expecting, at least not me. So it starts of 10/10 and then it doesn\'t get bad, don\'t get me wrong, just the pacing drops comparatively to 7/10. It is also pretty important to note that the story doesn\'t move linearly but jumps from point to point so that get\'s kinda tricky and I mean, I\'m pretty dumb but in some episodes, I really couldn\'t tell the difference between spies, maybe because of the way that they were animated but I just couldn\'t keep up and got kinda lost. It doesn\'t give us enough time at the beginning to really notice everybody since there are a lot of them.On a visual standpoint, for me it looked like a masterpiece. Just by the composition of the scenes, the lighting and the shadows. From an animation standpoint, it was okay I guess.I also made a video review about it on YouTube, would appreciate if you\'d check it out. MudanTV Joker Game Review.

Cheers', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)When I was a kid, I would often try to eavesdrop on my parents’ “secretive” conversations.I would be in the basement, playing a video game or watching television. When I heard the pitter-patter above me, however, I would move to the foot of the steps. The door was closed, indicating further that my parents were discussing topics not meant for my ears.But I was curious. I would sneak up and crack open the door ever so slightly. I would then close my eyes and concentrate, focusing only on their words. Doing it so many times,...I eventually got quite good at it. My mother and father talked about problems: other family members, financial issues, and even me (and my siblings) on occasion.When I had my fill, I would creep back down, acting as though I were none the wiser. It was thrilling to me, being able to catch information without getting caught. Very much like a spy.And with spying in mind, Joker Game proves that spies are more than just a bunch of eavesdroppers.STORYJoker Game, despite the title, involves no jokesters. Instead, the anime focuses on a secret group within the Imperial Army known as the D-Agency. And, as the anime oft details, D-Agency contains the best spies the world has ever known. The elite of the elite. In other words, they make everyone else look like jokers.The show itself has a clear format: the first episode introduces the people and the setting, and, for every episode afterward, a new tale involving a new spy is told.To the anime’s credit, it does manage to create different scenarios one after another even if they boil down to “a spy does spy things.” Fighting with the French Resistance, a riddle on a train, and even a competing spy network (called Wind Agency) are just a few of the main events that comprise the season.The show even sometimes portrays the episodes from a third-person perspective. A naïve soldier, a British spy who found the love of his life, and an old German nemesis allow the audience to view the spies in a different light. A light the audience would have “normally” viewed such spies because (perhaps obviously) spies rarely reveal themselves.This standalone format also brings with it one of the show’s bigger weaknesses: no overarching plot.Because all the tales are so segmented, it makes it difficult to care much about what is actually happening and what is eventually the outcome. The anime tries to make the pushback from the Imperial Army (and other relevant entities) a thread. But a lot of the different reasons – from using “cowardly” tactics to supposed besmirching of the army despite the results D-Agency regularly retrieve – strain this thread too much.Although, to be fair, there are certain commonalities between the episodes. Yuuki’s involvement and the World War II backdrop are the more obvious answers, but a more important one exists.Part of Joker Game’s goal is to demonstrate what it is that a spy goes through. Torture, hand-to-hand combat, and death are some of the more extreme examples, but the show also focuses on the subtler aspects. Bluffing an opponent, investigating an area, deception, maintaining cover, and planting false information. In a sense, these details lead to the anime’s title, for, like any intense game of poker (jokers or not), similar skills are required.Unfortunately, the anime does not do too much else. It is simply a semi-thrilling, multi-spy show concerned more with espionage than it is with grander ideals. (Except for their “don’t die; don’t kill” mantra.) Not that it has to be more than what it is (as can be said for every anime ever), but, because it barely even attempts to aim for something higher, it does not do itself any favors.ANIMATIONThe art and the animation of Joker Game is arguably its best aspect.Due to the episodic format, the anime visits many different spots. A British compound, a luxurious mansion, a nighttime shot of a bustling city, a German hospital, a local theater. Such variety helps to showcase how widespread the war reached and just how far the spy network invaded, supporting the main motifs of the show.While the amount of detail in the backgrounds is not anything praiseworthy, the show does make an obvious effort to heighten interest. Some nice cinematography – such as from a tabletop angle or using a darkened, first-person perspective – are nice to see. Changes in lighting, extra civilians walking or sitting about, and the period pieces, like old-timey cars and weapons, add to the show’s overall appeal.(And not the norm, some shots hold symbolic meaning. The cherry blossoms and soldiers in episode two and the hands of a clock aligning with the railroad tracks in episode six hold meaning to their respective stories.)The character designs do so even more. They are slick, proper in their suited attire and handsome in their sharp faces. Them all looking “the same” continues with the spy motif further: not being able to discern one agent from another (i.e., they are all “just” a bunch of classy, young men) makes sense given their profession.Actual animation ends up somewhere around average. Scuffles can and do break out, but most the “action” on-screen is comprised of conversations. Eyes and limbs do not remain static, though, so subtler movements can be seen throughout the show’s run.CHARACTERSJoker Game’s cast is interesting to talk about because, once one starts to, they have already finished.Except for Yuuki (more on him later), almost nothing is given about these men. While it is true that some have minor characteristics – one can do some sleight of hand, one can read writing backwards in a mirror – calling them characters in the traditional sense would be unfair.In almost any other show, having blank characters would be immediate grounds for criticism. But when one considers what the anime is – an anime centered on spies – it more than makes sense.Yes, they are bland, but they are operatives hiding in the lands of their enemy. They have to be unassuming. They’re not like James Bond who has the fancy gizmos and sleeps with the most beautiful women. Instead, they are typical, everyday guys, commoners among commoners.For this reason, they get a pass.As for Yuuki, the anime does (slowly) build up his reputation beyond just a disgruntled man who walks with a cane (for show). He takes the time to gather his agents’ intel. He is absolutely not afraid to confront his rivals. He thinks bowing in a suit is silly.The show also takes some time to delve into his background. Granted, it is not a whole lot, but it proved once more that Yuuki is a hardened fighter, a man willing to even sacrifice his left arm to escape a harrowing situation.Even so, Yuuki likewise has little known about him. In fact, some of the details may even be flat-out lies. Regardless, the information surrounding his character, much like the men he commands, does not go beyond a precursory amount.SOUNDJoker Game’s opening track takes on a jazz-like feel, creating class and smoothness that fits both the show and the characters within. Lots of trumpets and a funky background beat comprise much of the song, and, while it does not deviate too much from its rhythm, and the vocals are not exactly stellar, it is still a passable piece nonetheless.In contrast to the OP, the ending track ditches the trumpets in favor of drums and a faster-paced composition. This time, the song becomes more optimistic in tone, or, at the very least, more uppity in its presentation. While the vocals and the harmonizing are not anything special, the ED is, like the OP, an acceptable inclusion.Arguably, the rest of the original soundtrack is the best part of the music. It may not have anything memorable or even catchy, but it does have strength in molding out an atmosphere. Clanging, ominous sounds. Lots of piano for both sentimental and mysterious purposes. Plucked cello strings to help smooth out some of arrangements. The OST is mostly a methodical set of songs with the occasional tenser piece, fitting well with the show and its overall aims.Lastly, voice acting sees no notable performances.ENJOYMENTI cannot say I walked away from this one holding it in high regard.Episode four was easily the low point thanks to the sudden evilness of the villain near the episode’s conclusion. The entire season was also plagued by the same synopsis that played right before the OP. A small annoyance, sure, but that felt like more time the anime could have used for other material instead.Yet my biggest gripe comes from the cast, for they just are not compelling characters. No matter how intended their lack of characterization, they simply do not make for very interesting people. Their profession, what they do on a regular basis, certainly is. But they themselves are far from any top-character list of mine.I will say, however, that I liked parts of the show. Episode five was perhaps my favorite due to the Robin Crusoe metaphor (although I still need to read the book myself), and the spy himself actually encountered grave danger. I also liked the maybe-possible romance angle that appeared in episode twelve (due to all the talk about Manchuria and the relevant people ending up there).My favorite moment, though, does not involve spying or something similar.In episode seven, the spy whistles loudly, commanding dolphins to come from out of the ocean. I thought to myself, “I wish I could do that.” And thinking on it more, if this small scene happened to be my favorite from the whole season, that speaks a lot about how much entertainment I truly got out of the anime.Joker Game is not a joke, but it does not win any games either. Its art can be nice, and its music can be fitting. Its cast is even technically what they “should” be. But the lackluster narrative and the unengaging content keep the show from shining brightly.

I’ll admit, it was pretty good in the first few episodes. I only felt like it went down after around episode 2 as episode 3 was really boring in my opinion. Although some episodes did make up for it, the ending was lackluster. It showed so much promise but failed to deliver on what it could have been, sort of like Charlotte.Story: 5/10The story is average at best with no overarching plot line and lots of confusing things at time. Script writing is decent for most of the...series but it is better in the first 2 episodes and a few other episodes. Most of the story tries to develop the characters but it doesn’t do a good a very good job with it. It just tells a side story of some of the spies which can be interesting sometimes but most of the time, it is really boring. You only hear of the characters in those side stories and they never appear again and it really feels like all the work they did was for nothing. The title is also called Joker Game which is a game that they play in the beginning of the anime and it would have been an interesting plot point but they don’t take advantage of it and just leave it there doing nothing to expand on it. They also just leave things about spies such as betrayal and deception in the dust. It feels like they had a great idea about the story but they absolutely fail the premise with these episodes about the characters which are uninteresting.Art: 7/10The art can be decent to amazing at time. It has its good moments but it also has its bad. Take for instance the train scene in episode 6. The background outside the train looks terrible. It’s like you take the grass texture from a game made in 1980, slap it onto the ground, and put nothing in the background. Other than that, the artwork is fine.Sound: 8/10The sound is solid. There Op is great and the Ed is fine. Everything else is fine and adds to the experience.Characters: 5/10The characters in my opinion are just boring. The only one that was actually interesting in this anime was Yuuki due to the way he is presented in this anime. Every other character is forgettable though. This is because many of the characters only get one episode to develop, grow, and become fully fleshed out. Now one episode is not enough for this. This makes all the characters feel really bland. Some can be somewhat interesting but most of the time, it is just boring. The side characters are actually more interesting than the main characters in some cases. The German general guy and the British intelligent officer were more interesting with a way more interesting character design than all the main characters. Overall though, the characters felt very average compared to many other series and how they handle character development within twelve episodes.Enjoyment: 6/10I really enjoyed the first two episodes of Joker Game. Although it was fun, all good things come to an end and it came rather quickly. Episodes 3-12 were for the most part, a step down from the first 2 episodes and didn’t give me the same sense of enjoyment that the first 2 did. The ending was especially disappointing for me and I really did not enjoy it.Overall: 6/10Joker Game was a unique show as it was set right before World War 2 and telling the stories of spies, something rarely done in anime. It starts off with an amazing first 2 episodes but with lackluster characters, and with an uninteresting story, makes for an experience that is quite boring although it can be interesting at times. Although the art and sound are solid, it can’t save Joker Game from its story and characters.Watch if:-\tYou want something more unique in an anime-\tCan stand an okay story with okay characters-\tYou liked Baccano!-\tYou like it where each episode focuses on a characterDon’t Watch If:-\tYou need a good story or characters-\tNeed a good ending-\tCan’t watch anything boring-\tNeed a lot of action in the show series but it is better in the first 2 episodes and a few other episodes.

But even if you don't , you may find it also cool and nice if you give it a try."", ""Joker Game is a show that is hard to place. It has a fascinating premise for anyone interested in history, yet seemed to do so little with it. It lacks a clarity in signalling what the promise of the show is. Whether it is going to be some form of grand strategy narrative with the spies as pieces, if it is going to be about looking at the nature of spy craft, or if it is just a mystery thriller. The last one I only managed to establish as a possibility after I went out of my way to see what kind of source material...it had. The problem is that Joker Game never really fulfils any of these very well and the show never confirms with the viewer what it is really going to be about. The tone is the only thing that is established fairly well in that it is going to be fairly gritty and dark. Essentially the only thing it rules out immediately is that it is a spy film in the vein of James Bond.The first story that was adapted gives us an outside look into the spy organization from the perspective of the standard military. The issue here is not so much that the show is locked into this perspective or exploring its premise from this angle only, but rather is that it fails to communicate any other ideas that can be picked up later. To its credit, the first episode is actually a reasonable introduction point and perspective to a spy show. However, what it misleads people into thinking is that the agency as an organization will be central to some kind of unifying plot moving forward.Only half-way through the series, when I realized there was no real through line for the stories, did I do some more research to find out that most of the source material were largely independent short stories. The show's opening exposition monologue implicitly sells this idea that Japan's spy agency will be affecting the course of the war in some way. Though most of the time we are either never told why agents are in the scenarios they are, or how the information they gain affects the decisions of the agency or Japan. Again, this is not an issue on its own. The problem comes from the failure to communicate the promise of the show accurately. The agency largely takes a backseat since there are only a few episodes where any of the spies are working as a group. Even then it focuses on an individual which suffers from a lack of characterization. It is meant to be more of stories of espionage encounters than any attempt to tell the story of an agency's work.The issue with this show as a mystery-thriller then is that the mysteries are largely unsolvable from the viewer's perspective. Some of them are interesting and well done stories, in particular the Asia Express and Double Joker, which had intrigue with a clear objective. Most of the time there is a complete lack of information given to the viewer and the intrigue is generated by having many unknowns instead of titbits of important information that we can piece together something from. For the large part, it means watching events unfold with the only inclination of where they are going based on intuiting where a story in this genre this would go than anything told by the narrative. Again, this would not be bad in itself if the characters were compelling and we were attached to them. But the show largely fails at that with very little done. We have little idea of who the characters are before any of the stories making it difficult to empathise with them or anticipate what they would do. If it is not about the characters or the premise, then what is left?Joker Game was in part particularly disappointing as someone interested in history and historical fiction since it never seems to embrace its settings. Much of their WWII era setting is just window dressing or flavouring to the stories instead of being about anything central to it. You could change this to the Cold War era and most of it would remain intact with only minor alterations. This also means they largely sidestep any controversy or issues regarding historical fiction of that period, especially given Japan's actual history. While this is understandable, it begs the question of why the setting, which is sold as being central to the premise, is important at all. As a result the show feels like it has nothing important or interesting to say. Either as a piece of historical commentary or as a piece of historical fiction since it never utilizes its setting.Ultimately, Joker Game is a show that is run into the ground by its own premise and lack of ability to control expectations using just its text. It is kept vague enough that it is tantalizing to viewers with an interest in it and then never delivers. The episodes that are well done are strictly in the sense of them being contained short stories with a flavour of the WWII era than any kind of larger examination of things. The others come off as mystery for the sake of it since its resolution is obtuse to the viewer. I can definitely see how this would function as a work of short fiction since it seems the main draw is the internal workings of the characters. That has always been the strength of writing as a medium as opposed to the strengths of animation in showing so much more of the world.With that said, Joker Game seems like a disappointing misfit. Even if one were to understand that the series were a set of WWII era flavoured mystery-thrillers short stories, it would still be hard to justify more than a 6 out of 10 at best. it had. The problem is that Joker Game never really fulfils any of these very well and the show never confirms with the viewer what it is really going to be about. The tone is the only thing that is established fairly well in that it is going to be fairly gritty and dark. Essentially the only thing it rules out immediately is that it is a spy film in the vein of James Bond.The first story that was adapted gives us an outside look into the spy organization from the perspective of the standard military. The issue here is not so much that the show is locked into this perspective or exploring its premise from this angle only, but rather is that it fails to communicate any other ideas that can be picked up later. To its credit, the first episode is actually a reasonable introduction point and perspective to a spy show. However, what it misleads people into thinking is that the agency as an organization will be central to some kind of unifying plot moving forward.Only half-way through the series, when I realized there was no real through line for the stories, did I do some more research to find out that most of the source material were largely independent short stories. The show's opening exposition monologue implicitly sells this idea that Japan's spy agency will be affecting the course of the war in some way. Though most of the time we are either never told why agents are in the scenarios they are, or how the information they gain affects the decisions of the agency or Japan. Again, this is not an issue on its own. The problem comes from the failure to communicate the promise of the show accurately. The agency largely takes a backseat since there are only a few episodes where any of the spies are working as a group. Even then it focuses on an individual which suffers from a lack of characterization. It is meant to be more of stories of espionage encounters than any attempt to tell the story of an agency's work.The issue with this show as a mystery-thriller then is that the mysteries are largely unsolvable from the viewer's perspective. Some of them are interesting and well done stories, in particular the Asia Express and Double Joker, which had intrigue with a clear objective. Most of the time there is a complete lack of information given to the viewer and the intrigue is generated by having many unknowns instead of titbits of important information that we can piece together something from. For the large part, it means watching events unfold with the only inclination of where they are going based on intuiting where a story in this genre this would go than anything told by the narrative. Again, this would not be bad in itself if the characters were compelling and we were attached to them. But the show largely fails at that with very little done. We have little idea of who the characters are before any of the stories making it difficult to empathise with them or anticipate what they would do. If it is not about the characters or the premise, then what is left?Joker Game was in part particularly disappointing as someone interested in history and historical fiction since it never seems to embrace its settings.

If you do feel the need to watch Joker Game though, I advice you to only watch the first couple of episodes. After the first couple the story becomes worse and worse.[NO SPOILERS]Story 5 / 10Joker Game's story is not something to write home about. It starts out very promising with a newly established spy agency who have to gather intell for Japan during the second world war. The plot, however, is very confusing and although this anime tries to make it look like all episodes are connected to each...other, all episodes look more like separate stories than one big plot line.Note that there is nothing wrong with a confusing story. If a story is well written, the confusing part can be used to even improve the show. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Joker Game.Characters 3 / 10There is no character development at all. You won't bond with the characters and most of the time you won't even know their names, or who they are for that matter. This results in a lot of frustrating confusion. Characters are boring and seem to be all the same.Art 7 / 10The art is good, but not great.Sound 5 / 10Definately insufficient. There is absolutely nothing special about the music in Joker Game.Enjoyment 6 / 10Not taking into account the last couple of episodes, I did enjoy Joker Game somewhat. The first couple of episodes were pretty good. I especially liked the train episode.Overall 5 / 10In my own anime list, I rated Joker Game as a 6 / 10. I did this because the first couple of episodes were good enough to make this, at least to me, enjoyable enough to not rate it asinsufficient.Since I'm trying to be as objective as possible while writing reviews, I have to take the last episodes into account too.

I didn\'t expect to learn about spy tactics and morales, but it was definitely and interesting plot to watch.The anime basics were all good to me (Story; You follow an organization called D-Agency on all sorts of different missions lead by the mysterious man Yuuki, Art; this is what got me to watch the anime... I was interested in the style and probably the weakest point for me was the Characters; the all seem to be interesting men that have join the D-Agency for their own purposed and morales, but...you don\'t get to learn about the at all... BUT that might also be the best thing about this anime because they are doing their jobs as spies to ""blend-in"" and not be the one\'s that are in or out of any situation)The reason I give the anime a score of 8 is because of how different it is from what I\'ve watched before. It\'s almost like having a whole bunch of short stories come together at the end, but even when it does there is still no clear conclusion to it all. I liked how the animation was never lazy, and nothing seemed like a filler. I just don\'t think this anime was meant for me because I like getting attached to characters and back stories, so it was as if I was missing something while I watched the whole anime.I would suggest this anime to anyone who needs something a little different, maybe to test where there boundaries are with anime genres.In the future I hope to give the Manga a try, and see if they go into more character depth there (I\'m interested in knowing the background of D-Agencies civilian spies, and also see their growth) you don\'t get to learn about the at all...

And I will say I enjoyed every moment of this anime from the very beginning to the end. Although short, this anime has a lot of detail packed into it, when it comes to characters and graphics. This anime is also apart of a back to back genre of anime that I have been watching nonstop. And that is the ""historical"" category. This anime really takes it time when going into detail to explain every single situation down to the very second, from start to finish....I am going to look for more anime just like this one. I am going to look for more anime just like this one.', '~spoilers for various episodes of Joker Game, take caution and enter with care~As it states in my bio, I tend to make the grave mistake of rating a show based on its last episode or its final arc. I watched Joker Game in April of 2020, and now, three months later my opinion has starkly shifted on the anime. I still will sing its praises of being a good spy anime, especially for fans of historical fiction and episodic storylines that do not focus too much on character development. However, I can no longer ignore the blatant problems of Joker Game that have been brought...to my attention, the ones that I pushed to the back of my mind when I originally completed the show.When reading reviews of Joker Game that felt similarly as I did, one common excuse to the non-character development that permeated throughout the show was because the spies are not the main focus of the show. It was the information that they were to gather that should hold the main focus of the character. Needless to say, I disagree with this sentiment. Here I return to my final episode fault and make an argument that each of the spies should have received character development as the spy featured in the final episode did. Odagiri was that spy. We watch him struggle to investigate and come to terms with a person of interest due to her physical similarities to the woman who raised him. In the end, he decides to end his time as a spy, for he knew he could never be like the fellow men in his organization. Now I’m not suggesting that every spy in the D Agency end their respective episode by leaving the agency, but give us insights into the minds of these spies. Show us vulnerability as was done with Odagiri. Spies don’t get to be vulnerable, so show them coming into their roles, fighting their previous emotions, shedding their past by the wayside, and fulfilling the role of what they need to be. This isn’t a character-based show, but give us moments with these characters that define and separate them from the rest of the cast, just as what was done in the final episode. Without this extra flare for the characters, its plot and presentation were all the show had left to succeed in, for the visuals and music were standard.While watching Joker Game, I picked up on the episodic structure as soon as episode three, but in the first two episodes, that isn’t what the show is presented as. The first two episodes are a two-parter and by the end of the second episode, the viewer is most likely under the impression that this show is going to follow Sakuma above the rest of the agents as he comes into his position at D Agency. However, this does not occur, much to the confusion of the viewer. By the end of the third episode, the viewer is up in arms about why the hell we were just thrown into June of 1940 in France of all places, so divorced from the events of the previous episodes. This spirals the show into a path of absolute confusion until around episode five when it is realized that, oh, this is just the structure of the show. And I don’t object to episodic structures. When executed well, the episodic structure compliments a show. But in this case, it offsets the viewer so strongly that a drop of Joker Game is very likely to occur. It drags on, as some might put it. As I look back, it is now clear to me that this structure was detrimental to the progression of the story and characters, and did not maintain viewership as it would have preferred.As I come to my conclusion on this review, I want to preface that I don’t believe Joker Game is a bad show. There is excellent symbolism and anti-militaristic themes that really shine in an anime about espionage in pre-World War 2 Japan. This show was on my favorites list for a reason, but this show has a list of detriments too long to ignore when making an objective review of this show. If you would like to give Joker Game a try, go for it. It is not a bad show, by any means. Joker Game is simply a prime, masterclass even, example of an anime with a unique, compelling premise, but fell through in terms of execution.Just please give me an espionage anime that doesn’t hop around the timeline and doesn’t drag on, I’m begging you.

It is unfortunate that there are only 12 episodes, I'm thinking of reading the manga (it IS that unique for me to want to read even the manga)Both the opening and the ending are enjoyable, specially the ending.

Each episode usually deals with a certain spy faced with a unique set of challenges in his mission.Unfortunately, in many cases, the story was not convincing enough to allow me to rate Joker Game as a masterpiece of...storytelling in the spy genre.

Karada is concerned about her brother, Hiro Iokawa, doesn&rsquo;t know where she has disappeared to and to get him to believe that she is actually his little sister. We are shown that the two girls come to deal with their problems differently which then reflects their personalities a bit more to the viewer. Karada is shown to get depressed, having some emotional stress and brought to tears quite easily showing off more of her child like qualities. Shouko...on the other hand seems to get on with what has taken place while being rather quiet and calm about her situation. However, what goes on inside her mind and what she is thinking may be a different story.There are several other characters of which are involved in this short story that gives use a nice amount of different personalities between each of them. Karada&rsquo;s brother seems to be quite a misterious guy whom of which covers his eyes with his hair quite a lot. Then you have Karada&rsquo;s school friend, Tetsu, a young male who appears to care about her more than just friends. Then ofcourse his older sister and another female friend whom of which seem to be people that support the other characters. Throughout the twelve episodes we learn a little more about each one, their relations with each other and feelings about certain issues.The story is developed quite well in twelve episodes although with a slow pace between them where Karada can face problems which arise that don&rsquo;t always get resolved in a single episode. Some episodes we are given some flashbacks which add more to the development of characters with more insight to reasons and relationships, and how they came across adding a few new twists to the plot. The aren&rsquo;t exactly too much of a surpise however, but not easily expected either. The series isn&rsquo;t always full of emotional and sad moments since there are some happy times with some light comedy and romance added in their too.Animation/SceneryThe art uses a lot of soft, warm colour tones throughout the series, which suits the overall sunny weather nicely and keeps a consistant blend between everything. Character designs were rather good but there was nothing exactly unique or special about each one. There aren&rsquo;t really any similarities though, which keeps a distinctive look between them, hair and clothing styles are the most noticable area for this. Hiro&rsquo;s character design was rather depressing during several scenes where you rarely see his eyes and the facial hair suggests a lazy mood to the guy, while Karada as a child smiles quite a lot using a few more brighter colour tones for her hair and clothes adding a more cheerful look to her character. The child and adult versions of both Karada and Shouko have a resemblance between them so the viewer can still tell they&rsquo;re still the same character which was also another good point as it added a bit more realism to that event.Scenery has also been done rather well keeping the consistant blend of the warm colours in them to detail each of the scenes and make sure the characters fit into them. They aren&rsquo;t exactly over detailed but give the viewer a general idea of the location or setting the characters are currently at without using any lines to define them more. The art almost feels much like paintings in many areas throughout the series, but overall they were decent with a beautiful exotic look to each one of them where light helps add to the atmosphere quite a bit. Animation is moderate throughout without anything too special to note about, where simple actions such as talking or moving are again done in a simple manner.Audio/MusicAgain to be brief in this area there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any major problems with the sound anywhere in this one and keeps a moderate approach to the usage. No problem with the voice acting either which some well chosen voices that worked and suited well for the characters. Both the opening and ending themes are calm in tone, while the latter has a more slower pace to it. Bother were good songs, enjoyable to listen to especially the relaxing ending which uses a fitting sequence at the end of each episode. Background music seemed to be calm melodic tracks but I yet again cannot exactly remember much about them.ConclusionAn interesting story mixed with its emotion and drama, during a slow pace per episode with some developments between the characters. Decent background and character art using a lot of warm colour tones and blends, moderate auid and animation throughout.

It is a tribute to the age-old aphorism, ""Maturity comes with experience, not age."" But most importantly, Asatte no Houkou shows that you can craft an alright drama with any trope, even the most tired or comedic.Such are the main merits of an anime with a ridiculous premise. In this case, our protagonist, Karada, is a 12 year old girl who is insecure about her young age. Tiny and always feeling left out, she makes a wish in frustration to a local altar—a wish to become an adult. To her dismay, this rash wish is...mysteriously granted, swapping Karada\'s age with that of her older brother\'s ex-girlfriend, Shouko, and vice versa. The problem? Karada and Shouko loathe each other, yet they\'re left to work together in secrecy. Or so it goes for a little while.Here is where execution saves the day. The story, not once played for laughs or thrills, takes itself completely seriously. Unlike a lot of similar dramas, this focuses on how the supernatural element affects every character\'s life in one way or another, no matter how minor. It follows the reparation and strengthening of these interpersonal relationships throughout this group of friends, and in that sense, its small scale is a double-edged sword. It provides enough for character development, but limits the scope of a potentially vast story. This all roughly balances out in the end, but it\'s still very disappointing to think of what it could have been.Meanwhile, Karada has to focus on what being an adult really entails, whether it\'s through buying new clothes or finding a job, and Shouko needs to outgrow her apathetic tendencies. The scenes detailing these conflicts are some of the best the storyline has to offer, giving a great insight into what each character is struggling with the most. There is a strange sense of terror that comes with either of the two being put in danger, and that privilege isn\'t abused; since it\'s only invoked a couple of times, it manages to stay fresh and intimidating without becoming contrived, although Karada\'s thou-must-cry backstory cuts it close.Audiovisually, it\'s as conflicted as the story. While the art is soft and somewhat refreshing, it\'s awfully plain (albeit acceptable) overall. The animation itself is a little more mediocre, with mouths refusing to move in some scenes, and shading done almost haphazardly. Thankfully, it\'s all redeemed by some of the best audial presentation I\'ve experienced in the medium. Aside from dialogue cutting through, it is almost like an ambient soundscape at times. There are layers upon layers of unobtrusive sound effects,  accompanied by the occasional acoustic music when necessary. Never too much or annoying, it balances this harmony of atmosphere and song flawlessly, and definitely knows when to be quiet. My only gripe was that I could fall asleep to it.Even though Asatte no Houkou is by no means the greatest anime you\'ll ever see, it is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience. Or an inconsistent treat, if that\'s more up your alley. Memorable for the fact that none of it takes place in a school or on a battleground, but memorable nonetheless. It\'s cute at its worst and compelling at its best, so what\'s there to lose—a few years? mysteriously granted, swapping Karada\'s age with that of her older brother\'s ex-girlfriend, Shouko, and vice versa. The problem? Karada and Shouko loathe each other, yet they\'re left to work together in secrecy. Or so it goes for a little while.Here is where execution saves the day. The story, not once played for laughs or thrills, takes itself completely seriously. Unlike a lot of similar dramas, this focuses on how the supernatural element affects every character\'s life in one way or another, no matter how minor. It follows the reparation and strengthening of these interpersonal relationships throughout this group of friends, and in that sense, its small scale is a double-edged sword. It provides enough for character development, but limits the scope of a potentially vast story. This all roughly balances out in the end, but it\'s still very disappointing to think of what it could have been.Meanwhile, Karada has to focus on what being an adult really entails, whether it\'s through buying new clothes or finding a job, and Shouko needs to outgrow her apathetic tendencies.

The graphics worked, but I wasn't impressed. They seemed rather drab and uninviting. The characters also seemed to blend into one, with only a few of the secondary characters actually standing out. They all had the same set of emotions which consisted primarily of feeling bad for him or herself. Whether about the past, present, or future, all they did was look off in the distance and sigh.It was a bit slow, but it was only twelve episodes, so it was not unbearable. If they...stretched the series out any longer, I probably would have bailed half-way through.My major gripe with the anime is the direction they took it in. The main plot revolved around an older woman turning into a child, and a child turning into an older woman. Now, with a plot like this, it sounds like a great opening for a comedy. Originally, that's what I was looking forward to. Instead, we are given an anime that shovels on lame drama about the two struggling to hide themselves away from everyone, and generally complaining about their state. I was ashamed of the series. They could have put in so many laughs.The reason I watched the anime the whole way through is not because I loved it, but because the story was gripping. You wanted to find out what happened as you watched it, but that was about the only reason I hung on. If you are into dramas, great. You might find Asatte no Houkou enjoyable; but stay away if you are looking for a light-hearted comedic romp. stretched the series out any longer, I probably would have bailed half-way through.My major gripe with the anime is the direction they took it in.

Asatte no Houkou is an extremely emotionally complex anime and I was seriously taken by surprise when I learned that by the second episode, because it starts you off making it seem like it just might be a loli anime, but if you keep watching, which thank goodness, I did, you'll learn that not only is she no longer a child after the first episode, but this entire anime is about everyone, including the adults, learning to...behave like adults.Anyway, Asatte no Houkou is about a twelve year old girl, named Karada Iokawa.  She's unusually upbeat considering all the crap she's been through over the past four or five years.  At least, it seems like she's upbeat.  When she was eight seven or eight, she learned that her parents and older brother are not biologically her family, we never learn what happened to her real parents, we assume they're dead, but a year later, her adoptive parents die.  Shortly after, her older adoptive brother comes from America to take care of her.  Unfortunately, Karada is extremely bright for her age and knows her brother is in a lot of pain over everything he left behind while he was in America to come take care of her.  Over the next four years, the guild of her brother having to take care of her all the time and having to work so hard to do so, torments her.  Eventually, she meets a woman whom was a friend of her brother in America, but the woman, Shoko Nogami, is very cold to her to Karada and treats Karada like a child so much, Karada runs away.  Feeling guilty, with Karada's brother angry at her, she looks for Karada and finds her at a wishing stone near the woods.  When Shouko sees Karada praying at the stone, she asks if she can wish too, and sits down next to her.  As they sit together, the two wish for what they desire most.  And, this is the part that got me to keep watching, When they opened their eyes, Karada had taken on the body of a 20-26 year old girl and Shoko a 9-12 year old girl.  I know that this has been done before tons of times, like with the thirty remakes of freaky Friday and all that stuff, but it was really interesting to see the direction they took it where they didn't switch bodies, just ages.From there on, the anime is surprisingly real.  Like if that were to actually happen to someone, everything that followed was exactly like what you would expect in real life.So the two of them hide out for a while and everyone thinks they've gone missing.  The police aren't involved, since they think Karada's with Shouko, but still, everyone looks for her.the anime is all about Karada learning how to appreciate her childhood and Shouko learning how childish she behaved as an adualt.  Shoko learns that she was jealous of Karada, for having taken her boyfriend away, Karada's brother, and Karada learns that even if she is an adult, her brother will always want to be in her life and that she's not holding him back from anything.There&rsquo;s also a character, Tetsumasa Amino, who is Karada's friend from school.  He's huge for his age and looks like he could be in his late teens to early twenties, which makes him look really bad since Karada was extremely undeveloped for her age and looked six at the age of twelve.  But anyway, he's really cool.He and Karada are in love and he spends nearly the entire series looking for her, even though he meets her on a number of accounts he doesn't recognize her.  He and older Karada spend some time together in the last few episodes of the series and he confesses his love for the younger Karada.Just to spoil some stuff, everyone finds about and comes to believe that Karada and Shouko had swapped ages, which is really cool since usually in those age swapping movies no one knows but them and there's a cute ending that isn't the least bit corny, which made me very happy since I was expecting a very cheesy ending.All in all, it was pretty flawless for what it was going for.  I can't really think of anything they did wrong other than in real life the police probably would have gotten involved.

This was one of the only series she was heavily involved with that I hadn't seen, so I decided to marathon it.Animation/Music: The overall look to the show is very pleasing to the eye. The art and animation are nicely done and remain consistent from start to finish. The animators chose to go with a muted color palette giving the show a very gentle and sweet appearance. The character designs are top notch as to be expected since they are the work of Ikuko Itoh. The only design that didn't really...jibe with me was Hiro, who for some reason looked like a homeless person! He needed a haircut so bad it was driving me crazy. He finally gets one in the end, thank goodness. The music is nice but nothing about it stood out to me. The OP and ED themes as well as the BGM all have a very soothing and relaxing quality that compliment the show. The songs grew on me a bit over time, but I personally wouldn't choose to listen to them on their own.Story/Characters: The story has a good mix of drama and romance. There is a good enough amount of mystery to keep the viewer hooked. It has a strong first half and then it dips a bit and picks back up again at the end. The characters are for the most part very likable but had some annoying quirks. My favorite character being Shoko. I thought she was the most empathetic and for the most part ended up with the short end of the stick. Karada is very sweet and almost too perfect. The poor girl managed to go through two sets of parents by the time she was eight years old which is pretty insane! Her best friend Amino is adorable but he tries too hard almost to the point of obsession. Hiro is the worst character. Dude, I understand that your parents died, but do you have to be a complete jerk all the time? I don't understand why anyone in the show likes him, since he's selfish and boring. Some of the choices he made confused me. I was also concerned the show was going to go into creepy territory with him developing feelings for the grown up Karada. She's only 12 years old and he's 28, gross! The last episode resolves everything, so you don't have to worry about a sloppy ending.Overall: The show is definitely worth the watch. It's not a huge time investment and it has enough originality and eye candy to put up with some of it's slight annoyances. It's not perfect, but not much is.

Karada is a young girl whose adopted brother, Hiro, abandoned her to travel abroad, where he met Shoko--another Japanese studying abroad. Through a chance wish at a shrine the young Karada gains the body of an older woman and Shoko becomes a young child, both seemingly of a desire to gain something they\'ve lost.The story deals with guilt and selfishness,...as all of the characters seem to be motivated by their own ends and desiring their lives to return to an ideal that cannot be regained. In a very symbolic way Karada becomes a childlike adult woman representing the way Shoko was when she wanted to return to Hiro and Shoko is a mature adult child (representing the abandoned Karada).This is set along the backdrop of sleepy rural Japan one beautiful summer and focuses on how everyone deals with the fact that we all do selfish things, hurt one another, and we can\'t just all hug and make up and everything will be better again.Karada vanishes because she is now an ""adult,"" Shoko is now a child but with the mind and desires and inclinations of a woman, creates an additional awkwardness between the characters (in the way of a physical distance) and drives them away in an outwardly symbolic manner of what was inside their hearts.Hiro, at the center, iis neither seen as bad nor good in the way he hurt the two main characters, as we can\'t make everyone happy at once, including ourselves. And there lies the central premise, trying to undo these selfish transgressions by acting rashly only leads to more heartbreak and sorrow.These complex interactions make this one of my favorite anime--mostly due to the subtle undercurrents to the characters. The stark presentation and complex resolution only add to its realism, even if the premise (at least symbolically) is pure fantasy. as all of the characters seem to be motivated by their own ends and desiring their lives to return to an ideal that cannot be regained.

Or that when adult life gets too harsh, you wonder what it would be like to be young again? Well, what if it actually happened? Are you sure it would be everything you thought it would be? Would you regret the consequences of your decision? Could you cope with the sudden change and the impact it would have on those...closest to you?In the October season of 2006, after the airings of the heavily hyped Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Fate/Stay Night, J.C. Staff produced a rather intriguing series called Asatte no Houkou (Living for the Day After Tomorrow on release by Sentai), based on a manga originally created by J-ta Yamada, which explored the scenario of age changing. The story revolves around two females who have never met before but are linked in more ways than they know. Karada is a middle schooler who is rather small for her age but very likeable, one heck of a cook and very positive in her approach to anything in life, but the fact her brother, Hiro, had to return from overseas four years ago to take custody of her when her parents died, is something she’s never been able to live with. The older female is Shouko, in her late 20s, somewhat cold and empty. But there’s a good reason for that. Shouko was once Hiro’s long-time girlfriend in America, then four years ago Hiro left Shouko behind without saying why. Present day, Shouko returns to Japan in search of a new start in life. Crossing paths with Hiro and the person responsible for making him leave her life is the last thing she wanted. Still, Shouko does make an effort to befriend Karada. As they cross paths again later that night near a revered small shrine, Karada’s secret wish to grow up so she’s no longer a burden on her brother comes true. Problem is, she wasn’t quite prepared for it – kid mentality in an adult body is a combo set for trouble. Throw in the fact Shouko is converted into a young girl and things get pretty complicated fast. What ensues is an inspiring struggle of the two adjusting to this shocking turn of events with Shouko having to be the adult figure despite her physical limitations (precocious girl and then some) and Karada having to learn the ropes of being an adult on physical and emotional levels. The entire series takes place over a full summer period, aka 3 months.Now this may sound like a very serious title to you. In part, it is. But with a fairly light-hearted approach, pretty animation, a soothing coastal town setting (not too different from Kamichu!) and a very potent character cast with great depth, Living for the Day After Tomorrow is a feel-good series with some drama to give it an edge. Within the one-cour time format that J.C. Staff was given for this adaptation, director Katsushi Sakurabi gets the pacing just right, which is important for a series you expect to get resolution of the sole plot line by the end. In fact, the pacing is done so well there isn’t a wasted character or event in the show. Furthermore, each episode ends on a note that leaves something hanging in the air for next time – a good practice when you’rve got material that is more dramatic. Something important is always happening but the moods vary as required. In very recent times, the majority of series have left major plot lines unfinished or chose to completely ignore plot whatsoever. So to see this show achieve what was laid down from the first episode is quite refreshing.The character designs by Ikoku Itou (Princess Tutu, Sailor Moon S) are reasonable but not great. This is J.C. Staff after all – their production quality standards have slipped, plus in a year the first Nodame Cantabile series came out, you get the feeling this got a fairly small budget to be made. The level of detail within the animation and the background art is the one major issue with this show. A decent budget would have made it look magic. Still, it’s not that far off the mark. The animation is generally pretty, the art is relaxing, light and water effects seem accurate. It’s merely an aesthetic imperfection, which really shouldn’t be the one thing to stop you from watching this show.The soundtrack by Shinkichi Mitsumune (Revolutuionary Girl Utena, Rozen Maiden) is another of his usual orchestral efforts and is just sublime. Piano and keyboards play a very prominent role in the in-episode pieces as well as the opening and ending themes, which is appropriate since they’re very apt at instilling nostalgia and connecting with memories to enhance key moments. Thankfully piano is not always dominant – Mitsumune varies the pieces with use of the full orchestral repertoire which makes for very different pieces by merely changing timing or one instrument. It’s one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in a long time. I’d listen to a good portion of the soundtrack to this show on a regular basis. The two main female seiyuus – Ayumi Fujimura (Eiko in Squid Girl, Cecily in Sacred Blacksmith) as Karada and Shizuka Itou (Hinagiku in Hayate no Gotoku, Haruka in Amagami SS) as Shouko face an interesting challenge to switch between the child and adult versions of their characters, but they do it with such ease. Ami Koshimizu (Kallen in Code Geass, Horo in Spice and Wolf) makes yet another stellar performance with her amazingly broad vocal range as the perky, upbeat Kotomi.The lead characters, as well as the secondary, all have issues of some sort and a claim to the overall scenario. Karada is secretly unhappy with the fact Hiro only lives for her and that he doesn’t have any drive for anything else in life. Shouko is still in love and is angry Hiro seems ignorant of the fact, not to mention he hasn’t told Karada about what happened between the two of them. Hiro is a real shell of a person – the guy has good intentions but his actions let him down consistently. Testumasa (nicknamed ‘Crispy Amino), one of Karada’s friends from school, is infatuated with her and quickly becomes obsessed with finding her after the age switch. Touko, Tetsumasa’s older sister, has her hands full coping with his antics and Hiro’s brooding. Then we have Kotomi, who is somewhat a drifter and very spontaneous in her actions.But what is truly the best part of Living for the Day After Tomorrow is the story and the character chemistry dynamic that comes from all those issues. Karada and Shouko make for a great duo – they fill the missing parts the other had before they met. Karada’s optimism and drive gets Shouko out of the dumps while Shouko provides the advice and maturity Karada wishes she had. Karada’s actions later in the series may confuse some people, but ultimately she knows that Hiro must be able to live for something more than just her and seeks to find a way to make it happen. Shouko’s light venting at Hiro is just hilarious – an ex-lover in a kid’s body trying to pound the guy who left her yet can’t – priceless. Overall, Shouko is probably the biggest victim of this all, yet she is the one who always keeps a cool head, acts rationally and is able to resolve problems. Her resiliency and compassion are drawn out from her bitter surface by Karada and it is simply uplifting to see Shouko’s soul get the long overdue healing it really needed. Yet it is insanely funny seeing Shouko do it in a young body and the limitations it comes with. Kotomi acts as a great foil for Tetsumasa’s desperate longing, who realises he still has some major growing up to do. Touko is a no-nonsense woman who provides the stability and shoulder to lean on the guys need. Kotomi in general is the catalyst that draws everything together for the reality checks everyone needs to have. In the latter episodes, Kotomi’s mentor is one intriguing guy with a very unique yet refreshing approach to life and adds the finishing touches to drive home the lessons the lead characters need to learn. The leadup from the startling beginning to the heart-warming finale flows seamlessly and the plot is resolved in full. It’s rare to see a one-season series wrap everything up well – it’s very refreshing to see.Ultimately, what really gives Living for the Day After Tomorrow an edge for me is the respect it has for its characters and the maturity it approaches a very delicate scenario with. There is a light amount of fanservice but nothing inappropriate. People that need to grow up are not let off lightly, unlike certain male protagonists in recent years. Most of all, Karada’s journey could easily have been a trainwreck. For a fair while, I was worried Karada would take a path similar to Nagisa did in the latter part of the original Clannad series. But Karada’s determination to become stronger as a person and to be able to say to Hiro ‘I’m not going to be little and dependent forever, so don’t put your life on hold for me forever’ is very admirable indeed. Shouko’s gradual softening of the heart, but not of her tenacity and will, is a testament to what a strong, capable woman she is despite the hardships life has dealt her. With all the issues and the flaws this character mix have, it could have turned into an angst-filled mess in no time. But instead the story maintains an upbeat view on things and eventually, after a lot of heart-wrenching bends and some hard lessons, things are resolved in a plausible, fairly realistic way. And that is the other thing I enjoy so much about this series. The characters feel like real people and not like overused moe archetypes or invincible people that overcome any extremity with ease. The level of escapism within this show is relaxing but not a bubble blocking out what comes with life.In short, Living for the Day After Tomorrow is a rare example of a great story fulfilling everything it promised to from the start, conveying it with a very compelling cast of characters and executing it brilliantly. While the visuals may not be stellar, they don’t drag the series down. If you are in need of a feel-good story with some real bite but portrayed with maturity and goodwill, this is one series you can’t afford to miss. If you are one of the lucky few to have seen this, do let other people have the chance to see it for themselves. I only found out about this show due to a friend who lent me his DVDs. Not sporting the overused archetypes and styles of recent times is not a reason to look this show over. Give Living for the Day After Tomorrow an honest go. You may be surprised. closest to you?In the October season of 2006, after the airings of the heavily hyped Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Fate/Stay Night, J.C. Staff produced a rather intriguing series called Asatte no Houkou (Living for the Day After Tomorrow on release by Sentai), based on a manga originally created by J-ta Yamada, which explored the scenario of age changing. The story revolves around two females who have never met before but are linked in more ways than they know. Karada is a middle schooler who is rather small for her age but very likeable, one heck of a cook and very positive in her approach to anything in life, but the fact her brother, Hiro, had to return from overseas four years ago to take custody of her when her parents died, is something she’s never been able to live with. The older female is Shouko, in her late 20s, somewhat cold and empty. But there’s a good reason for that. Shouko was once Hiro’s long-time girlfriend in America, then four years ago Hiro left Shouko behind without saying why. Present day, Shouko returns to Japan in search of a new start in life. Crossing paths with Hiro and the person responsible for making him leave her life is the last thing she wanted. Still, Shouko does make an effort to befriend Karada. As they cross paths again later that night near a revered small shrine, Karada’s secret wish to grow up so she’s no longer a burden on her brother comes true. Problem is, she wasn’t quite prepared for it – kid mentality in an adult body is a combo set for trouble. Throw in the fact Shouko is converted into a young girl and things get pretty complicated fast. What ensues is an inspiring struggle of the two adjusting to this shocking turn of events with Shouko having to be the adult figure despite her physical limitations (precocious girl and then some) and Karada having to learn the ropes of being an adult on physical and emotional levels. The entire series takes place over a full summer period, aka 3 months.Now this may sound like a very serious title to you. In part, it is. But with a fairly light-hearted approach, pretty animation, a soothing coastal town setting (not too different from Kamichu!) and a very potent character cast with great depth, Living for the Day After Tomorrow is a feel-good series with some drama to give it an edge. Within the one-cour time format that J.C. Staff was given for this adaptation, director Katsushi Sakurabi gets the pacing just right, which is important for a series you expect to get resolution of the sole plot line by the end. In fact, the pacing is done so well there isn’t a wasted character or event in the show. Furthermore, each episode ends on a note that leaves something hanging in the air for next time – a good practice when you’rve got material that is more dramatic. Something important is always happening but the moods vary as required. In very recent times, the majority of series have left major plot lines unfinished or chose to completely ignore plot whatsoever. So to see this show achieve what was laid down from the first episode is quite refreshing.The character designs by Ikoku Itou (Princess Tutu, Sailor Moon S) are reasonable but not great. This is J.C. Staff after all – their production quality standards have slipped, plus in a year the first Nodame Cantabile series came out, you get the feeling this got a fairly small budget to be made. The level of detail within the animation and the background art is the one major issue with this show. A decent budget would have made it look magic. Still, it’s not that far off the mark. The animation is generally pretty, the art is relaxing, light and water effects seem accurate. It’s merely an aesthetic imperfection, which really shouldn’t be the one thing to stop you from watching this show.The soundtrack by Shinkichi Mitsumune (Revolutuionary Girl Utena, Rozen Maiden) is another of his usual orchestral efforts and is just sublime. Piano and keyboards play a very prominent role in the in-episode pieces as well as the opening and ending themes, which is appropriate since they’re very apt at instilling nostalgia and connecting with memories to enhance key moments. Thankfully piano is not always dominant – Mitsumune varies the pieces with use of the full orchestral repertoire which makes for very different pieces by merely changing timing or one instrument. It’s one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in a long time. I’d listen to a good portion of the soundtrack to this show on a regular basis. The two main female seiyuus – Ayumi Fujimura (Eiko in Squid Girl, Cecily in Sacred Blacksmith) as Karada and Shizuka Itou (Hinagiku in Hayate no Gotoku, Haruka in Amagami SS) as Shouko face an interesting challenge to switch between the child and adult versions of their characters, but they do it with such ease. Ami Koshimizu (Kallen in Code Geass, Horo in Spice and Wolf) makes yet another stellar performance with her amazingly broad vocal range as the perky, upbeat Kotomi.The lead characters, as well as the secondary, all have issues of some sort and a claim to the overall scenario. Karada is secretly unhappy with the fact Hiro only lives for her and that he doesn’t have any drive for anything else in life. Shouko is still in love and is angry Hiro seems ignorant of the fact, not to mention he hasn’t told Karada about what happened between the two of them. Hiro is a real shell of a person – the guy has good intentions but his actions let him down consistently. Testumasa (nicknamed ‘Crispy Amino), one of Karada’s friends from school, is infatuated with her and quickly becomes obsessed with finding her after the age switch. Touko, Tetsumasa’s older sister, has her hands full coping with his antics and Hiro’s brooding. Then we have Kotomi, who is somewhat a drifter and very spontaneous in her actions.But what is truly the best part of Living for the Day After Tomorrow is the story and the character chemistry dynamic that comes from all those issues. Karada and Shouko make for a great duo – they fill the missing parts the other had before they met. Karada’s optimism and drive gets Shouko out of the dumps while Shouko provides the advice and maturity Karada wishes she had. Karada’s actions later in the series may confuse some people, but ultimately she knows that Hiro must be able to live for something more than just her and seeks to find a way to make it happen. Shouko’s light venting at Hiro is just hilarious – an ex-lover in a kid’s body trying to pound the guy who left her yet can’t – priceless. Overall, Shouko is probably the biggest victim of this all, yet she is the one who always keeps a cool head, acts rationally and is able to resolve problems. Her resiliency and compassion are drawn out from her bitter surface by Karada and it is simply uplifting to see Shouko’s soul get the long overdue healing it really needed. Yet it is insanely funny seeing Shouko do it in a young body and the limitations it comes with. Kotomi acts as a great foil for Tetsumasa’s desperate longing, who realises he still has some major growing up to do. Touko is a no-nonsense woman who provides the stability and shoulder to lean on the guys need. Kotomi in general is the catalyst that draws everything together for the reality checks everyone needs to have. In the latter episodes, Kotomi’s mentor is one intriguing guy with a very unique yet refreshing approach to life and adds the finishing touches to drive home the lessons the lead characters need to learn. The leadup from the startling beginning to the heart-warming finale flows seamlessly and the plot is resolved in full. It’s rare to see a one-season series wrap everything up well – it’s very refreshing to see.Ultimately, what really gives Living for the Day After Tomorrow an edge for me is the respect it has for its characters and the maturity it approaches a very delicate scenario with. There is a light amount of fanservice but nothing inappropriate. People that need to grow up are not let off lightly, unlike certain male protagonists in recent years. Most of all, Karada’s journey could easily have been a trainwreck. For a fair while, I was worried Karada would take a path similar to Nagisa did in the latter part of the original Clannad series. But Karada’s determination to become stronger as a person and to be able to say to Hiro ‘I’m not going to be little and dependent forever, so don’t put your life on hold for me forever’ is very admirable indeed. Shouko’s gradual softening of the heart, but not of her tenacity and will, is a testament to what a strong, capable woman she is despite the hardships life has dealt her. With all the issues and the flaws this character mix have, it could have turned into an angst-filled mess in no time. But instead the story maintains an upbeat view on things and eventually, after a lot of heart-wrenching bends and some hard lessons, things are resolved in a plausible, fairly realistic way. And that is the other thing I enjoy so much about this series. The characters feel like real people and not like overused moe archetypes or invincible people that overcome any extremity with ease. The level of escapism within this show is relaxing but not a bubble blocking out what comes with life.In short, Living for the Day After Tomorrow is a rare example of a great story fulfilling everything it promised to from the start, conveying it with a very compelling cast of characters and executing it brilliantly.

You may be surprised.', ""The ending came a bit sudden. I would've liked to see the transformation again, and possibly a scene between Hiro and Shouko that wasn't so sped up. But all in all, the whole anime was symbolism to just love who you are and be careful what you wish for. Plus, it's refreshing to hear Satoshi Hino's voice. I enjoyed watching it, and I liked the short amount of episodes. And Tetsu-Kun was adorable, and though he's only twelve, he already seems to have it all figured out! He's really a great character for the story. Not to mention the way they displayed the background between...each character was done perfectly.

For all the crying about 'melodrama', here we have drama done right and it's likely been forgotten by most  (fuck you).Say what you will about the plot, the execution is tasteful with a mature sensibility. The pacing is slow and moves naturally, which makes for a relaxing watch. The pace also supplements the drama, creating tension as we wait for the characters to react to what happens around them. These characters don't start off as complete systems, but as fragmented individuals that we...learn about over the run-time of the anime and through their actions on-screen. As such, their reactions to events are unpredictable and realistic. You begin to care about these characters, not because the writers want us to, but because they naturally attract our sympathy by acting so natural. The events themselves aren't soul-shattering, in fact despite the supernatural aspect, the problems the characters face are pretty mundane. This makes what happens believable and perhaps, even relatable. Don't expect to see any shouting matches or tense stand-offs because the emotional action is really subdued. This doesn't allow for any annoyances to spring up (like a character making a ridiculous leap in logic and running away in tears). There is running away but it happens so fast that it's not cheesy and doesn't feel unnecessary. The story flows so naturally that it seems as if the writers lost control at some point, and the characters are moving things of their own momentum.Emotions and character motivations (even if they may be shallow) are revealed to us in subtle hints such as body language.

There is no need for stream-of-consciousness-esque voice-overs, and a 'you just saw this three seconds ago' flashback is actually utilized effectively. Expect some melancholic out-loud to oneself one-liners (they're actually good). Any good script would be made better with 10% of the dialogue removed. This one only needs a couple of lines trimmed here and there. If the writing is bad, it is obscured by the execution and direction. So, even when something a little too coincidental happens, you don't feel like yelling at the screen because it's actually unexpected. The ending is inoffensive, so no worries there.The director would go on to do Flying Witch, makes sense.

Loli-Shouko is cute too. It's interesting to note how when the characters change their appearances it seems to us that their personalities change as well. However, looking back, this actually isn't the case. Whether purposefully done or not, this anime makes you realize how susceptible you are to appearances. No character really stands out, but that may be because they aren't operating on gimmicks. As the characters progress through the series little milestones are made with one another, important experiences that grow their relationships. Don't expect these to be spelled out for you, because you might miss them. Perhaps the most subtle character development I've ever seen.In short this a subtle, comfy drama, with a little bit of romance elements, that will completely assimilate you for 12 episodes.

The anime does try comedy one or two times, and fails spectacularly at it. However, as mentioned, comedy is not the point.If there is something that the show definitely pulls off right is pacing. It knows how to be patient and let things happen once understand the scale of the impact it may have on the characters. Everything that happens, even the stuff that lead nowhere, go nowhere or where obvious from way before, all bear some weight (a lot of the times, a pretty heavy weight) and...it can definitely get to you in a good sense.

It´s a near-perfect compliment to the concise plot which escalates rather organically and whose flashback positioning felt absolutely precise.However, I did say ""near-perfect"". The main cast has a deep issue of being irrealistically centric upon itself, isolating the characters from any form of goals or thoughts beyond those pertaining to either the plot or the other characters. No character suffers from this more than Shouko, in my opinion, and it can be really forceful to give sympathy for her until later in the show, which slightly strengthening her character arc, takes away an important part of enjoyment from the early parts of the anime.Moreover, the characters tend to overreact to pretty much everything, and nobody seems to ever keep an eye on anyone else except when it´s plot-convenient.

Both of these characters - Karada, the girl turned adult, and Shouko, the woman turned child - seem to be happy enough, until they learn that the man in both of their lives, the older brother of Karada and ex-boyfriend to Shouko, Hiro, has something to do with the other. Cue the inciting incident - Shouko turns out to not be so mature of an adult and, despite knowing Karada hates being seen as a child more than anything, hurts her out of spite, which leads to her storming off and both of them getting transformed by the wish stone they happen to meet in front of. It happened because both of them are flawed as people which has to do with their own past trauma, and it seems that the next step is them helping each other out!Shouko, still spiteful but seeing Karada in an adult body for the lost child she is, invites her to her own place, aware that she has nowhere else to go, and does her best to be as rational about the situation as possible.

Starting with Hiro, the brother who was unwittingly at the center of the inciting incident without realizing, who is an unbelievably boring third main character. He left his girlfriend in order to take care of his sister after her parents died, but he has very little personality to go along with it. He is more or less just pushed into situations by everyone else.

He extends his disbelief enough to support the two girls in his life, and that's it. Sure, he sacrificed his ambitions in life to take care of a child in need because he felt it was the right thing to do, but that honestly seems more like a way to drive the plot forward by creating conflict instead of it really having to do with him. And then... the story just loses its focus.Whereas Shouko immediately caught on to the fact that the little girl her ex-boyfriend never told her about during their relationship was the reason fir their breakup, Karada only realizes much later and it comes as a shock to her. Her guilt of knowing her brother left his girlfriend to take care of her eats her up and makes her run away. And while some scenes are really well-handled, like Karada slowly learning about functioning as an adult, what is needed to get a job, an apartment, in the end she just wanders into a really friendly pension who just take her as is and that was that. A friend from her school looks for her for several episodes which ends up with them falling in love, and that's that. All the while Shouko's trauma is addressed very briefly (like her remembering that she was too shy to join other children for playing together) and it starts to feel more like an accident that she got transformed rather than an honest-to-god wish she had from the bottom of her heart due to her past. Sure, it leads to the reveal that Karada's brother was literally her everything in life, her first friend, her best friend and that's why she felt so possessive over him, acting in a way very befitting of an immature adult with lacking socialization, but it's all basically just thrown into the show in 5 minutes of dialogue at the very end rather than waving it into the story to go with the narrative. Same goes for the final moment, during which, after accepting their past and settling into their new lives, the characters are turned back to how they were without any of them having anything of meaning to say about the whole thing. It just felt very rushed and seeing that the manga was still ongoing when the anime concluded, I believe that is where the problem lies; the anime team struggling to connect the initial setup of the manga into an anime that was still supposed to have a definite ending rather than ending openly, inconclusively.However, despite all that incohesion upon further inspection, the show manages to overall be charming and soothing.

The summer imagery is beautifully paced, giving the scenery and every mood room to breathe, and I could feel it to my core (in part due to the fact that I was watching this show during the height of summer 2022). I think it's a show worth watching. It just unfortunately doesn't follow through on its initial thematic throughline and more so just turns into a summer romance kind of deal. But then, don't we all have at least one childhood summer in fond memory?""]"
Azur Lane: Bisoku Zenshin!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40930/Azur_Lane__Bisoku_Zenshin,"['""Fine, I\'ll do it myself."" — Yostar, probably.The first adaptation of Azur Lane was a disaster. Poor pacing, inconsistent animation quality, bad writing reducing a major faction (Ironblood) to a minor role...gacha adaptations aren\'t known for their quality, but that didn\'t stop Azur Lane from sinking in the Sea of Disappoinments. So, what does Bisoku Zenshin do to avoid the same fate?Fluff. Loads upon loads of fluff.Where the first adaptation struggled to find a balance between action and comedy, Bisoku Zenshin doubles down on lightheartedness. Each episode follows Starter Squad on their adventures around home port, encountering other shipgirls along the way while partaking in...wholesome activities. Sleepovers, amusement parks, chocolate making, open-aired baths...there is no identity crisis to be found here, Bisoku Zenshin knows it\'s Slice of Life and delivers in full. Now, does this mean that punchlines will have you laughing into next week? Probably not, but the formulaic routine is enough to keep viewers entertained without throwing them for a loop.The production quality of Bisoku Zenshin is an interesting conundrum. Animated by the newly formed Yostar Pictures alongside CANDY BOX, Bisoku Zenshin\'s animation quality can best be described as less impressive, but far more consistent than its predecessor. Warm colors, cute facial expressions, lewd close-ups...it\'s about what you would expect from a Slice of Life, but a few shots (best seen through character stiches) offer a glimpse into what a more refined production pipeline could create once YP gains more experience. As it is, Bisoku Zenshin doesn\'t do much to impress visually (especially with only an 8 1/2 minute runtime, 6 1/2 minutes if you exclude the ED), but avoiding the issues of its predecessor by starting from scratch and setting the bar low is a reassuring sign for the future. It\'s even in the name: Bisoku Zenshin, ""Slow Ahead""!The characters of Azur Lane are its bread and butter. Where Bisoku Zenshin triumphs here is in broadly characterizing a larger amount of shipgirls than its predecssor while treating Ironblood as it is: A major faction. To put this into perspective, Niimi / Z23 was only given ~3 minutes of screentime in the original adaptation, whereas here she\'s a main character. Frankly, it boggles my mind how the first adaptation failed at proper faction representation (it didn\'t even include cameos from minor factions; Bisoku Zenshin does) so to see proper representation now is a relief. As for the broad characterization, it\'s just that: Broad. Think of it like being introduced to some potential waifu candidates every episode, except that you actually get an idea for their personality instead of being stuck with a brooding, OOC Enterprise for 12 episodes. The character diversity each episode brings is refreshing, and it\'s unlikely you\'ll go through the entire cour without finding at least one shipgirl you like.What else? Sound quality is nothing special (some cute tracks here and there; OP and ED are nothing special), voice acting is authentic (same VAs as the game), storyboards use the manga as a base and splice chapters / add new content without an issue...that\'s about it. Bisoku Zenshin doesn\'t stray from the pack; its key goal is fanservice above all else. Does that mean it\'s bad? Far from it, especially when compared to its dumpster fire of a predecessor. It\'s simply a decent, niche title that will satisfy Azur Lane\'s playerbase and pull in an anime-only or two with its wholesome moments and diverse cast.

Slow Ahead manga, and now anime, focus on those ""important"" parts, which is SoL, comedy and fanservice.Natural consequence of being a fanservice (in broader meaning, not just sexual) for players of already fanservice focused game, on top of being a short adaptation of 4-koma manga, is that it doesn\'t explain anything about the world or characters. This...anime is aimed at people who already know shipgirls. While I\'d love it to bring more players to the game, I can\'t really recommend starting with it if you had no contact with the Azur Lane universe before.With that out of the way, what can I say about this title? For one, it\'s actually good. Jokes are funny for the most part and fanservice - be it sexual or just game references - is right on spot. While it could get way more ecchi, I’m ok with the level we got served here.I\'m obviously biased, but characters are the strongest point here, as you\'d expect from this kind of anime. Their design, voice acting and quirks are all good and also represent their game counterparts properly.Art, and especially sound, aren\'t anything special. Just simple and cute.In the end, Azur Lane: Bisoku Zenshin is one of those titles that are there simply for promotion, without even trying to seem like a standalone anime.

These are basically ecchi fan service shorts. However, what makes this stand out compared to the main series is that it leaves out all the drama and action while effectively showcasing the very thing that makes Azur Lane so appealing in the first place: its cute girls.The series boasts itself an ensemble of likable, well-designed characters which is obviously the biggest draw. All the girls are undeniably cute and very attractive. Their personalities, though admittedly catered towards the male demographic, are kind of charming as they work well in a non-hostile environment...and that in my opinion is what makes this short little series such a pleasant watch. I would even say it's vastly superior to the main show itself in that there's no action, no jarring CG, no high octane moments or ridiculous plots. It's just a pure slice of life as you primarily follow the group of Laffey, Javelin, Ayanami, and Z23 going about their daily routine interacting with the other characters of the show and learning more about them in a more lighthearted and friendly way. Cooking, cleaning, relaxing, bathing, just having fun...it’s all here. Sure there’s nothing amazing with the animation or the story but it’s serviceable for what it is and doesn’t try to cram in too much.Perhaps you had some mixed feelings towards the main show itself but still liked the characters and their designs and just wanted to see them doing cute things. If this sounds like you, give this a try. It's short but sweet and if that's what you seek in your anime, you can’t really go wrong with this one. Of course, this is moreso for people already familiar with the series so it's best to have some knowledge of it.

I'd say the staff did a very good job at bringing the shipgirls to life.Also It's great that the series takes note from the game itself, you have characters that act here like the same way they act in the game and even develop from there.Anyway would I recommend this show for everyone? No, unless you're knowledgable enough about azur lane you won't really enjoy this show, it's kinda like the holo no graffiti from hololive, where you won't understand what's happening unless you have sufficient enough background knowledge tocomprehend it.Still though if you've played Azur lane then you can give this a try, overall score for me is a 7 the game is lewd as such this anime doesn't shy away from it.

Nothing more needs to be said really apart from it brings our 4 starter destroyers together the whole way through.The art is really nice quality and honestly, I could say is better quality than the main show in this art form.The opening...a simple set of our girls saying the title is perfect.

META ships don’t farm themselves.While not necessarily a continuation of the actual Azur lane anime (though you could kind of bend it to be one), Slow Ahead! again follows our four destroyers from the four main fleets in the series: IJN Ayanami, USS Laffey, HMS Javelin, and KMS Z-23, or Niimi for short. Together, the four destroyers experience life around the naval base, interacting with various ships from each of the four fleets in a slice of life...experience that’s objectively more lewd than daily life really should be.And that’s really it. Look, the show’s only about six minutes a pop and based on a 4-koma manga, so there really isn’t a lot to go off of here. Oddly enough though, I would consider this a somehow better example of the Azur Lane story because every short is contained, straightforward, and actually quite lax. There’s not much else to talk about since all we have are slice of life romps, although the situations vary heavily from hunting in the woods to doing some spring cleaning, all the way to finding out which of the several dozen girls featured in the show have the best ‘pillows’ to sleep on. Yes that is an episode plot; don’t think about it too hard.That being said, this kind of story is predominantly why I think it works so well for Azur Lane specifically and why I would consider it to be a ‘better adaptation’ for fans or newcomers. The game currently has 521 ships at the time of writing this. What Slow Ahead! does is take a small handful of the more popular ships and themes one of the episodes around them to create the self contained story. Rarely does the show ever focus on more than two ships from the plethora pool of many aside from the destroyer quartet, so the show doesn’t end up feeling bloated or anything because before, left right and center had a character from the game that we just don’t get the name to because there’s not enough time in the show to explain who or what they are.And since Yostar has their own animation studio now, much of what we got in terms of animation quality at least looks and feels the part to make it seem like ‘Azur Lane’. The artystyle is certainly more bubbly than I was expecting, and there were a lot more physics and…shot decisions than I would’ve liked, but considering this is a game that has bar none one of the most expansive cosmetics selections to choose from, so much so that they practically give skins away in certain events, I really should not be surprised. I will say that the inclusion of certain skins from the game (and oddly enough game mechanics?) was a welcome treat because it really shows that the showrunners cared enough to do a good enough job with advertising their game in addition to making it admittedly kind of a fun watch.Which leads me to calling this a fun watch if nothing else. The show in total is only a little over an hour to watch the whole thing, and for Azur Lane fans, this show is a more rewarding watch than the original adaptation that was attempted before. Though certainly not something that’s stellar by any means, it is entertaining nonetheless. Admittedly I would’ve preferred the show to at least have a little bit of dignity with who they chose to showcase and in what fashion to showcase them in, but after playing this game for about three years, I really should’ve expected this and it was stupid of me to think this could’ve gone any other direction. Oh well. At least I got to see Shokaku and Zuikaku talk to each other again; always a fan of watching voice actors just talking to themselves. experience that’s objectively more lewd than daily life really should be.And that’s really it. Look, the show’s only about six minutes a pop and based on a 4-koma manga, so there really isn’t a lot to go off of here. Oddly enough though, I would consider this a somehow better example of the Azur Lane story because every short is contained, straightforward, and actually quite lax. There’s not much else to talk about since all we have are slice of life romps, although the situations vary heavily from hunting in the woods to doing some spring cleaning, all the way to finding out which of the several dozen girls featured in the show have the best ‘pillows’ to sleep on. Yes that is an episode plot; don’t think about it too hard.That being said, this kind of story is predominantly why I think it works so well for Azur Lane specifically and why I would consider it to be a ‘better adaptation’ for fans or newcomers. The game currently has 521 ships at the time of writing this. What Slow Ahead! does is take a small handful of the more popular ships and themes one of the episodes around them to create the self contained story. Rarely does the show ever focus on more than two ships from the plethora pool of many aside from the destroyer quartet, so the show doesn’t end up feeling bloated or anything because before, left right and center had a character from the game that we just don’t get the name to because there’s not enough time in the show to explain who or what they are.And since Yostar has their own animation studio now, much of what we got in terms of animation quality at least looks and feels the part to make it seem like ‘Azur Lane’. The artystyle is certainly more bubbly than I was expecting, and there were a lot more physics and…shot decisions than I would’ve liked, but considering this is a game that has bar none one of the most expansive cosmetics selections to choose from, so much so that they practically give skins away in certain events, I really should not be surprised. I will say that the inclusion of certain skins from the game (and oddly enough game mechanics?) was a welcome treat because it really shows that the showrunners cared enough to do a good enough job with advertising their game in addition to making it admittedly kind of a fun watch.Which leads me to calling this a fun watch if nothing else. The show in total is only a little over an hour to watch the whole thing, and for Azur Lane fans, this show is a more rewarding watch than the original adaptation that was attempted before. Though certainly not something that’s stellar by any means, it is entertaining nonetheless. Admittedly I would’ve preferred the show to at least have a little bit of dignity with who they chose to showcase and in what fashion to showcase them in, but after playing this game for about three years, I really should’ve expected this and it was stupid of me to think this could’ve gone any other direction.

It's not that any of these features are bad, but I personally thought that the quality of most aspects of Bisoku Zeshin were just good (7/10 for Story, Art, Sound).But those aren't normally the main incentives for watching a cute girls doing cute things, slice of life anime. The main reason...I tend to enjoy these types of series has to do with the cuteness of the girls, and I thought Bisoku Zenshin did a fine job with that. This series focused mainly on the four starter ships (Niimi, Ayanami, Javelin, and Laffey), and followed them around as they interacted with some of the other ships. These interactions were all fairly amusing and showcased the cute side of these ships. There were a few cases where some of the names of the ships were brief and hard to remember, but for the most part each of the side character ships were given enough time to make them memorable (8/10 for Characters).I personally thought that Bisoku Zenshin succeeded in the places where the other Azur Lane anime and the KanColle anime failed. Both of those other series had two major problems in my books. The first problem was with the scale. Both of those series tried to introduce way too many characters, which made most of them hard to remember. Bisoku Zenshin only had a handful of characters in the series, so this wasn't as much of a problem. The other issue with the other series was the relationship between their story and the series goal. In the end, all three of these series are trying to get more people interested in the game. But the other series got tied up trying to have some grand, action-based story line, and that kind of diluted the ability for the series to spend time on the cute aspects of shipgirls. Without the dilution from a storyline, this series was really effective as a promotional series for Azur Lane (which is why I am now addicted to the game).In conclusion, I think that the quality of this series was good. It wasn't anything stellar, but I felt like it was well worth the time each week (even prior to starting the game). So as long as you are a fan of cute stuff I'm fairly sure you'd enjoy this series. (7/10 for Overall).That said, I enjoyed this show a lot more than I expected. I've always been a CGDCT fan, and I really enjoyed seeing all the interactions between these shipgirls. For my personal enjoyment, this series was perfect (10/10 for Enjoyment).

Let\'s look at the categories and why I chose what I did.Story: 10/10. The best thing about Azur Lane: Bisoku Zenshin! is it has NO story. The best story is no story in a short series like this. With each episode being about 8ish minutes long, there\'s nothing better than not having to worry about a story and the plotlines. Each episode is its own story, and that brings its own charm, by including different characters each episode, aside from our 4 main girls, Laffey, Ayanami, Javelin and Z23 (Niimi-chan). It...shows all the factions hanging out and having a good time, just like it should be. No wars, no battles, no hatred and animosity amongst them. Just friends, sleepovers, videogames and struggles with schoolwork.Art: 9/10. This could easily be a 10/10 with how good the artwork has been done in terms of adapting it from the game to an anime standpoint. I only made it a 9/10 because I felt in some places their cheeks were just a little too rosey-shiny but that\'s not a huge issue. Some coloring looked a little off in some places as well but that may have just been from my eyes binging the entire series without a break. Either way, a 9 or 10 is a good fit for the artwork. It\'s got smooth animation and great voice acting. It\'s not written in a cringy way at all, like it\'s predecessor, nor is the artwork clunky with an unfinished feeling to it.Sound: 8/10. I didn\'t have any issues with the soundtrack or music they used for the show. It was quite fitting but me being my biased self, I would have liked at least a mini intro clip aside from the ""Azur Lane: Bisoku Zenshin!"" It\'s nice because it jumps right into the show, and it\'s expected to be absent because each episode is different. Intros usually show a preview of what to expect during the series as a whole, and while this is entirely of shorts, I can understand not having an intro clip. Doesn\'t mean I\'m not a little bummed out about it but it is what it is.Character: 9/10. The only reason this isn\'t a 10/10 is because while I like the character diversity and the focus on the main 4 destroyer girls, I\'m a little bummed at the lack of focus on other characters who are very prevalent to the game itself. While this isn\'t an adaptation of the game, I personally would have liked some more inclusion of other characters like Akagi, Kaga, Hood, and San Diego, but I\'m glad to see Taihou, Rodney and Honolulu got some attention, so I suppose it evens out. Giving focus to characters who are traditionally second-focus and only noticed during events in the game, like Baltimore, Formidable and Bismarck, was surprising and very refreshing. Character development isn\'t an issue here because the show is set with the characters already being developed as they are, and instead focuses on their daily adventures. And that\'s totally fine. I wouldn\'t want to see any attempt at major character development in a short like this. The closest thing we get to development is with Ayanami, and if you watch the show, you\'ll know exactly what I mean by this.Enjoyment: 10/10. It\'s very hard to not smile and laugh out loud while watching this show. The antics, the art, the writing. Everything about it brings a smile to your face. Whether it be from Ayanami being a slouch, Niimi-chan for scolding her, Laffey falling asleep everywhere or Javelin being a klutz, you can really see the personalities of the characters in each episode. Despite some being present for only a minute or two, like Graf Spee, it\'s still heartwarming when you see them interact with each other and talk about being friends instead of enemies. The show is an absolute delight to watch, and with each episode being 8 minutes, it\'s very easy to get through. Though it may leave you wanting more, but that\'s what the manga is for!Overall: 9/10. The show is a fantastic little spin-off from the game showing how things are when there\'s no threat of Sirens blowing the ports up. The characters all have personality, they interact with each other in the exact way you\'d expect them to based off that personality and they\'re all friendly with each other, despite being enemies in the past. It\'s just an all-around enjoyable show. You\'ll laugh and shake your head and feel slightly fuzzy inside at how close of friends all the characters are. So go ahead and watch an episode or two. If you have time to watch a normal 20ish minute long episode of one show, you\'ve got the time to watch two episodes of this wonderfully goofy show. shows all the factions hanging out and having a good time, just like it should be.

Just CGDCT.I mean sure, warships. But AL isn't about that, it's about the fanservice and just collecting cute girls who are loosely warships. The story in the game, in a series of events, is already FAR FAR BETTER than the disaster that is Biburylane. The in-game storyline makes a lot more sense from a lore standpoint.Bisoku Zenshin isn't that though, it's just the main starters (including Nimi/Z23, YEY) exploring the port. If this was the Biburylane story, I'd be totally okay with it. Although, the OP for that anime is pretty good not...gonna lie.Go watch this instead of the Biburylane. The story of that anime is non-canon anyway.OVERALL RATING: 8.00/10 gonna lie.Go watch this instead of the Biburylane.

Story isn't something you would find here since this short anime is based on 4-komas manga. As such, story isn't a major contributing factor. For Yostar Picture's first project, this one is very good. They tried to closely follow the manga's artstyle which is welcomed. Animations are fluid in most cases, some oddity here and there but overall is fine. I was not that fond of the opening in the beginning but I guess it started to grow on me. Of course the main selling point of spin-offs like these are the characters. I really like the Azur...Lane's shipgirls personality. I think this would be a series you would enjoy if you are familiar with the characters, it will become so much better. I am hoping for a season 2, haha. Lane's shipgirls personality.

Nevertheless, It became one of my favorite anime, so I went and started reading the manga. When I found out season 3 was announced I was so excited because what we've seen animated so far (The first 4 episodes) are one of my favorite parts of the manga.But the anime disappointed me, a lot. They took out many scenes, memorable moments and things I thought were important to understand certain characters better. (I specially noticed this with Mephisto).Now I'm aware they changed the animation studios. I...normally wouldn't have issues with this. But I can't help but notice that character's faces keep changing. It's like they can't keep a consistent face.Non-manga readers might misinterpret character's motives. But they might still enjoy the story if they have enjoyed previous seasons. Manga readers: lower your expectations. normally wouldn't have issues with this.

I know they're meant to be teenagers confused with their feelings and relationships, but it strikes me so much that in the heat of battle they're always so worried about how they and everyone feels and judges them that they forget basic survival instincts. Like rin being digested by a zombie and having flashbacks man what should I do what should I do, like dude, kill the thing that's literally digesting you. (This was definitely done to make what feels like a genuinely small and closedminded plot not be completely obliterated in two episodes by rin actually using his powers...effectively.)

Things just seem so weird for certain characters too, it's hard to explain.

It's just it looks a little lifeless now, compared to the other seasons. It had a really unique artstyle which kinda grew on me, and as it seems onto a lot of other fans as well. But in quality it improved a lot so it would feel literally ungrateful to complain.The characters...are still lovable, beautifully designed and have their own unique personalities. This is the thing that made the series my comfort anime. That the characters are human, they feel, they struggle and they progress.

First, the overall rating of the series. How can it be that this season receives such a catastrophic rating, knowing that other, much worse anime receive a much higher rating(I'm not aiming at any anime, except perhaps the one with 7.55 for this season). What are the fans doing, seriously?Animation: 6AD: 8Nevertheless, despite my disappointment on this point, I do understand the rating, which allows me to move on to my 2nd complaint: Voln's animation....It's true that this is by far the biggest flaw of this season. The animation was nowhere near the level of previous seasons. However, in view of the excellent announcement of a 2nd court, I'm totally confident that Voln, with a little more afford and time, will be able to prepare something even more qualitative for the arcs that follow.Music: 10Va: 9.5Story: 9Characters: 10I'll end my review, however, with the many qualities of the anime, which enabled me, like many others, to be drawn into this 3 season. As for the obvious, the music, as well as the VA, were simply breathtaking. I'd even go so far as to say that this one surpassed the previous ones on all counts.Story: 9Characters: 10But it's not just that that I think this season was a success. I could talk about it for hours, but the biggest strength of Blue Exorcist, but more particularly of this arc, is very clearly the character development, as well as the world building, which is simply incredibly well done. And on this point, despite a few cuts here and there, we must applaud Voln for the work and care they've put into it.The 2nd court will focus on many of the points that make this manga my top 1. This season, which will stop just before the Blue Night investigation arc, will allow us to see the main players in the rest of the story. The six-year wait is rewarded with the sequel, scheduled for autumn 2024. Only 4 months to go.Looking forward to seeing Blue Exorcist again, and in the best possible form.

I wished they copied a-1 designs.HOPING TO SEE MORE SUPPORT THIS UNDERDOG OF A SHOW!', 'After I finished watching the third season, of my second most favorite series I ever watching, it was entertaining and a lot of things have happening, maybe because I am ao no exorcist fan or it is that I enjoy the series a lot? And I can understand why it got low rating than other seasons, maybe because they changes of another studio or maybe storyline wasn’t that hyped or interesting for anyone, but one thing they actually did, is that they following the manga and not adding fillers episodes in as they did in the first season, which is amazing things, and yes I...know they remove some scenes from the manga, but they still make equal in anime series as the manga series is, and animation was amazing made, I’ve I can understand some people didn’t like it and also a little bit of 3D scene in the series, but I don’t see any problem with it, I am still enjoying the series as it was, as a Ao no exorcist fan, the season three was enjoyable and have amazing moments in it, and for those who are not fan of the series, I hope you like the series somehow, in the end I did enjoy the third season of Ao no exorcist series and I am looking forward to next season of Ao no exorcist!Thank you! know they remove some scenes from the manga, but they still make equal in anime series as the manga series is, and animation was amazing made, I’ve I can understand some people didn’t like it and also a little bit of 3D scene in the series, but I don’t see any problem with it, I am still enjoying the series as it was, as a Ao no exorcist fan, the season three was enjoyable and have amazing moments in it, and for those who are not fan of the series, I hope you like the series somehow, in the end I did enjoy the third season of Ao no exorcist series and I am looking forward to next season of Ao no exorcist!Thank you!', 'Blue Exorcist was one of my favourite animes when the first season came out, so much so I immediately started collecting the manga - which I haven\'t read so my review is based soley on the anime. I can also safely say I am not blinded by nostalgia as I rewatched all the (canon) media prior to starting s3 - that really set the tone for what I was about to experience.Season 3 perfectly encapsulates everything there is that is wrong with this anime: boring exposition, confusing character motivations, eye rolling amounts of twists, reliance on shock factor and trying to 1-up the last...deception in order to keep things interesting. All of these are ever present throughout the 12 episodes. A lot of my problems are very specific, but for the sake of keeping this spoiler free I\'m going to talk very vaguely - so my apologies if this is confusing.Starting with what annoyed me the most; the plot twists. There\'s around five of them which all happen fairly early on - 2 of them are excusable and contribute positively to the story as they make sense and have been foreshadowed in the prior seasons. The others however seem to only exist to add shock value and provide the characters with something to do. Not only are there far too many of them but they just make no sense, there\'s no build up or hints as to what the twist is - they just happen completely out of nowhere? To avoid spoilers I\'m not going to break these down but oh boy are these revelations handled poorly and significantly degrade the quality as there affects continue to disrupt the following episodes.Exposition dumps is another feature that, to this seasons credit, isn\'t used all that frequently - there was just one particular episode that was entirely and exposition dump that irked me the most. It piled 1 characters entire backstory and motivations into 20 minutes, then expected me to care for them? The way it was done was incredibly poor and did absolutely nothing, I did not empathise or feel anything in particular as the way the information was delivered seemed much to like it was telling me how to feel. ""Here\'s this poor character, look at their misfortune, isn\'t it so sad? are you feeling sad yet?"" Overdone.Through trying to develop characters, this season just butchers them instead. Each character is given something to work with, but every time it just falls flat. By the end of the season there\'s practically no difference as to how they were at the start - with one exception of differing character relations. Their motivations for their actions made absolutely no sense to me, they just seem like completely different people - or at least watered down versions of how they were in previous seasons. They have barely any actual depth, despite the things they go through that very so should affect them! They act no different and their morals are just up in the air, who knows what they value because they seem to change it every episode.Rin\'s character is one I have a very big problem with as well. Having the main character also be the comic relief can work - if handled with care. As you can probably tell by now, Rin is not. I understand that this is a shonen, and me being very much not the demographic I might be expecting too much, but there are plenty of other shonens out there that explore deep themes whilst also balancing light hearted scenes to even out the tension. Season 3 bats you around like a tennis ball with no regard for subtlety or care. One second Rin will be battling with what it means to be half-demon then the next he\'ll just crack an immature joke. I understand that comedy is his way of coping - that\'s what I love about his character, he prioritises everyone else\'s comfort above his own and is such a kind and loving guy who cherishes friends, and he\'s also literally just a kid who has been through so much trauma...but it\'s just not handled well. The tonal shifts are like a slap in the face, I don\'t know whether I\'m supposed to be feeling tense during the tense moments when a stupid joke that is about to ruin everything is hovering just a few seconds away. It really ruins a lot of pivotal moments.Technically that is a separate point I got a bit carried away with, but it\'s most prevalent through Rin\'s character - but the tone of the anime is another downside. On paper it very much seems like they\'re going for a more serious feel with strong themes of generational trauma and familial betrayal, but the fail to ever stick to this. The strong moments are undermined by comedic jokes right after, with no breathing room to let whatever big impactful event sink in. I also think the stakes are non-existent this season, there just isn\'t an overwhelming threat that feels like it\'s actually going to cause an real significant long lasting damage.In terms of animation, it\'s all been said before. I agree with the majority that the anatomy on the new artstyle makes a lot of the characters look off. but the colouring is gorgeous and somebody really loves Bon because he looked so fine in practically every scene he was in. Bon stans ate.The sound didn\'t stand out to me at all, the op and ed are fine nothing special. The effects and background tracks do feel a little corny in places but are unremarkable at best. Voice performances are also fine, on par with the previous seasons and again, nothing special.Overall I\'m incredibly disappointed with what we got, it feels rushed which is incredibly sad considering just how long we had to wait for this. I\'m definitely going to go read the manga now because it feels like a lot was left out/underdeveloped, and I really do love this series so I don\'t want to leave it like this. deception in order to keep things interesting.

The animation never disappointed me, even after the change of animators.  Now I know that they left out a lot of manga content in the anime, but realistically, this was to be expected.

The previous seasons and the movie are generic in a lot of ways but entertaining enough to keep watching, this season however is pathetc.First I will get the obvious out of the way and acknowledge the undeniable drop in animation quality, but beyond that the story and characters become incomprehensibly bad. The most succint way I can describe this without giving specifc spoilers is that there is a character whose allegiance is all over the place, they are double agents, no wait, they are triple agents, no wait, they are back to double agents, no...wait, they are now openly loyal to one side oh wait, no they aren\'t.This is already handled extremely poorly and it is made a million times worse by the fact that it is effectively never addressed, all parties involved in this season are aware of this characters constant back stabbing and fickle ""loyalty""  yet for some reason never do anything about it and every single other character in the show allows this character to freely walk around their base and interact with them like they are good friends and they hadn\'t fought tooth and nail trying to help a depraved, perverted ""scientist"" do horrific experiments on children. It is so painfully stupid, having a traitor could have easily been a great angle to take but the way it is handled here with nobody caring about the perpetual betrayals, nobody treating the person any different, none of their actions having any consequences means it is all utterl pointless, none of it goes anywhere, has any weight or significance to it, it is the most anticlimactic way to incorporate a ""twist"" humanly possible.Lastly, again without spoiling anything, as you know from the synposis there is another powerful organization that comes into play at this point in the story, this factions motivations make literally no sense whatsoever, every single sentence out of the leaders mouth directly contradicts who they are as a being and the way the operation is being ran and who make up the entirety of the organizations ranks also directy contradicts the goal they claim to be striving for, along with directly contradicting the claimed motiviatins of the above mentioned traitor, making their character arc even more idiotic.I finished this season out of curiosity and read a little bit of what comes next in the story and jesus wept somehow the impossible happens and it gets worse and dumber beyond this point, like I said despite being relatively generic I liked the show before this point but this season and the ""story"" that lies beyond have some of the worst writing ever seen, you could not pay me to sit through that. wait, they are now openly loyal to one side oh wait, no they aren\'t.This is already handled extremely poorly and it is made a million times worse by the fact that it is effectively never addressed, all parties involved in this season are aware of this characters constant back stabbing and fickle ""loyalty""  yet for some reason never do anything about it and every single other character in the show allows this character to freely walk around their base and interact with them like they are good friends and they hadn\'t fought tooth and nail trying to help a depraved, perverted ""scientist"" do horrific experiments on children.

The whole issue of the Illuminatis, due to the conception that one has of conspiracy theories, imagines that it will be a very dangerous organization on a global scale in collusion with governments. Unfortunately, at least in this season, the macro ended up being something micro. The entire confrontation takes place in a small facility in some small city in Japan. Thanks to the small magnitude, the true danger of this new organization cannot be measured.The best thing...anime does are the emotional moments. Even if they are template stories that we have already seen in other works, the way they tell these stories is what makes you end up generating empathy towards them, whether they are allies or enemies. Personally, the best thing this season has are Izumo and Shima, both characters who receive development in a certain way and at the end of the season they can make a jump on your list of favorite characters in the work. The storytelling that the work has is very well worked and knows how to fit the pieces of the puzzle that is the main story.On the other hand, in the negative I feel that it is the action. This part of the story feels like one of transition. Which is not what one as a viewer was expecting to see after 7 years of waiting. The fights were very few, I think we had one in the entire season. At the climax of the conflict it is felt that some fights were needed, either to see how the characters have evolved, or at least to do a job of refreshing people's memory about the fighting style of each of the protagonist circle. Outside of Rin's blue flames, the rest of the characters do not have a defined fighting style that makes you remember them over time. There is also the issue that we have just been introduced to a new organization, outside of its leader, it needs to show how strong its members are to support that they can carry out their ideals.Let's imagine for a moment that we didn't watch the second season before the third aired to arrive with a fresh memory. This third season wants to trick you into thinking that the second season was released last year. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and the 7 years that exist between seasons work against it when it comes to giving an assessment. If you, like me, watched this season without revisiting the other two, most likely your hype was through the roof when the season started. We didn't know anything about the story, we avoided reading the manga all this time and all that expectation that was generated was what made us be a little more critical of the work.Personal appreciation: the Vatican is the most useless organization I have ever seen. anime does are the emotional moments.

Furthermore, my favorite part of the opening is at the beginning when Yukio turns away worriedly, that gave me goosebumps, VERY BADASS!!!As for the story, I arrived a little hopeless because the 2nd season left a bitter taste in my mouth as it failed to make me sympathize with Rin's classmates, they were idiots who only think about themselves, but the third season already started with great character development, Koneko told several truths to her colleagues' faces and became much more likeable and badass, Suguro now uses a FUCKING BAZUCA against the demons and finally wants to stop making people depend on him, and Shima.... SHIMA RENZOU WAS THE STAR OF THIS SEASON!!!! The plot twist of him being a FUCKING SPY killed me!!! I spent 2 hours with my mouth open with this revelation!!!! He went from USELESS TRASH to one of the COOLEST GUYS IN ANIME, having a power capable of rivaling Rin's Satan flames! INCREDIBLE!!!!!!My favorite episodes were 4 and 11, respectively 4 being Lucifer's declaration of war and Shima's betrayal and 11, the episode where ALL THE STUDENTS basically cursed Mephisto and Rin was almost attacking him, Mephisto got pissed and demoted all students, ABSOLUT CINEMA, WHAT GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, FRIENDS!While in season 2 we had Todo, a LAME and BORING villain, here we have very interesting villains, Michael Gedoin is absolutely a despicable human being, but the simple fact that he just does everything he does just because he's IN LOVE WITH LUCIFER made me laugh out loud and it made me sympathize with him, after all, Lucifer is really an adorable and irresistible demon, besides, I don't judge him, because for Mephisto Pheles I would do the sameLucifer is incredible as are all of Satan's children, if Lucifer, Amaimon, Samael and Rin are at this level of beauty and power, I can't wait to see the others!!!!An important point for me as a fan of Mephisto Pheles is how this season made him SHINE! In the first and second, he seemed to be left a little aside and even nerfed a few times, but not here in the third, he appeared MANY TIMES (and that's a big deal for me), showed more of his demonic side and delivered, above all, BEAUTY AND ENTERTAINMENT, I was absurdly happy with Mephisto's participation, it gave me a lot of goosebumps!The end of the season also opens up a super interesting outcome, Yukio doubts whether to accept Lucifer's proposal, worried and anxious about his and his brother's future and we don't know if we can really trust Shima, it was a great season finale, my expectations are very high!!Finally, my rating is definitely 10,000 for this third season, even better than the first. If the third one was this good, I can't wait for the fourth season in October!!!!BEING A FAN OF AO NO EXORCIST IS SO WORTH IT!......[PT-BR]Já adianto: Essa Review contém SPOILERS e já recomendo urgentemente que TODOS ASSISTAM a essa temporada pois ela abriu uma nova era MUITO BOA PARA BLUE EXORCIST!!!!!Sou uma fã de carteirinha de Blue Exorcist, mas óbvio, isso não faz eu fechar meus olhos pra qualidade da história, que honestamente, estava bem devagar e um pouco chata até, a segunda temporada não é lá essas coisas, tem um vilão chato e sem graça além de uma trama entendiante, mas essa terceira temporada CHEGOU COM TUDO!!!Primeiramente falando da animação, a 1 temporada entrega um visual incrível e agradável para Rin, Mephisto, Yukio e Shura, mas para os seus colegas de classe, a situação não era tão boa assim, já na 3 temporada, o único ponto negativo foram ter cortado mais o cabelo do protagonista, mas de resto, ficou LINDO, deu muito mais brilho prós colegas sem graça de Rin, a abertura e o encerramento tbm são INCRÍVEIS, muito bem animadas e com cores lindas, coisa que não tínhamos antes em Aoex, fiquei muito orgulhosa ao ver o cuidado que eles estão tendo com a estética desse anime.A música da opening é INCRÍVEL também, UVERWORLD nos entrega músicas que ficam na cabeça desde 2011 e me deixa tão feliz em ver que a qualidade não caiu com o passar dos anos! Além do mais, minha parte favorita da abertura é no início quando Yukio vira de costas preocupada, aquilo me deu arrepios, MUITO BADASS!!!Quanto a história, eu cheguei meio desesperançosa pois a 2 temporada me deu um gosto amargo na boca pois não conseguiu me fazer simpatizar com os colegas de classe de Rin, eles eram uns babacas que apenas pensam neles mesmos, mas a terceira temporada já começou com um baita desenvolvimento dos personagens, Koneko disse várias verdades na cara de seus colegas e se tornou muito mais gostável e foda, Suguro agora usa uma FUCKING BAZUCA contra os demônios e finalmente quer parar de fazer as pessoas dependerem dele e Shima.... SHIMA RENZOU FOI A ESTRELA DESSA TEMPORADA!!!! O plot twist dele ser um FUCKING ESPIÃO acabou comigo!!! Eu fiquei 2 horas de boca aberta com essa revelação!!!! Ele passou de LIXO INÚTIL para um dos caras mais FODAS DO ANIME, tendo um poder capaz de rivalizar com as chamas de Satan de Rin! INCRÍVEL!!!!!!Meus episódios favoritos foram o 4 e o 11, respectivamente o 4 sendo a declaração de guerra de Lúcifer e a traição de Shima e o 11, o episódio onde TODOS OS ALUNOS basicamente xingam Mephisto e Rin estava quase o agredindo, Mephisto ficou puto e rebaixou todos os alunos, ABSOLUT CINEMA, QUE BAITA ENTRETENIMENTO MEUS AMIGOS!Enquanto a 2 temporada temos Todo, um vilão SEM GRAÇA e INSUPORTÁVEL, aqui temos vilões muito interessantes, Michael Gedoin é absolutamente um ser humano desprezível, mas o simples fato dele apenas fazer tudo o que faz apenas por ser APAIXONADO POR LÚCIFER me tirou altas risadas e fez com que eu me simpatizasse por ele, afinal, Lúcifer é realmente um demônio adorável e irresistível, além do mais, eu não o julgo, pois pelo Mephisto eu faria o mesmoLúcifer é incrível assim como todos os filhos de Satan, se Lúcifer, Amaimon, Samael e Rin estão assim nesse nível de beleza e poder, mal posso esperar para ver como serão os outros!Um importante ponto para mim como fã do Mephisto Pheles é como essa temporada fez ele BRILHAR! Na primeira e na segunda, ele parecia ser deixado meio de lado e até nerfado algumas vezes, mas aqui na terceira não, ele apareceu MUITAS VEZES (e isso é um prato cheio para mim), mostrou mais seu lado demoníaco e entregou, sobretudo, BELEZA E ENTRETENIMENTO, eu fiquei absurdamente feliz com a participação de Mephisto, me causou muitos arrepios!O final da temporada também abre um desfecho super interessante, Yukio com dúvidas se aceita a proposta de Lúcifer, preocupado e com ansiedade pelo seu futuro e do seu irmão e nós sem sabermos se podemos confiar em Shima realmente, foi um ótimo final de temporada, minhas expectativas estão muito altas!!Finalizando, a minha nota com certeza é 10000 para essa terceira temporada, sendo até melhor que a primeira. Se a terceira foi boa assim desse jeito, mal posso esperar pela quarta temporada em outubro!!!!SER FÃ DE AO NO EXORCIST VALE MUITO A PENA! was not that good, in the 3rd season, the only negative point was having The protagonist's hair was cut more, but otherwise, it was BEAUTIFUL, it gave much more shine to Rin's boring colleagues, the opening and ending are also AMAZING, very well animated and with beautiful colors, something we didn't have before in Aoex, I was very proud to see the care they were taking with the aesthetics of this anime.The opening song is AMAZING too, UVERWORLD gives us songs that have been stuck in our heads since 2011 and it makes me so happy to see that the quality hasn't dropped over the years! Furthermore, my favorite part of the opening is at the beginning when Yukio turns away worriedly, that gave me goosebumps, VERY BADASS!!!As for the story, I arrived a little hopeless because the 2nd season left a bitter taste in my mouth as it failed to make me sympathize with Rin's classmates, they were idiots who only think about themselves, but the third season already started with great character development, Koneko told several truths to her colleagues' faces and became much more likeable and badass, Suguro now uses a FUCKING BAZUCA against the demons and finally wants to stop making people depend on him, and Shima.... SHIMA RENZOU WAS THE STAR OF THIS SEASON!!!! The plot twist of him being a FUCKING SPY killed me!!! I spent 2 hours with my mouth open with this revelation!!!! He went from USELESS TRASH to one of the COOLEST GUYS IN ANIME, having a power capable of rivaling Rin's Satan flames! INCREDIBLE!!!!!!My favorite episodes were 4 and 11, respectively 4 being Lucifer's declaration of war and Shima's betrayal and 11, the episode where ALL THE STUDENTS basically cursed Mephisto and Rin was almost attacking him, Mephisto got pissed and demoted all students, ABSOLUT CINEMA, WHAT GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, FRIENDS!While in season 2 we had Todo, a LAME and BORING villain, here we have very interesting villains, Michael Gedoin is absolutely a despicable human being, but the simple fact that he just does everything he does just because he's IN LOVE WITH LUCIFER made me laugh out loud and it made me sympathize with him, after all, Lucifer is really an adorable and irresistible demon, besides, I don't judge him, because for Mephisto Pheles I would do the sameLucifer is incredible as are all of Satan's children, if Lucifer, Amaimon, Samael and Rin are at this level of beauty and power, I can't wait to see the others!!!!An important point for me as a fan of Mephisto Pheles is how this season made him SHINE! In the first and second, he seemed to be left a little aside and even nerfed a few times, but not here in the third, he appeared MANY TIMES (and that's a big deal for me), showed more of his demonic side and delivered, above all, BEAUTY AND ENTERTAINMENT, I was absurdly happy with Mephisto's participation, it gave me a lot of goosebumps!The end of the season also opens up a super interesting outcome, Yukio doubts whether to accept Lucifer's proposal, worried and anxious about his and his brother's future and we don't know if we can really trust Shima, it was a great season finale, my expectations are very high!!Finally, my rating is definitely 10,000 for this third season, even better than the first.

Alright to be fair, it was never that great to begin with, but man.Season 1 of Blue Exorcist was one of the first ever anime I fully watched to completion, and it really helped me get further into anime and appreciate it for what it is. Obviously this was back when I wasn\'t a colossal weeb who felt a little more grass on an average day. Anyways season 1 in hindsight was a decent show I guess, but it had a unique flair to it that made it stand out despite being fairly generic. Season 2 came...out years later, and just, ended up being very....boring? I couldn\'t get into it at all and figured I\'d drop the series, but alas, season 3 came after a very very short 7 years and.....yeah.The story of Rin, the half-baked son of the devil of the whole wide world, continues as he attends a school to expunge demons alongside his absolutely and totally not super generic and cliche trope-type cast of buddies as they all fight for their own morals, all of which mostly totally don\'t align with ""I must get stronger!"".I will actually give the story some props here. The first episode is terrible, extremely messy and rushed and just awful, but from there the story actually gets surprisingly interesting....for a bit. There are plot twists that actually make sense and are well executed, character developments that take place, and overall the feel is different.....for a few episodes. Eventually, without spoiling too much, this sort of returns to not at all being the case, but, at least for a few episodes the story actually became somewhat interesting. I haven\'t exactly read the manga for Blue Exorcist, but I have a feeling that the story was significantly better in the manga and that the anime adaptation probably cut some stuff out, because god the whole season felt as rushed as the birth of a mayfly.As I said above, the characters do have some solid moments. Although Rin is still insufferable and painfully annoying, this season does focus a bit more heavily on some side characters, mainly Izumo and Shima, both of whom get some pretty strong character development and moments. The rest of the cast? Exactly the same. That\'s not to say the cast is necessarily bad, but they all sorta feel like tropes, and well, are no different from previous seasons.One thing that helped previous seasons of Blue Exorcist stand out more was the unique art style, along with some solid animation. Unfortunately here we have neither of the two, as A-1 Pictures did not animate this season in their usual flair, and instead Studio VOLN took on the season. The art looks.....weird, and very plain. There are some moments where it looks decent, and the earlier episodes of the season actually look pretty good. However, as the season progresses, the art gets worse and worse, the character designs constantly seem to change and just look janky as hell. The animation....pure trash. Not gonna sugar coat it, it\'s awful. Every single fight scene in this season is just a still frame violently being shaken around like a damn pitcher of salt. There is also some CGI used throughout the season and my god. my lord it\'s so awful to look at.The OST is just sorta there. No real opinion on it. Some banger tracks from past seasons return like maybe 3 times throughout the whole season. The opening is solid. Ending bleh. I will give props to the voice cast, as they do a really solid job with attempting to give these bland unseasoned characters some sort of personality and life beyond being a walking trope.Honestly you could easily just not watch this season and absolutely nothing about your life would be any different. It\'s fine, it exists, and there are some great moments. The story is genuinely interesting, but unfortunately it\'s very much watered down by the horrifically fast pacing, the godawful animation, and the lack of overall development. I also had a major problem with the balancing of comedy and seriousness this season, it felt particularly bad during season 3, but that could just be me.If you absolutely love Blue Exorcist and really want to see more of Rin and his McDonalds Playplace Buddies, watch Blue Exorcist Season 3 Shimane Illuminati Confirmed Saga. Or if you\'re just bored and need something to watch then sure. Otherwise watching this really won\'t derive much of an opinion out of you tbh.Pros: Solid story, interesting worldbuilding, decent character moments, some good twistsCons: The animation, the pacing, and most of the cast just being annoying, as well as a lack of development for both the story and cast.

B'T X,https://myanimelist.net/anime/286/BT_X,"['If you are very familiar with Kurumada Masami, many of the plot and character elements share a lot in common with some of his earlier works, specifically Saint Seiya and Ringu ni Kakero. For example, family bond and longing to reunite with a lost sibling is once again an emphasized theme in this series. It gives Teppei a strong motivation to go on an initial one man mission to fight an empire to save his brother. Though in Saint Seiya, Seiya wanting to find his sister gets sidetracked until nearly the end, this element is consistent throughout the series.Another Kurumada-sensei characteristic is a female...mentor to the main character who is serves as a sister figure. In Saint Seiya, Seiya is taught my Marin who he assumes to be his sister. In Ringu ni Kakero, Ryuji is trained by his sister Kiku. While in B’t X, Teppei is trained by Karen who you can say is like a big sister figure to Teppei though they don’t out right say it and its interesting to note that their relationship isn’t really that 100% explored in this series but the series shows the full picture with very little.However, this story does feel darker compared to those other works and has little to no comedic elements. Teppei very rarely smiles in comparison to Seiya who share a 100% similar design and is always dead serious and has more of a I wanna kick some ass kind of look. So it works in consistent with the atmosphere.Another element is mythological influences. While Saint Seiya has uses Greek, B’t X uses Asian mythologies though some elements of Greek and other European sources will be present later on.But really drives this series is the relationship between Teppei and X and the theme of unlocking your own potential. Like how Saint Seiya had this theme of “making miracles happen,” this anime also brings those qualities in this series and works in its own way with Teppei and X. At first, X wants nothing to do with Teppei but when Teppei proves his determination to X, X becomes loyal to Teppei and you do see this relationship develop to the point where all things are possible.The remaining cast such as Hokuto, Fou, and Ron do bring a shade of gray. Despite being warriors of the machine empire, they understand what needs to be done and its not because of lack of loyalty, but a matter of personal principle and understanding they don’t want an everybody loses situation. Even though they don’t acknowledge themselves as Teppei’s friends throughout the series, they encourage him to reach his fullest potential which makes you question why they want that. Do they want to fight him at his best? Or do they want him to defeat the machine empire?Unfortunately, this series ends where things are about to really get started but thankfully there is an ova series to continue which I will review at a later date.Naturally, Teppei looks 100% like Seiya and Ryuji. Kurumada-sensei had admitted he “recycles” his character designs because he thinks of them as his own actors and giving them different roles. Not only Teppei, but other characters such as Fou, Ron, and Kotaro will also feel familiar to those that are fans of Kurumada-sensei’s works so expect that. But not only does it feel like Kurumada-sensei, a lot of the designs also feel like Obari Masami. The sharpness and the details to the eyes remind me of how he did the designs of the Fatal Fury anime but I don’t see him in the credits, but I guess it does give an appropriate 90s feel to it when that sharpness and the over detailed eyes were a common quality in other popular series of that time such as Saber Marionette J, El Hazard, and Magic Knight Rayearth.The design of the mechs are pretty cool. As previously stated, there is more influence on Asian mythology so the B’ts are more influenced by Chinese animals seen as divine. For example, X is based on the Kirin, Fuo’s mecha based on the Phoenix, Ron is based on the dragon and Hokuto’s mech is based on the turtle. And other’s each offer their own gimmick and given an appropriate colour scheme. So they all work out and have functions that work in conjunction to their size and designs. However, I really don’t get why Teppei gets battle armour as some sort of power up while the other characters don’t. The series does explain why he has it, but I don’t understand why he is the only one that gets it while Fou and Ron don’t.The action isn’t as explosive as Ringu ni Kakero and Saint Seiya but works in its own ways. The action is not too gimmicky but still distinctive. For example, some characters will have techniques that will hurt the ear drums and some have moves that will make the opponents hallucinate. This time, the anime revolves around wit and sheer will but in a new context and team work is used in a unique way. The moves are more science oriented such as Teppei’s messiah fist and Fou’s violin bow which resonates sound waves.A lot of people like to categorize this as a mech anime but I feel that I don’t. Considering that the mech isn’t exactly controlled and feels more like a partner, so I see this more as a sci-fi action anime as opposed to flat out mech though  mech is a sub-genre of sci-fi. The action relies on trusting each other. Though it feels like one on one, it is two on two instead with Teppei and X against their opponent and their B’t. The action isn’t as reliant on using special moves so typical hand to hand combat will be more frequently used. It is more speed and agility oriented as opposed to power oriented so it is still pretty distinct in comparison to Saint Seiya and Ringu ni Kakero.Though Kurumada-sensei likes to “recast” his actors in his manga, unfortunately, Furuya Tooru does not resume his role as that design. Playing the voice of Teppei is Hiyama Nobuyuki, most famous for the roles of Hiei from Yuu Yuu Hakusho and Shiro from Gundam 08th MS team. His pitch is more in tune with the upbeat feel of Shiro as opposed to the lower voice he uses as Hiei. He is very aggressive but soft. He does come across as a teenager, but yet mature and world weary but does have this feel of optimism. Sasaki Nozomu, the voice of Yusuke from Yuu Yuu Hakusho and Tetsuo from Akira is the voice of Teppei’s brother Kotaro. His voice feels a lot like Horikawa Ryo’s performance as Shun who is more compassionate, soft, and low and feels a bit feminine. And compared to those performances, it feels distinct and fresh and gives you a new exposure to his acting talents.Another great talent I enjoyed was that of Fujiwara Keiji as Ron. Fujiwara tends to play characters who are more of a smart ass like Kimura from Hajime no Ippo, Reno in Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, and Shingo from Initial D. But in this series he is very serious, and mode cold and calculating. His voice is recognizable, but he does sound appropriately intimidating and not as comedic as he is in more notable roles. My only issue with the voice acting is that they don’t modulate X’s voice. The series modulates the other b’ts appropriately sounding more mechanic but X sounds like a regular guy. I don’t know if its done purposely to give him a more human quality but I prefer if he had a more mechanical voice. It could flow like a regular person but I think it should modulated like the voices in Transformers.The music is just awesome. The background music works very well. Like whenever Teppei battle gears on, the soundtrack really gives the “shine” that Teppei shows. It gives an uplifting feel in this dark world. The other music just simply works in conjunction with the atmosphere of the series. The opening theme also has this intense feel but also shares the themes of breaking the limits and about hope. So really nothing to add but say the music speaks for itself when you watch it.Of course after you finish this series, you will be required to watch the following ova to get any continuation and direction. However, throughout watching this you also get the impression that you also need to read the manga to put more things into context. Unfortunately, I have not read the manga so I will read it when I get the chance. But consistently, you have heard me compare this to Kurumada-sensei’s previous works and do I say this is a gateway to how he does things. I personally don’t recommend this anime for people new to Kurumada Masami even though some things are different. I say having some familiarity with his style and work will help you understand this anime more, specifically the two titles I repeatedly mentioned. mentor to the main character who is serves as a sister figure. In Saint Seiya, Seiya is taught my Marin who he assumes to be his sister. In Ringu ni Kakero, Ryuji is trained by his sister Kiku. While in B’t X, Teppei is trained by Karen who you can say is like a big sister figure to Teppei though they don’t out right say it and its interesting to note that their relationship isn’t really that 100% explored in this series but the series shows the full picture with very little.However, this story does feel darker compared to those other works and has little to no comedic elements.

The sharpness and the details to the eyes remind me of how he did the designs of the Fatal Fury anime but I don’t see him in the credits, but I guess it does give an appropriate 90s feel to it when that sharpness and the over detailed eyes were a common quality in other popular series of that time such as Saber Marionette J, El Hazard, and Magic Knight Rayearth.The design of the mechs are pretty cool. As previously stated, there is more influence on Asian mythology so the B’ts are more influenced by Chinese animals seen as divine. For example, X is based on the Kirin, Fuo’s mecha based on the Phoenix, Ron is based on the dragon and Hokuto’s mech is based on the turtle. And other’s each offer their own gimmick and given an appropriate colour scheme. So they all work out and have functions that work in conjunction to their size and designs. However, I really don’t get why Teppei gets battle armour as some sort of power up while the other characters don’t. The series does explain why he has it, but I don’t understand why he is the only one that gets it while Fou and Ron don’t.The action isn’t as explosive as Ringu ni Kakero and Saint Seiya but works in its own ways. The action is not too gimmicky but still distinctive. For example, some characters will have techniques that will hurt the ear drums and some have moves that will make the opponents hallucinate. This time, the anime revolves around wit and sheer will but in a new context and team work is used in a unique way. The moves are more science oriented such as Teppei’s messiah fist and Fou’s violin bow which resonates sound waves.A lot of people like to categorize this as a mech anime but I feel that I don’t. Considering that the mech isn’t exactly controlled and feels more like a partner, so I see this more as a sci-fi action anime as opposed to flat out mech though  mech is a sub-genre of sci-fi. The action relies on trusting each other. Though it feels like one on one, it is two on two instead with Teppei and X against their opponent and their B’t. The action isn’t as reliant on using special moves so typical hand to hand combat will be more frequently used. It is more speed and agility oriented as opposed to power oriented so it is still pretty distinct in comparison to Saint Seiya and Ringu ni Kakero.Though Kurumada-sensei likes to “recast” his actors in his manga, unfortunately, Furuya Tooru does not resume his role as that design. Playing the voice of Teppei is Hiyama Nobuyuki, most famous for the roles of Hiei from Yuu Yuu Hakusho and Shiro from Gundam 08th MS team. His pitch is more in tune with the upbeat feel of Shiro as opposed to the lower voice he uses as Hiei. He is very aggressive but soft. He does come across as a teenager, but yet mature and world weary but does have this feel of optimism. Sasaki Nozomu, the voice of Yusuke from Yuu Yuu Hakusho and Tetsuo from Akira is the voice of Teppei’s brother Kotaro. His voice feels a lot like Horikawa Ryo’s performance as Shun who is more compassionate, soft, and low and feels a bit feminine. And compared to those performances, it feels distinct and fresh and gives you a new exposure to his acting talents.Another great talent I enjoyed was that of Fujiwara Keiji as Ron. Fujiwara tends to play characters who are more of a smart ass like Kimura from Hajime no Ippo, Reno in Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, and Shingo from Initial D. But in this series he is very serious, and mode cold and calculating. His voice is recognizable, but he does sound appropriately intimidating and not as comedic as he is in more notable roles. My only issue with the voice acting is that they don’t modulate X’s voice. The series modulates the other b’ts appropriately sounding more mechanic but X sounds like a regular guy. I don’t know if its done purposely to give him a more human quality but I prefer if he had a more mechanical voice. It could flow like a regular person but I think it should modulated like the voices in Transformers.The music is just awesome. The background music works very well. Like whenever Teppei battle gears on, the soundtrack really gives the “shine” that Teppei shows. It gives an uplifting feel in this dark world. The other music just simply works in conjunction with the atmosphere of the series. The opening theme also has this intense feel but also shares the themes of breaking the limits and about hope. So really nothing to add but say the music speaks for itself when you watch it.Of course after you finish this series, you will be required to watch the following ova to get any continuation and direction. However, throughout watching this you also get the impression that you also need to read the manga to put more things into context. Unfortunately, I have not read the manga so I will read it when I get the chance. But consistently, you have heard me compare this to Kurumada-sensei’s previous works and do I say this is a gateway to how he does things. I personally don’t recommend this anime for people new to Kurumada Masami even though some things are different. I say having some familiarity with his style and work will help you understand this anime more, specifically the two titles I repeatedly mentioned.', ""StoryAlthough at first glance, B'tX appears to be 'just another mecha story', it's a little bit more than that. The story is excellent, but it is executed poorly - it has potential that is just never truly used. It's similar in concept to 'Zoids'. The idea that bio-mechanical,  intelligent mecha creatures mingle with humans is interestingly placed into the story, but there are many cliche's and it's easy to predict what will happen next. It's a sad case of works-in-theory but not in execution. Overall, I gave it a six because coming from the studio that produced Akira I expected a little bit more.ArtThe...art can be obnoxious at times, but it's generally acceptable, with stunning amounts of detail on the b'ts and intriguing character designs.The animation itself can be irritating, mainly because they recycle animation frequently. The first five minutes of every episode is a recap, and they insist upon using the two-minute 'transformation' sequence whenever Teppei and X go into battle - at least twice an episode. It gets old quickly but, then again, that's why fast-foward was created. Ignoring the fact that many sequences are recycled over and over, the actual effects have a very 80's-anime appearance, somewhat reminiscent of Dragon Ball.CharacterThe character development is limited and restrained, characteristic of this studio's other productions. What surprised me was, despite the fact that the characters are highly stereotypical (The 80's-hair Bible-thumping bishie, evil scientists, the over-muscled baddies) you get drawn into them in a odd way that, even if you can tell what they will do next, you need to see the next episode. I gave the characters a five because, looking at the studio's portfolio it's fairly middle-of-the-road compared to shows like Doraemon and Panda Go Panda.SoundThe sound, especially in the dub, are enough to drive a person insane. Instead of having voice actors actually whisper or yell, they simply have them speak normally and then adjust the background music to give the impression of whispering or shouting. This results in hard-to-hear voices, as well as generally bad voice acting. So much of the audio in this makes a person want to cry, and not in a good way, either.Overall / EnjoymentI scored this a nine and eight in the end solely because of the concept of the story. The actual idea of the story is very interesting, but it is so terribly executed that it ruins it. I can see people starting roleplays or writing fanfiction based on the ideas of b'tx, if not the actual anime itself. art can be obnoxious at times, but it's generally acceptable, with stunning amounts of detail on the b'ts and intriguing character designs.The animation itself can be irritating, mainly because they recycle animation frequently.

It was like my shounen balance to my love of Sailor Moon at the time. --Which pretty much means it ...was almost the opposite of Sailor Moon (which is a good thing for shounen).Story: 8/10Big baddy versus talented youth SOUNDS cliche, but what really sets this story apart is the world and how dark it eventually gets. The world-building is done wonderfully here. It's a wonderful mesh between what we consider the 'real world' and a dark, dystopian world of mecha.The real joy in this story...is the eventual unfolding of the plot. The writers took a cliche story and gave it a pretty dark backstory. There are some points where you sort of have to stop and take in how absolutely terrible the scenario is for some of these people. You have wars, friends and families who die right in front of them, an overtone of supernatural evil etc etc.In a way, I found it really depressing. I actually couldn't see how on Earth the heroes were going to win. In the end, that's the genius of this anime. Usually when a semi-powerful Hero goes up against an all-powerful Villain, it's pretty obvious the hero's going to win.--Not in this case. This Villain is one mysterious bad-ass with an army of crazy (and crazily strong) minions whose numbers feel like they could swallow our heroes whole.Art: 8/10Not bad, typical 90s shounen style. I had a crush on Teppei as a kid so I'm a little biased.   ...And I also wanted a B'T because they're just so awesome. If you look at them, their actually very intracately designed!Sound: 10/10I loved the OST. I absolutely loved it. It was exciting, moving, and completely fitting to the anime.Character: 8/10They're a little cliche, but somehow still loveable. There's always an extra something in their personalities that sets them apart from other characters of the same cliche. It's one of those things you can't really put your finger on.Enjoyment: 8/10...I really...REALLY liked this lol.(Not as much as the OVA though.)Overall: 8/10Recommended --highly even. It's a good story, and I might even call it 'classic' more than cliche because it really has depth to it. It's not as well known as other animes of the same type and genre, but I still think it's better than most of them by FAR. Like I said, the good ones always have you wondering how it'll end.

Thus I really can't judge things in their entirety and only in regards to the story up until now. However there are some points which already stand alone in this part. Also I haven't seen the third season for now, so everything I'll discuss will focus on this part alone.Story: 4Animation: 2Sound: 5Characters: 3Enjoyment: 4Total: 3One of the most glaring things this anime suffers from most is the art. The animation is borderline lazy, even though it highly improves in the later episodes...bit by bit. But the early part is really rough on the eyes. Even in the very first scene there is an animation error very glaringly in a repeating manner. At that point I could already sense that the animation wouldn't be a contender for a top spot. Repeating frames, still poses and frequent zooms are a norm here. I also have the feeling that some characters underwent a design change in the middle of the series, but that could be dependent on the animation changes in the latter half.And before I continue with the characters, I have to outline the story structure a bit, because the characters very much depend on that.The general story is packed as a monster of the week with a big bad monster already teased in the early episodes, which isn't even fought against in this part. The story is very fight focused and rarely are there important character interactions between adversaries. For the most part, both protagonist are bickering at each other because they refuse to work together but have to to survive. But later they learn to work together and even improve each other by this. It is a very old trope but still handled in a boring manner. One party simply gives up on the bickering part and let himself be controlled which results in a detriment for both and after that they appreciate each other. There isn't anything spectacular about the way they approach the subject. It just happens.Other that the partial character development and the animation, there isn't anything finished up until now. The story structure isn't finished for now. But if it remain the way it is now, I would argue that it was handled very poorly. The fights are drawn out way to hard and content of less than one episode is almost always drawn out to two episodes. If the story continues in the flow it had up until now, the story will drag on for far to long as it would've easily been possible to conclude it in the first two seasons. But it isn't the case and I will have to surprise myself.For now, B'T X is a weak anime with an even weaker A-Plot which gets out shined by the B-Plot, and even that isn't that great. The early episodes are carried by the B-Plot as it had all the mystery and anticipation collected. But as it waned in its content, the A-Plot had to take the reigns and only did so because we already had to spent multiple episodes with it. By the end the B-Plot will be degraded to the C-Plot which is a shame because it still was the most interesting part.If this fact doesn't change in the final season, B'T X will remain as a show which was blinded by its own action for a worse experience as its disregarded its own qualities. bit by bit.

Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37595/Cardcaptor_Sakura__Clear_Card-hen_Recap,[]
Chicchana Yukitsukai Sugar Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1014/Chicchana_Yukitsukai_Sugar_Specials,"['To tell you the truth, this is a series that I watched very recently.  It’s been out for around fifteen years, and I really only knew about it from it’s infamously sugary name and occasional appearances in the first few AMV Hell videos, but I never really picked it up until I saw it for 15 bucks in the Sentai filmworks holiday sale, and I wound up watching it as part of my January vacation from work.  I was expecting a dumb, pandering, diabetically sweet series meant to keep little girls quiet while entertaining them with as little effort as possible, but I...was surprised to see that it was actually one of the best children’s anime I’ve ever seen.  And the OVA at the end was even better.I won’t spoil the framing device that the OVA uses, because it actually is a pretty big spoiler, but it does feature an event that apparently took place in the timeline of the series.  Saga’s class is putting on a play, which was written by one of her classmates.  The fairies also put on a play of their own, despite having only recently learned what the concept of a play really is.  Their play winds up being a sort of distillation of the original, named Princess and Fairy,” and while we don’t get to see the play from start to finish, we do get to see the Fairies’ interpretation of it, as well as just enough material to tie up the various plot threads of the episodes.As highly as I regard Sugar, it had a couple of flaws that made me back off from giving it a perfect score.  It had a vaguely pedo-ish story arc involving an actor in a bear costume, and while Saga talking to her invisible fairies in front of people made her look crazy at first, the story seemed to drop that piece of logic very early on, so she could have entire side conversations with them and nobody would notice.  The OVA manages to avoid both of these problems, despite the fact that it brazenly references the bear storyline at several points.  It acts as a call-back to many characters and events, but at no point does any of it feel forced or contrived, and everything works into the plot perfectly.These special episodes really are a representation of everything that was great about Sugar, with no noticeable drop in quality either for the animation or the writing.  True, it doesn’t really represent the more emotional moments in the series, but there are feels to go around in the bookend sections, and the fact that it was able to combine so many elements into one short story while remaining true to everyone’s personalities and dynamic means that it must have been put together with a deft hand by someone who loved and understood the original material. was surprised to see that it was actually one of the best children’s anime I’ve ever seen.

Cardfight!! Vanguard,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9539/Cardfight_Vanguard,"[""Cardfight Vanguard in many ways is similar to other TCG anime such as Yu-Gi-Oh! But also has it's many differences. The card game aside, the biggest difference would be that the plot doesn't revolve around some evil power trying to destroy the world, but I'll get to that later.Story: 9/10This is probably what shocked me the most. I went in watching Vanguard with expectations that it would be bad and a downgraded version of Yu-Gi-Oh, but boy was I wrong. The story is about a kid who get's bullied in school, and someone has hope for him in the popular Card game at the time,...Vanguard. He's then shown how to play and is somewhat good at it. Without spoilers, I can say that no one tries to fight evil off and they try to progress and get better; hone their skills etc. and that's what attracted me to the show.Art: 7/10I've never been an art person, I mean, I watch One Piece. :P That aside, I'm not the sort of person who judges something based on the art style, but this one was particularly good. You've got the general anime style of the show with nothing major happening, and then you see those cards come to life, Wingal, Marron, Blaster Blade and it looks wonderful. Even the cards themselves look very appealing in the anime, but the general style let it down.Character: 6/10Aichi Sendo is a boy in Middle School who was bullied and for that reason, he has a very timid personality. Kai is the jerk of the series, much similar to the likes of Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh, being a jerk and not caring about anything but winning. Kamui is high spirited and has hopes for everyone. He's probably the most loved person in the show in my eyes. Misaki is the shopkeeper who doesn't pay attention to much, but she ghet's better. There really isn't much character development yet apart from Misaki, so I can't rate this higher at the moment.Enjoyment: 8/10As I've said in the story section, what attracted me the most was the fact that they're not fighting for the likes of humanity, but to proceed in a tournament and get better at Vanguard. The card game itself is very well thought out and has it's complexity as well as being just a general fun game. It's fast-paced and works well. As for characters, I would've liked to see Aichi a little more confident, but it's still enjoyable nonetheless.Overall: 8/10The story works surprisingly, the art is well set up and pretty good, the sound is very well played, the Characters could be better, the enjoyment was great, and that's why this is a good overall score. It's a nice anime to try and get into, and you can even get into the card game while you're at it. Vanguard. He's then shown how to play and is somewhat good at it. Without spoilers, I can say that no one tries to fight evil off and they try to progress and get better; hone their skills etc. and that's what attracted me to the show.Art: 7/10I've never been an art person, I mean, I watch One Piece. :P That aside, I'm not the sort of person who judges something based on the art style, but this one was particularly good. You've got the general anime style of the show with nothing major happening, and then you see those cards come to life, Wingal, Marron, Blaster Blade and it looks wonderful. Even the cards themselves look very appealing in the anime, but the general style let it down.Character: 6/10Aichi Sendo is a boy in Middle School who was bullied and for that reason, he has a very timid personality. Kai is the jerk of the series, much similar to the likes of Seto Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh, being a jerk and not caring about anything but winning. Kamui is high spirited and has hopes for everyone.

Vanguard that whoever said ""Don\'t judge a book by its cover"" was...clearly not talking about this show. Yes, Cardfight is a show you can and should judge by its cover, as that judgment will determine whether or not you should watch the show. But I\'ll get to that later. Let\'s run the bases:The story is basically thus: people play card games. Or rather, card game. Vanguard is the ""big thing"" in the world of Cardfight, as one might expect. For at least half the series, this basic idea is what the show runs on. It occasionally...shows signs of wanting to do something more, but I have to be honest: most of it comes off as cheesy and laughable. But, well, that\'s only the first half of the series. Somewhere along the line, you start to be able to actually take the show seriously and like it. Its pacing seems slow at first (expected with 65 episodes of run time), but it\'s all the better to develop characters and situations with. In the end, Cardfight actually becomes a great story about learning who you are and understanding others through the lens of this card game. Power of Friendship is nothing new to anime, but it can still be done well, and Cardfight pulls it off.Obviously it\'s not without its perks. If you\'re not into the card game thing (which really shouldn\'t be the case if you even pick the show up, but still), you\'ll have a hard time getting into the meat of things. Then there\'s the deal with Psyqualia; although the last couple episodes make it obvious that more is coming, we don\'t learn much about this rare ability that is very important to the plot. We don\'t know where it comes from, how it chooses people, how it really works, how it may possibly be controlled, etc. All we know is that it has a tendency to bring out the worst in people.Nevertheless, the perks tend to be minor and shouldn\'t bother you too much if you go into the show knowing what to expect: lots of card games. And lots of card games you will get.Art and animation is reasonable for what seems to be an average-budget kid\'s show. Many settings and details are rather plain, but the card fights are all well-animated and the monsters all look pretty cool and distinguishable. It\'s obvious where they put the effort, and really: what else would you expect?Now, I could have sworn when I first heard him that the main character in this was voiced by a woman, but I was wrong. Seriously, for a long time Aichi sounds very girly and wimpy. It\'s odd at first, but you get used to it, and when Stuff Starts Happening, it gets better.Voice work is, again, of fairly standard quality; it\'s good, usually well done, and generally not poor. There is, at least, nothing for me to complain about. Music is quite well done. The second opening in particular is a great way to get hyped, especially in the final 15 or so episodes when things really start to get heated. In-series music stays suitably light-hearted. It is, essentially, ""game music."" It never takes itself too seriously (well, until the last episode), and this turns out to be for the better.As I mentioned before, Aichi sounds very wimpy and girly for a long time. This is because he is. As an example, when asked what he would do in a dangerous situation, his response is to ""always be sure I have a path of retreat behind me."" I know what you\'re thinking: ""Not another wimpy male lead! I\'ll pass!"" And no, it\'s not the most pleasant thing to behold. But in a way, I was able to accept it. I remembered that this show is aimed more at kids than someone my own age, and since I knew it would go on for a while, I was able to bear it even though I didn\'t like it (just the character, not the show). I was rewarded in the end. Aichi gradually grows into a mature character with a backbone that I was proud to see through. As his ability in Vanguard grows, so does he. He learns to fight his fights, help others, and make a name for himself.65 episodes leaves room for a lot of characters, but I don\'t want to go into full detail on all of them or I\'ll be here all night. Basically: the important characters all get their time, and the side characters get a reasonable amount, good and bad. Kai just seems like you\'re typical, stone cold, bad friend for a long time, and though he really only turns into a jerk with a heart of gold, seeing what he went through really makes you understand and relate to him as a character, and this also leads into the development for the series\' main villain, Ren, who is a huge, overconfident (well, he largely does have the ability to back it up) asshole that you just can\'t wait to see defeated (note: that isn\'t a bad thing).Skipping over a few characters to the negative side: Katsumi, an eventual friend of Aichi, is the comic relief who is...just not funny. He\'s a loser who thinks he\'s awesome, and the gimmick gets really old really fast and just never dies. That\'s the worst of it, but Doctor O, the guest commentator for tournament Cardfights, I think was also supposed to be humorous, and again, isn\'t. He\'s just kind of strange. But luckily, he isn\'t overdone.Here\'s the important part of the review, as I hinted at in the first paragraph: if you read all that and thought, ""Doesn\'t sound like a show I\'d ever want to watch,"" trust yourself; don\'t watch it. You\'re probably not going to like it. I went into this wanting a show about card games just for a fun twenty minutes every week and got exactly what I wanted. If that\'s what you want, go for it; you won\'t be let down. But it has to be stressed: you really must know you want this if you\'re going to enjoy it. It\'s not going to surprise you and turn into something epic if you\'re not prepared to watch a lot of card games (65 episodes, remember?). You\'ll probably just drop it before you hit the ten episode mark.Think about what you want. If you\'re ever thinking, ""Yeah, I could use a fun show about a card game to kill some time,"" that is when you should watch this. It is very much a kid\'s show (read: not average MAL age), so you need to be either young enough or old enough to really enjoy and respect it.Personally, I went into it thinking it would be as I just described: a time-killer every week. Watch some card games for fun. It was never high on my priority list, but I always looked out for it. But then somewhere along the line it turned into something more. It became highly anticipated, and eventually it was the show I looked forward to the most every week (and by Winter 2012 I was keeping up with 20+ shows). If you ARE willing to watch and have fun with the show\'s first half, you\'ll be more than excited to continue as you get further on in the series.I don\'t consider myself the greatest of reviewers, but I wanted to do this show some justice and provide both sides of the spectrum: the kind of person who will like it and the kind of person who won\'t. Otherwise I feel most people wouldn\'t ever give this show more than passing glance and just write it off as some twenty minute commercial for a children\'s trading card game. And it largely is just that, but it\'s also more than that. It\'s nothing amazing, and it never tries to be. And there\'s nothing wrong with that. It\'s still a good series.Now, I\'m off to buy a starter deck and choose my new avatar... shows signs of wanting to do something more, but I have to be honest: most of it comes off as cheesy and laughable.

The common misconception about anime card shows is that they are only for kids and they don't have good stories. I walked into this show initially because I watched Yugioh and I liked the character art, but the anime has gotten me hooked within the first few episodes.Story: 7/10There are pros and cons to the story, but It generally remains in a positive light. It's a story about growth as both a person and a player. It is nice to see how Aichi starts off timid and grows stronger and braver as the series progress....Although it can be a bit slow paced at the start, it sets off a nice and lighthearted school life mood at the start of the series. The show gets especially interesting after the mid twenties as they go to nationals and meet some interesting individuals and rivals.Art: 8/10The character art for both characters and cards are appealing. The guys and girls generally look pretty nice, and no one has absurd multi colored hair. The monsters range from cute looking characters and knights to dragons and zombies.Sound: 9/10I love the music themes, especially the second opening and both ending songs. The battle music is pretty intense and makes the matches more fun to watch.The first opening song is a bit weird, but you grow fond of it over time.Character: 7/10Characters personalities are hit and miss, some are cool, and some can be annoying. Aichi is the timid boy who becomes stronger over time, Kai has a cold personality, but actually cares about Aichi, Morikawa is the idiotic joke character who is bad at vanguard. However, the main characters all have back stories and through hardship, eventually grow and learn to love Vanguard, which is nice to see.Overall: 8/10A good show that has a nice lighthearted charm to it. The game is fun and intriguing, and the music make the battles more entertaining to watch. The art is nice and the story gets progressively interesting as you watch more episodes. It's far from being a masterpiece, but it is a show worth your time. Although it can be a bit slow paced at the start, it sets off a nice and lighthearted school life mood at the start of the series.

So why all the 5\'s, well, let\'s me discuss it:Story: mediocre number 5.Ok, so it\'s all about a muchacho who get\'s into a cardfight in order to prove something to himself.

I thought the story was great and well written, I adored the characters and I loved the soundtrack. Yeah, the production values were not that great but least it was tolerable. Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 is one of my favourite anime alongside with Code Geass, Clannad and Slayers. However, I was 14 years old when first watched Cardfight Vanguard and I was still developing my tastes. Fast forward 6 years later in the year 2018 where my tastes in anime had grown, I decided to re-watch Cardfight Vanguard...just to see how it holds up as an anime without my late nostalgia for it. After re-watching 65 episodes of Cardfight Vanguard, I have to say this. Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 is a good anime, however, I don\'t think that the show is great as I use to as it has a lot of flaws that hurt the show quite a bit.The story follows a young timid boy named Aichi Sendou who is a had time socialising with his peers at school. The thing that kept him going in life was his rare card Blaster Blade which he received when he was a kid. It\'s an important rare card from ""Vanguard"", a card game with the imaginary world of ""Planet Cray"" as its stage. From the day he reunited with the person who gave him that card ""Toshiki Kai"", Aichi\'s everyday life began to change.The story of Cardfight Vanguard is pretty good but at the same time pretty flawed but for let\'s talk about the good starting with the first 2 episodes.This is easily the best first episode I have ever seen in a card game because not only does the show does a fantastic job at establishing the game itself as well it\'s characters, world-building and themes but it also a great job at drawing the audience in into the show. I loved how nicely paced where the first cardfight was as it nicely explained all the rules about the game itself making the viewer interested in buying the actual cards itself.The one thing that this show has over other card game anime is that the show is narratively grounded. Most of the dialogue, characters and even the cardfights were grounded where many scenes of the anime actually happen in real such as communication failure, misplaying, teammates looking out for each other when times at rough to even skill and luck that can put you into a winning side or a losing side.Out of all the card game anime that I have seen Cardfight Vanguard was the only card game anime that I was really infested in as most of the fights were won/loss by pure skill and luck rather than asspulling and Deus ex machina bullcrap that plagued Yugioh anime since 2000.Along with the shows, grounded feel comes in the show\'s world-building. I don\'t mean by city establishments but about the player diving into the hobby of card games where not the show a lot of realistic details such as having people open actual booster packs a tournament setting in a local shop where we spectators and players enjoying the game of Cardfight Vanguard as well a having an official national/regional tournaments that are professional in design and tone. This was easily the one thing that Cardfight Vanguard has over any other card game anime like Yugioh, Selector WIOXSS and Future Card Buddyfight and am glad the show put a lot of effort of making the life as a vanguard player feel very realistic and relatable.(Spoilers Ahead)Speaking of realistic Cardfight Vanguard least in season 1 by far the most realistic card game anime to ever exist as from start to finish the anime is very grounded in nature we see the highs and lows of set vanguard player, for example, Aichi, in the beginning, was a timid player who is not that good with game who often makes misplays just like a real new vanguard.However, the series progresses where after Aichi and the rest of Q4 lose they first nationals as well Kai giving him the motivation to get better Aichi starts to become a more confident fighter. However, due to Psyqualia Aichi starts to have a downward spiral where he almost completely himself as it starts being this cruel to not only his opponents where he completely slaughtered them in a Cardfight but his fellow teammates calling them weaklings.However, after Kai destroyed his Psyqualia winning spree Aichi starts to reflect off all the bad things he has done while he was consumed by Psyqualia and from there Aichi becomes a much better person where he doesn\'t rely on gifted power to win as being a loving caring person.(End Of Spoilers)Cardfight Vanguard biggest strength is how the show portrayed it\'s realistic portrayal it\'s themes that actually happen in real life. Themes of teamwork, commutation, redemption, regret, were beautifully explored in the anime as each of the 4 characters one of two of these them into they respective characters arcs that goes on in the story.Unfortunately, Cardfight Vanguard does have some flaws. The second half in pacing and at times quality times was inferior as the soon as Q4 loses the first national tournament the story starts to drag quite a bit where many of the episodes are just a repeat of the first half but with less charm put them for the most part. As much I love seeing Aichi using his Psyqualia to brutally destroy his opponents in cardfights I feel like the other content such as Team Q4 second journey of being the national champions to be pretty lacking until the final 5 of the series.Along with team Q4 second journey being less exciting compared to the first comes in the show predictably where almost every single cardfight in the second half seemed to have thick plot armour at various times competently ruins cardgames. I won\'t any of the cardfights as it will to big spoiler territory but all I say that I was a bit I was a bit upset when a more grounded card game anime such as this has deiced to take the predictable route that was for the most part not fun. This is stuff that I expect from Future Card Buddyfight and sure that show was a bit predictable but least that show was self-aware of itself plus team\xa0Balle du Soleil journey of winning the ABC and Gaen Cup were not a chore to watch compare to this.The biggest problem that I had with Cardfight Vanguard season 1 is Ren as well the poorly executed\xa0Psyqualia elements. Ren himself was a decent villain at as he simply to gather many skilled cardfighters under his leadership in Team Asteroid, however, thanks to a terrible line that Ren said in one episode he quickly devolved into this generic power-hungry villain who simply wanted to take over the world using his Psyqualia. It was a shame because I kinda liked him as a character.As for the Psyqualia elements it was okay in the beginning but the further the show progresses the less sense it make thanks to show subpar build up of it as it just came out of nowhere especially in the last 3 episodes as the show tried to make\xa0 Psyqualia more epic than it actually is but failed due to shotty directing as the show barely truly shows the true existence of Psyqualia enough for the viewer to care.Overall despite the flaws that I mentioned, I thought the story of Cardfight Vanguard to above average. It may have a lot of good things but at the same time, it has quite a bit of mediocre things that at various points hurts the show.When it comes to the characters in Cardfight Vanguard I thought there were solid for the most part.First up we have Aichi\xa0 I\'m going, to be honest with you I really liked him a lot.Until Cardfight Vanguard all the card game protagonist he doesn\'t suffer from card game protagonist syndrome where they all overpowered and lucky throughout most of the game Aichi is a card game protagonist where he actually loses his matches quite a lot especially in the beginning as just a fairly vanguard player who has still had yet to truly come out from his shell. His character development and progression were very satisfying to watch as he is this weak kid who gets bullied and picks on for a living to this more confident person who is not improving his social skills but he also capable of fighting against the strongest players in the country. This is a card game anime done right as I getting tired of seeing theses overpowered card game protagonist simply winning by either getting too lucky or by a contrived Deus ex machina that the plot magically decided to pull out off its ass. Overall Aichi is a great character that I enjoyed from start to finish.Next, we have Kai and am going to be real honest I don\'t really care for him all the much especially in the beginning. He\'s not a bad character but the way he\'s portrayed in the plot was very cliche and boring. He\'s your typical overpowered character who lucksakes his way to victory where he hardly loses a cardfight. I may have a spot soft for overpowered characters in anime as along the set is self-aware of his overpowered as well be an interesting/ likeable character but Kai, for most of the shows run, is neither of these two things and as a result, Kai is a pretty weak character substance wise. However, I will give Kai this in the final 2 fifths of the show he becomes a much better character where more sympathetic as well having strong character development where he starts caring for his teammates. Despite that, he was a pretty decent character but at the same time, he could have been a lot better.Now we have my favourite character in the show Misaki. Out of all the characters in the show, she\'s the most developed of the bunch. She has a tragic backstory where she lost her parents in a car accident whereafter that car incident she became socially withdrawn to others especially to vanguard where it only brings out her worst memories that cause her physical pain. However, as the series progresses she starts to be more sociable where during the cardfight against a newcomer Emi aka Aichi\'s little sister she\'s stars to realise how fun vanguard really is as a game. I also feel like she was the most constantly relatable character in the show where her character flaws were better executed than Kai and Kamui as the show goes a great job at making us the viewer about all of her issues that she has to overcome. Her final fight in season 1 is the perfect example of this as she finally grows as a character who is not playing Vanguard. Awesome character well-done Busihiroad.Finally, we have Kamui and I have a love/hate relationship with this character. In the first half, he was stereotypical bro character who supports and cares for the protagonist well being. He was also pretty annoying as well he is the main cause of the bad comedy as well a contrived love junior love triangle that barely went anyway.While I didn\'t like him in the first half he due to his bratty Beauvoir the second half completely redeems him where not only he becomes a more mature kid but he a nicely told redemption character arc he completely redeem himself of all the actions that did in the first half such as arguing with Kai and leaving the team when the team needed him the most. This was one of the things I liked about this season. They took a character that would be in people character shitlist and did a 180 where he later transformed him a much likeable and relatable character who has character flaws. I really liked how the show closes his character arc where despite him losing the match against Tetsu in a final couple of episodes he proved that he has the right to play in a national level alongside with his teammates.The rest of the characters of Cardfight Vanguard were sadly pretty forgetful. Apart from Miwa, and at times Emi who were interesting and enjoyable, the side characters were not all that interesting as they feel like character stereotypes that we have seen before in card game animes in the past not to mention some of the side characters in the show were pretty annoying. Cough Nagisa and Katsumi.Overall the characters in Cardfight Vanguard were good but not great.Now we get to the weakest part of Cardfight Vanguard the visuals. Am going to be dead honest with you guys the visuals in Cardfight Vanguard were pretty lacklustre. The character designs may look good and appealing but that\'s not my problem with Cardfight Vanguard visuals am talking about the animation. Now I understand that card game anime was meant to be low budget as they meant to advertise the cards but I feel Cardfight Vanguard abuses it\'s low budget to a point where many of the scenes of the show are still frames, recycled footage and stiff movement. The saddest part about is that this show came out in 2011.The soundtrack is awesome as most of the songs were very memorable and iconic.Some of my favourite tracks include Rens, power,Kai\'s Theme, Kamui\'s theme, Misaka;\'s Theme, Despair, Battle of Psyqualia and Kai determination. On top of having a memorable soundtrack, I really adored how the tracks were directed in the anime as gives many key scenes from the anime more impact making the key scenes more memorable. The soundtrack was so good I downloaded all the songs on my computer and I actually play some of the tracks when I am cardfighting with friends.The first opening theme Vanguard"" by JAM Project (eps 1-33) is a pretty good song that fits the lighthearted strip tone of the first half.The second opening theme.\xa0Believe in my existence"" by JAM Project (eps 34-65) is in my top 30 favourite anime openings of all time.The ending themes, on the other hand, were not memorable minus ending 1 and 3.Now for sub vs dub. The sub from what I heard was pretty good but nothing too special. The dub is actually good. Yeah, it may start off cheesy where certain characters sounded a bit stiff but as the series progresses the characters improved to a point where gotten used to the roles. My favourite performance in the dub was Roger Rhodes as Ren, James Beach as Aichi and Carol Anne Day as Misaki. Unfortunately, thanks to Bushiroad awful business move the first season of Cardfight Vanguard has been blocked in countries such as USA/UK and some other places in the world however if want to watch it dubbed go to 9anime as it has the same dub that was released in 2012/2013.So after 6 years since my first watch of Cardfight Vanguard what do I think of it. Well, I think Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 has held up nicely over the years. It had some good intriguing theme exploration, the plot despite being predictable in the end was solid and the main characters were nicely developed. It, unfortunately, has some problems though. The comedy is unfunny,\xa0 the side characters apart from Miwa and at times Emi were pretty forgetful, the second half pacing wise was inferior to the first half and the production values were pretty lacklustre. Despite these flaws, I still find the first season of Cardfight Vanguard to be a pretty satisfying watch that I enjoyed.If you\'re looking for a card game anime that is grounded and easy to watch then I recommend Cardfight Vanguard Season 1. It may not be perfect but it\'s a pretty solid show that you should check out.8/10 just to see how it holds up as an anime without my late nostalgia for it. After re-watching 65 episodes of Cardfight Vanguard, I have to say this. Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 is a good anime, however, I don\'t think that the show is great as I use to as it has a lot of flaws that hurt the show quite a bit.The story follows a young timid boy named Aichi Sendou who is a had time socialising with his peers at school. The thing that kept him going in life was his rare card Blaster Blade which he received when he was a kid. It\'s an important rare card from ""Vanguard"", a card game with the imaginary world of ""Planet Cray"" as its stage. From the day he reunited with the person who gave him that card ""Toshiki Kai"", Aichi\'s everyday life began to change.The story of Cardfight Vanguard is pretty good but at the same time pretty flawed but for let\'s talk about the good starting with the first 2 episodes.This is easily the best first episode I have ever seen in a card game because not only does the show does a fantastic job at establishing the game itself as well it\'s characters, world-building and themes but it also a great job at drawing the audience in into the show. I loved how nicely paced where the first cardfight was as it nicely explained all the rules about the game itself making the viewer interested in buying the actual cards itself.The one thing that this show has over other card game anime is that the show is narratively grounded. Most of the dialogue, characters and even the cardfights were grounded where many scenes of the anime actually happen in real such as communication failure, misplaying, teammates looking out for each other when times at rough to even skill and luck that can put you into a winning side or a losing side.Out of all the card game anime that I have seen Cardfight Vanguard was the only card game anime that I was really infested in as most of the fights were won/loss by pure skill and luck rather than asspulling and Deus ex machina bullcrap that plagued Yugioh anime since 2000.Along with the shows, grounded feel comes in the show\'s world-building. I don\'t mean by city establishments but about the player diving into the hobby of card games where not the show a lot of realistic details such as having people open actual booster packs a tournament setting in a local shop where we spectators and players enjoying the game of Cardfight Vanguard as well a having an official national/regional tournaments that are professional in design and tone. This was easily the one thing that Cardfight Vanguard has over any other card game anime like Yugioh, Selector WIOXSS and Future Card Buddyfight and am glad the show put a lot of effort of making the life as a vanguard player feel very realistic and relatable.(Spoilers Ahead)Speaking of realistic Cardfight Vanguard least in season 1 by far the most realistic card game anime to ever exist as from start to finish the anime is very grounded in nature we see the highs and lows of set vanguard player, for example, Aichi, in the beginning, was a timid player who is not that good with game who often makes misplays just like a real new vanguard.However, the series progresses where after Aichi and the rest of Q4 lose they first nationals as well Kai giving him the motivation to get better Aichi starts to become a more confident fighter. However, due to Psyqualia Aichi starts to have a downward spiral where he almost completely himself as it starts being this cruel to not only his opponents where he completely slaughtered them in a Cardfight but his fellow teammates calling them weaklings.However, after Kai destroyed his Psyqualia winning spree Aichi starts to reflect off all the bad things he has done while he was consumed by Psyqualia and from there Aichi becomes a much better person where he doesn\'t rely on gifted power to win as being a loving caring person.(End Of Spoilers)Cardfight Vanguard biggest strength is how the show portrayed it\'s realistic portrayal it\'s themes that actually happen in real life. Themes of teamwork, commutation, redemption, regret, were beautifully explored in the anime as each of the 4 characters one of two of these them into they respective characters arcs that goes on in the story.Unfortunately, Cardfight Vanguard does have some flaws. The second half in pacing and at times quality times was inferior as the soon as Q4 loses the first national tournament the story starts to drag quite a bit where many of the episodes are just a repeat of the first half but with less charm put them for the most part. As much I love seeing Aichi using his Psyqualia to brutally destroy his opponents in cardfights I feel like the other content such as Team Q4 second journey of being the national champions to be pretty lacking until the final 5 of the series.Along with team Q4 second journey being less exciting compared to the first comes in the show predictably where almost every single cardfight in the second half seemed to have thick plot armour at various times competently ruins cardgames. I won\'t any of the cardfights as it will to big spoiler territory but all I say that I was a bit I was a bit upset when a more grounded card game anime such as this has deiced to take the predictable route that was for the most part not fun. This is stuff that I expect from Future Card Buddyfight and sure that show was a bit predictable but least that show was self-aware of itself plus team\xa0Balle du Soleil journey of winning the ABC and Gaen Cup were not a chore to watch compare to this.The biggest problem that I had with Cardfight Vanguard season 1 is Ren as well the poorly executed\xa0Psyqualia elements. Ren himself was a decent villain at as he simply to gather many skilled cardfighters under his leadership in Team Asteroid, however, thanks to a terrible line that Ren said in one episode he quickly devolved into this generic power-hungry villain who simply wanted to take over the world using his Psyqualia. It was a shame because I kinda liked him as a character.As for the Psyqualia elements it was okay in the beginning but the further the show progresses the less sense it make thanks to show subpar build up of it as it just came out of nowhere especially in the last 3 episodes as the show tried to make\xa0 Psyqualia more epic than it actually is but failed due to shotty directing as the show barely truly shows the true existence of Psyqualia enough for the viewer to care.Overall despite the flaws that I mentioned, I thought the story of Cardfight Vanguard to above average. It may have a lot of good things but at the same time, it has quite a bit of mediocre things that at various points hurts the show.When it comes to the characters in Cardfight Vanguard I thought there were solid for the most part.First up we have Aichi\xa0 I\'m going, to be honest with you I really liked him a lot.Until Cardfight Vanguard all the card game protagonist he doesn\'t suffer from card game protagonist syndrome where they all overpowered and lucky throughout most of the game Aichi is a card game protagonist where he actually loses his matches quite a lot especially in the beginning as just a fairly vanguard player who has still had yet to truly come out from his shell. His character development and progression were very satisfying to watch as he is this weak kid who gets bullied and picks on for a living to this more confident person who is not improving his social skills but he also capable of fighting against the strongest players in the country. This is a card game anime done right as I getting tired of seeing theses overpowered card game protagonist simply winning by either getting too lucky or by a contrived Deus ex machina that the plot magically decided to pull out off its ass. Overall Aichi is a great character that I enjoyed from start to finish.Next, we have Kai and am going to be real honest I don\'t really care for him all the much especially in the beginning. He\'s not a bad character but the way he\'s portrayed in the plot was very cliche and boring. He\'s your typical overpowered character who lucksakes his way to victory where he hardly loses a cardfight. I may have a spot soft for overpowered characters in anime as along the set is self-aware of his overpowered as well be an interesting/ likeable character but Kai, for most of the shows run, is neither of these two things and as a result, Kai is a pretty weak character substance wise. However, I will give Kai this in the final 2 fifths of the show he becomes a much better character where more sympathetic as well having strong character development where he starts caring for his teammates. Despite that, he was a pretty decent character but at the same time, he could have been a lot better.Now we have my favourite character in the show Misaki. Out of all the characters in the show, she\'s the most developed of the bunch. She has a tragic backstory where she lost her parents in a car accident whereafter that car incident she became socially withdrawn to others especially to vanguard where it only brings out her worst memories that cause her physical pain. However, as the series progresses she starts to be more sociable where during the cardfight against a newcomer Emi aka Aichi\'s little sister she\'s stars to realise how fun vanguard really is as a game. I also feel like she was the most constantly relatable character in the show where her character flaws were better executed than Kai and Kamui as the show goes a great job at making us the viewer about all of her issues that she has to overcome. Her final fight in season 1 is the perfect example of this as she finally grows as a character who is not playing Vanguard. Awesome character well-done Busihiroad.Finally, we have Kamui and I have a love/hate relationship with this character. In the first half, he was stereotypical bro character who supports and cares for the protagonist well being. He was also pretty annoying as well he is the main cause of the bad comedy as well a contrived love junior love triangle that barely went anyway.While I didn\'t like him in the first half he due to his bratty Beauvoir the second half completely redeems him where not only he becomes a more mature kid but he a nicely told redemption character arc he completely redeem himself of all the actions that did in the first half such as arguing with Kai and leaving the team when the team needed him the most. This was one of the things I liked about this season. They took a character that would be in people character shitlist and did a 180 where he later transformed him a much likeable and relatable character who has character flaws. I really liked how the show closes his character arc where despite him losing the match against Tetsu in a final couple of episodes he proved that he has the right to play in a national level alongside with his teammates.The rest of the characters of Cardfight Vanguard were sadly pretty forgetful. Apart from Miwa, and at times Emi who were interesting and enjoyable, the side characters were not all that interesting as they feel like character stereotypes that we have seen before in card game animes in the past not to mention some of the side characters in the show were pretty annoying. Cough Nagisa and Katsumi.Overall the characters in Cardfight Vanguard were good but not great.Now we get to the weakest part of Cardfight Vanguard the visuals. Am going to be dead honest with you guys the visuals in Cardfight Vanguard were pretty lacklustre.

The sub from what I heard was pretty good but nothing too special. The dub is actually good.

Heck, the whole show is a so bad that this small review is enough to roast this bad anime.Story 1/10The story is of little to no consequence. Some kid gets bullied, gets his favorite card stolen and then uses card fighting to get it back. Suddenly the people who bullied him become his best friends and he's no longer the loser of his class. They especially note this in the second episode where they point out that before he had his card fight, he was a ridiculous loser with no friends and never talking to...anyone, never being happy. Yup, worst story I've been in a long timeAnimation 2/10It's your Generic card fight animation. Flashy lights when cards are used, random spirits popping up left right and center, colorful hair for no reason other than to... actually, I don't know why.

In short, the animation is about as Generic as it getsSound 2/10There's not much to say. You don't really notice the sound. It doesn't help nor hinder the anime.

If there was a time when people enjoyed playing card games (like people enjoyed playing cards), then I saddeningly missed it.And then there\'s Cardfight Vanguard; which basically kicks it back to old school.

It was the first marketing vehicle anime I\'d watched where card games didn\'t decide the fate of the world. Then that changed when the series antagonist shows up. The show doesn\'t suffer tremendously, even weaving in a ""believe in your own power"" theme, but I still want a slice of life card game anime one day.ArtConsidering how recent this show is, the art quality rather lacking. The character designs are interesting, but the animation seems rather low budget. But since the show\'s still airing, I suppose they had to cut corners somewhere.SoundThe music really did...its job in setting the mood.

The rivalry between Kai and Aichi is actually unique compared to other anime with similar aspects and genre. They don't hate each other and Aichi aspires to be like Kai, so much that he falls down the wrong path before Kai sets him right. The plot itself is actually pretty unique and it's not based solely on tournaments or character development, there's a really nice...balance.The main character isn't 'OP' or the 'best at the game', he actually grows and learns the game and develops through his experiences throughout the anime. There isn't actually a cliché fight so far and despite it just being about a card game, it can really put you on the edge of your seat. Things aren't dragged out and a cardfight doesn't last several episodes, so you don't get bored and feel like skipping episodes until you find out the winner.Overall, for the story I give it a 10. All of the characters go through some sort of development process, none of them really have clichéd backstories that you can guess just by looking at the characters. The creators did really well to create a perfect balance with the characters' development and plot, as I mentioned previously. Arcs aren't so boringly long and it's not repetitive, you can't really guess what happens next. 'Vanguard' - the card game - is complex. I think they kinda overdid it with the rules and the riding/superior riding + triggers. Everything happens all at once and it's heavily RNG-based, unless of course you have the psyqualia. But that makes it even more interesting. If you're watching it to learn the game, you will have to look up the rules and do research online, either that or I'm just dense. Either way, I like it. It's unique, despite it's genre.For art, it's actually pretty good, a solid 9 from me. They have the typical crazy, gravity defying hair, but the animation style is something you can't get bored of or hurts your eyes. I really love the details they've done for the eyes, especially for psyqualia and just how they draw your attention and allow you to interpret character's emotions. It really adds to their personalities.Sound, there's not much to say. I love the opening/endingss, but I don't pay much attention to the OSTs playing in the back. Sometimes it can be repetitive with the sound, but tbh, that's normal. It gets an 8 from me, because I love the opening.The characters deserve an 8.5. So I'll round it up to 9. I'll say it now, Kai and Aichi are great. They're like rivals and best friends, and this only gets stronger throughout with each fight. Their friendship gets tested several times throughout which makes them stronger and play better. Team Q4 are great, including the 'manager'. The only issue with the characters are that Komui and Morikawa are obnoxious for the first 20 episodes and Misaki, one of the best and well developed characters IMO, is introduced later on and isn't given a purpose until like 30 episodes in. She's such a good character, yet she just isn't memorable. It kinda wasted great opportunities. Aichi isn't OP from the start. He doesn't actually know what he's doing. He learns the game and doesn't suddenly get good at the game, which is nice, it has great pacing and isn't boring because he's already the best.Enjoyment and overall, I give this a 9. The thing that lets it down the most is just that the sound isn't something that resonates and isn't memorable other than the opening and the issues with the characters which I mentioned.I love this show and even though I'm not yet finished with it, I know that I will love it til the very end. balance.The main character isn't 'OP' or the 'best at the game', he actually grows and learns the game and develops through his experiences throughout the anime.

Things aren't dragged out and a cardfight doesn't last several episodes, so you don't get bored and feel like skipping episodes until you find out the winner.Overall, for the story I give it a 10. All of the characters go through some sort of development process, none of them really have clichéd backstories that you can guess just by looking at the characters. The creators did really well to create a perfect balance with the characters' development and plot, as I mentioned previously. Arcs aren't so boringly long and it's not repetitive, you can't really guess what happens next. 'Vanguard' - the card game - is complex. I think they kinda overdid it with the rules and the riding/superior riding + triggers. Everything happens all at once and it's heavily RNG-based, unless of course you have the psyqualia. But that makes it even more interesting. If you're watching it to learn the game, you will have to look up the rules and do research online, either that or I'm just dense. Either way, I like it. It's unique, despite it's genre.For art, it's actually pretty good, a solid 9 from me. They have the typical crazy, gravity defying hair, but the animation style is something you can't get bored of or hurts your eyes. I really love the details they've done for the eyes, especially for psyqualia and just how they draw your attention and allow you to interpret character's emotions. It really adds to their personalities.Sound, there's not much to say. I love the opening/endingss, but I don't pay much attention to the OSTs playing in the back. Sometimes it can be repetitive with the sound, but tbh, that's normal. It gets an 8 from me, because I love the opening.The characters deserve an 8.5. So I'll round it up to 9. I'll say it now, Kai and Aichi are great. They're like rivals and best friends, and this only gets stronger throughout with each fight. Their friendship gets tested several times throughout which makes them stronger and play better. Team Q4 are great, including the 'manager'. The only issue with the characters are that Komui and Morikawa are obnoxious for the first 20 episodes and Misaki, one of the best and well developed characters IMO, is introduced later on and isn't given a purpose until like 30 episodes in. She's such a good character, yet she just isn't memorable. It kinda wasted great opportunities. Aichi isn't OP from the start. He doesn't actually know what he's doing. He learns the game and doesn't suddenly get good at the game, which is nice, it has great pacing and isn't boring because he's already the best.Enjoyment and overall, I give this a 9. The thing that lets it down the most is just that the sound isn't something that resonates and isn't memorable other than the opening and the issues with the characters which I mentioned.I love this show and even though I'm not yet finished with it, I know that I will love it til the very end."", ""Okay.. The reviews I've read so far are ALL hating this because of the similarities between yugioh (and other TCG anime)And by reading the other reviews you can make your own assumption on the animeBUTI'm going to review the TCG more than the anime.The anime isn't groundbreaking.. Again, it's like any other TCG anime.. But the TCG itself Is really interesting. I read somewhere that the anime is only a promotional tool for the card game and it maybe But It's a unique game but at the same time feels similar to other great games. Which makes it easier to get into.It has a unique...monsters only type've gameplay, (so no spells or traps or anything) but monsters have certain abilities and things called Drive Trigger (kind've like the Shield Triggers in Duel Masters) to influence the match in various ways.The ratings I have given are based on the anime and NOT the TCG itself. If I had to give a rating for the TCG i would've given it a higher rating! But that isn't the case!If you want to watch a new TCG based anime to get into something new, then i suggest you watch.

The fact that the good guys can actually lose important games on this serie is really, really fascinating to my tastes.Art: 9/10I cannot give a lot...of in depths here as I can only judge based on my personal tastes: I find the character design ok and cards are interesting enough to watch them episode after another.

It was really frustrating to try learn the game at first.

Me? I've watched 27 episodes of this anime and I love it a lot. Ahem.Allow me to review everything.Story (7)It's not super amazing and it doesn't really have a plot aside from the mystery of the power of the cards. I dunno it myself, but that really caught my interest. I love how the Vanguard game is played. The rules are interesting and I hope it gets brought out here to the USA so I can play it myself. Also, I like this anime a lot better than Yugioh. Yeah....I went there. The score coulda been higher, but I don't like how Aichi continues looking for Kai and being sorta obsessed with him. However, I like how the series are progressing and hope to see if it gets better.Art (10)The art REALLY attracted me to this anime. I love the designs, especially the cards. There are a variety of appealing cards compared to YGO. The colors aren't dull and I love the animation. Need I say more?Sound (10)I love the OP and ED themes. They're on my iPod and they're addicting. I haven't heard a song I didn't like yet either. The music really matches the anime. I am pleased.Character (8)Gave them an 8 because of their designs and personalities. Coulda been a higher score, but Aichi is short like Yugi..Sorta like his personality as well.Kai = Kaiba? Um. Except he's more of a jerk. I know the YGO creator coulda been more creative. I love Misaki. She has a sad back story.

I had my first brush with the anime a few years ago, and it just didn't pull me in, and because of this, I had brushed it off as an anime I did not think I would enjoy. I have never been happier to be wrong. I can honestly say that this anime deserved a second chance, not only by me, but for any fan of TCGs.Being a long time fan and player of Yu-Gi-Oh!, the differences seemed almost too much. Game play seemed very simple and that...left the impression that the anime would be very boring as a result. This could not be further from the truth! Having followed Aichi Sendou from his humble beginnings; witnessing his growth, lack of confidence and eventual success has made the experience more enjoyable. The character who I connect with the most is Misaki.Misaki has an Eidetic Memory, meaning she has perfect recall from events that she has witnessed, including Vanguard Fights. Having great recall of memories and events myself, just like the character, I can come off as cold or aloof. Her story is truly transformative, allowing her to not only socially evolve and grow; her complex emotional struggles are laid bare before the viewer and other characters, giving rise to her reason for finally deciding to participate in Vanguard fights and tournaments.In true Otaku fashion, the show has inspired me to pick up the Cardfight!! Vanguard game in earnest. I spend the majority of my free time reading about the different clans, their role on the planet Cray and the focus of the different archetypes and subtypes in actual play. I have spent much more than I initially thought I would, procuring trial decks and singles, but that is part of the fun. When I compare it to the excitement it has awakened in me, these Cards, as well as the series, are true treasures.I will be starting a Blog in the coming weeks, chronicling my journey with Vanguard. I hope it inspires others, along with this review, to give Vanguard a try. You will be pleasantly surprised where your imagination can take you. The visuals the anime gives you are just points of reference, and I encourage you to allow yourself to fully visualize the Planet Cray yourself. This anime is a gift to anyone who needs their imaginative side reawakened. I hope it takes you all to new heights, especially during the bleak times we find ourselves in. May it give you hope for a better tomorrow. left the impression that the anime would be very boring as a result. This could not be further from the truth!

Vanguard (CFV) is an anime based on the eponymous trading card game and revolves around protagonist Aichi Sendou and his experiences with the game.There is not much to say about the content of the series except for ""card games"". CFV presents to us a normal world where card games are all the rage, and are a large focus of people\'s lives. The events which occur in the series are repetitive, monotonous and predictable.There is a notable defying of certain devices which are commonly used in other anime series, especially ones based on card games. While CFV does not focus on deconstructing the card game...genre, this makes the anime interesting to watch. The effects of chance, supernatural powers and character interactions are represented more realistically and are worth paying attention to when the focus diverts from the card game once in a blue moon.The presentation of CFV is slightly above average. Fights between units in the card game are animated very nicely, but the music is nothing of note.Overall, Cardfight!! Vanguard is a somewhat thinly-veiled attempt at advertising a card game, but is still somewhat enjoyable due to good animation and subversions of devices often used in other animes. genre, this makes the anime interesting to watch.

I couldn\'t understand what the...fuck was happening, though the whole card gameplay does seem a bit interesting.So in Vanguard the main rules are: you imagine that you\'re in a world fighting against your opponent with cards.

I'd give the Story a 6/10. There's very little nuance and everything is very laid out for you, as well as Aichi starting as basically a god of the game after only playing a few times was very immersion-breaking. In the original series, Aichi, for the first few games, is complete ass. And that is great, because it makes...it feel much more real and grounded as opposed to this now where he's kind of just at the level of a worlds winner after MAYBE a week, whereas most real worlds winners have played for years.The art, is pretty good (8/10). There's nothing really wrong with the art and the character models do look really good. My only gripe would be that the backgrounds like PAINFULLY average, and they really contrast the characters in terms of quality. There are exceptions, like the river scene when Aichi is the big sad, god that river looks amazing, and most actual games look great, but outside of that the backgrounds really distract me from thinking it looks necessarily amazing.The sound is pretty mediocre. (5/10). The OP is great, the ED is alright, I guess? Most of the sound design is boring and uninspired, but there are a few nice tracks here and there. Not a COMPLETE drought but not an overall great soundtrack.The characters are.. alright (5/10). They're definitely not bad, and Kai's backstory adds a lot more to HIS character, but Aichi and Ren's character and duality were butchered in terms of quality. Psychi is underrepresented, Ren is more of a copypaste bad guy with not nearly enough time to develop and the story kind of just assumes you've seen the original before they talko no jutsu him into being friends which feels extremely unnatural and a far cry from the original.I really did enjoy this series (8/10), as a fan of the Card Game, watching the characters play it and being able to follow and understand what they're doing makes it a lot of fun for me as an individual, not that it really affects it's overall quality.Overall, I'd give this show a 7/10. There's interesting ideas and the bombastic and over-the-top duels feel alive and like they're happening right in front of you but the show's story really drags down the ship. it feel much more real and grounded as opposed to this now where he's kind of just at the level of a worlds winner after MAYBE a week, whereas most real worlds winners have played for years.The art, is pretty good (8/10).

No personaly the only things I see these two anime have in common is that both focuss on a cardgame and have a shy protagonist who later starts to becomes confident aside of this two are different because while yugioh focuss...a lot to the supernatural vanguard starts to have a bit more slice of life style for the biggest part of it.The first half of the anime focuss on show you which are the rules of the game and it do this well it shows how to built a deck and it introduces you to the cardgame by showing you the rules the difference between decks and etc.That's really good because it shows that it's a ballanced anime which it shows you the game without becomes an advertisement with episodes something that not a lot cardgames anime sucseed also there are no fillers because even them introduces a new deck or a new strategy of an old clan even the second part which focuss more to supernatural it stillenjoyable. ART: The animation is just ok. SOUND: the music is ok voice actors are really good and I talk about the dub since I have seen only this version.CHARACTER: The characters are really good some of them are really intreasting like Ren or Misaki.

Later on they do get into the SAVE THE WORLD WITH CARD GAME however this first season specifically is really nice to go back to every so often just to see the absolute wonder that grows in these characters as they get better at the game and take on locals."", 'This is a YuGiOh (YGO) style anime (made by the same people, has the same character archetypes, and even has a few subtle references to that show), meaning it is made just to promote a card game. At the same time it is very different that YuGiOh and in a way tries to deconstruct the formula in order to create a more realistic overall. And guess what, this is exactly what makes it so lame. Although I was never a huge fan of the older franchise but did appreciate the cool presentation. And yes, I did have the motivation to learn how to play the...game thanks to the anime. Vanguard on the other hand is far from cool and quickly loses its glamour. There is no better way to explain what I mean than to keep comparing these two anime, showing where one succeeded and the other failed.1) YGO was the first major card game promoting series and for that it had created a sensation. Afterwards, the novelty faded (since a dumb idea can only work once) and the later seasons, as well as other anime that tried to copy its success, simply didn’t work. And to no surprise Vanguard is not a hit either.2) YGO and especially its first version which never went overseas, was very dark and creepy. It had all sorts of occult overtones to the point many parents thought it was initiating their kids to Satanism. They obviously watered down the atmosphere with each new season in order to calm down the adults and to increase the age advisory to the point their latest shows seems completely tamed and easy-going. Well unfortunately for them this is exactly what made it so cool to watch. It was full of occult stuff; demons and devils and satanic rituals. The kids loved it as much as the parents hated it. And thus you get Vanguard that is plain childish and boring. No evil charm to it.3) YGO had a plot where defeat would mean some really scary and creepy stuff. Your body would be shred to pieces, your soul would be trapped in limbo, hell would break loose on Earth, the planet would blow up, evil would rule the universe, and someone would kick a puppy. Vanguard doesn’t have that sort of looming threat as defeat means nothing more than trying to learn from your mistakes and improving along the way. As mature as that sounds, it is far from cool and the target audience is little kids who want cool stuff.4) Although both shows have a very similar weak/pathetic geek as a protagonist, the one in YGO had a cool dark personality that was taking over his body and unleashing all sorts of awesome powers upon its enemies. Vanguard is nothing like that; the geek remains a geek all the way. Although he also has a sort of dark personality too, it is just a minor side story and it is meant to be scary and hidden away instead of us saying how cool it is. So we are supposed to hope the dork remains a dork and his cool dark powers never come out? Seriously? Lame!5) Hairstyles! YGO had some really crazy cool ones. Vanguard does not.6) The monsters of YGO were early on presented as creatures from ancient Egypt or demons from hell who constantly try to get to our world and trash everything. That was cool. The ones in Vanguard are presented like aliens who are at war on their planet but otherwise can’t and don’t want to have anything to do with our planet. Lame!7) The players of YGO hardly use copies of the same monster in a duel, unless of course they need two or three of the same kind in order to do some cool strategy. In Vanguard they summon the same monsters again and again, as if there are only a few dozen different cards in each deck. This makes it both boring as well as trashing the illusion of each monster being a special individual.8 ) The monsters in YGO were appearing in battles through holographic projectors and later on in the flesh. In Vanguard, none of those cool things happen. You are supposed to IMAGINE them fighting. I am not kidding you, you are literally supposed to imagine you are on the alien planet, imagine the monsters fighting, imagine them hitting you, and imagine that losing a duel has some sort of serious significance in your life. The only thing I imagine when I am doing that is BULL SHIT! Just show it to us you idiots; this is not literature, it is an animated show for kids.9) YGO had the very convenient but otherwise cool plot devise of “Heart of the Cards”. Every time you were about to lose, if you had faith in your abilities you would magically draw the only card that could possibly save you in a one in a billion chance. And that would be followed by a very cool display of MY CARDS WILL NOW KICK YOUR ASS! In Vanguard you don’t get that feeling. It’s like you are supposed to draw cards and hope you will trigger a counter BY COMPLETE CHANCE! That is not cool at all. It doesn’t even have a cool name for an otherwise convenient plot device.10) As a follow up to the above, the very Vanguard game is hardly as exciting as YGO. In YGO you were made to think you were using a strategy since the very beginning. For example, trap cards you set from your hand would remain hidden on the battlefield so the opponent would have no way to guess how you are planning to own his ass. And at any time you have clear knowledge of how you plan to activate those said cards or the opponent could through various means cancel them before they are activated. This was creating both a sense of control as well as building tension to see how the whole thing will play out. Well you hardly get this in Vanguard because you can’t plan ahead your strategy. Every time you attack or defend, you draw cards and just HOPE they will give you triggers. That’s right; there is no way to know if it works or not. This makes the whole thing to feel very random and chaotic.There are of course some elements that make Vanguard a lot more mature than YGO and I will mention them here as means to give it the credit it deserves.1) Vanguard is not about winning but about learning from your mistakes. Thus the protagonist is losing many, many times throughout the show. Although this is hardly as cool as in the SUPER AWESOME YAMI YUGI WHO NEVER LOSES at the same time you see how he is supposed to improve along the way by trying new strategies and cards.2) Vanguard has actually some capable female players in it. Unlike in YGO where they are used mostly as fan service and are completely useless in card games, over here you get some seriously good gals who know how to kick ass. That makes it more respectable to the female audience.3) Vanguard is following the rules of the real game correctly. That is, no mambo-jumbo stuff that does not happen when you play the real game. Let’s be honest, YGO was barely following the proper rules and was just making up stuff just for the sake of coolness.4) The whole show is JUST about card games. Not about saving the world by playing a children’s card game. Sounds lame, but also more realistic at the same time. The characters are trying to get better, in courage, planning, social life, wisdom, awareness, and lots of other stuff by playing this game. Ok, they of course overdo it in the way this is supposed to work but it is otherwise shown properly.And despite the above positive remarks, the show is still not as good. As sad as it sounds, the target audience will not be inspired to go buy the game if it looks so real. If little kids watch a protagonist who loses half the time, they will think the game sucks. If they see good female players in it, they will think it’s gay. They won’t care much if the rules are presented properly as they would if the battles are cool. And no, the battles are not cool because you are not trying to save the world with a bunch of cards. It is plain entertainment 101 here and an anime is supposed to be entertaining first and educational second.Ok, let me now talk a bit about more abstract stuff that I felt about this anime. First of all, I hardly liked Vanguard as a game. I did bother to go learn it but it far from exciting. You are not given the feeling of epicness coming out of it, since most of the time you are replacing monsters instead of feeling you are empowering them to something better. You don’t have 8000 AWESOME LIFE POINTS, you just have 6 cards of life. No matter how powerful your attack is, you only normally inflict 1 card worth of damage. You don’t set traps to use in a later round but draw cards the moment you attack or defend and HOPE you will get a trigger. You can’t mix cards from different clans very well because synergy is overused to the point the number of strategies you can use is limited. Even the number of available cards felt very small but that had to do with YGO airing several years after its release instead of what Vanguard did, when the game was still new and with a small amount of different cards.I also am too old now to get into the whole card game madness as easily as I did about a decade ago. It was so easy to do so back when I only had Pokemon, YGO or Digimon to watch or play but after all these years the constant sequels and spin-offs have saturated the genre to the point I don’t care much. Even when Vanguard tried to change the formula, I still didn’t feel it was doing much to improve it past its nasty trappings. In fact, it felt worse than before.And for last I say… IMAGINE??? Really now. IMAGINE??? People don’t watch anime to imagine anything. They watch to be handed over a concept they are supposed to take at face value or analyze with what they feel or know. Vanguard doesn’t do any of those things. The rules are set out clearly, the concept is way too simple, there is nothing to think or feel about it. It… just… is.… And it’s for kids. It doesn’t have emo lolis, incest, lesbians, gore, or whatever other crap sells a billion bucks these days and makes people to consider them mature and thought provoking (I am joking but it’s sadly true for most). So no, there is nothing to see here. It is way too saturated and way too simple and way too real for its own good. Not recommended.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 5/10Analysis: General Artwork 1/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 1/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 1/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10VERDICT: 4/10 game thanks to the anime.

Blue Gender,https://myanimelist.net/anime/58/Blue_Gender,"[""Blue Gender is one of those series that a lot of people overlook or brush off for some reason. Many assume that it's just a depthless ripoff of Starship Troopers. However, in the process they're missing out on a substantially underrated and mature series that deserves more recognition.Story: The initial idea, I must admit, isn't very original. Giant bugs VS. human beings has been done many times over, but this isn't the entire focus of Blue Gender. A variety of locations, plotlines and situations are introduced, the vast majority of them well developed. A wide range of issues related to maturation, bonding, dealing with...death/violence and mankind's self-destructive nature are explored, and the political intrigue in the latter half of the series is also a nice touch.Art: Probably the weakest part of the series. While the gritty character designs are appropriate, the art often dips into noticeably distorted bad spots and is, honestly, a little bland. Don't expect too much in the animation department either, except for more important action scenes.Sound: The music in Blue Gender ranges from the catchy OP, to the ambient (and often somewhat unsettling) background music throughout each episode, to the understated and beautiful ED. Overall, very good.Character: One of the best points of the series. Even minor characters are given a considerable degree of background and personality, and the leads develop to a significant extent as they gain new experiences and face new trials. I felt that the characters behaved realistically, had understandable motivations and had more depth than those in most other series I've seen. In addition, the matter of relationships (and sex) is handled in a refreshing way that is, in most cases, tasteful.Enjoyment/Overall: Blue Gender is an action-packed, frightening and ultimately great series. It should be noted that it is rather violent, regularly deals with disturbing topics and, at many points, tells a rather morose and bleak story. However, within this melancholy framework is something that is poignant, intriguing and worthy of praise. I would highly recommend Blue Gender to anyone mature enough to handle it, and to those that want a series that explores some of the darker aspects of humanity and its role in the universe. death/violence and mankind's self-destructive nature are explored, and the political intrigue in the latter half of the series is also a nice touch.Art: Probably the weakest part of the series.

It's a stroy thats been told before, but Blue Gender dose a much better job of doing so, with it chracters, and over all stroy line. It's these two major things that set it apart from the rest.STORY- A man awakens 12-years after being put in a state of suspended animation to find that the earth has been over run by giant bugs know only as the Blue. He is resuced...and taken back to mankinds last safe haven called second earth which is a sapce station. Their he disocvers that he has the power to destroy the Blue and take back the Earth in order to save humanity.ART- The art of the show is not the best, but very well done. It is done in a style that is remanicent of the Gundam Wing series, and is an older form of animation. The type not typicaly seen in newer animes, but don't let that get you down, because as I said before its still done very well.SOUND- The music of Blue Gender is very good, the opening theme is one that will stick in your head, and the use of music is done very well and in the right spots to help set the tone and pace of the series.CHARACTERS- This is where Blue Gender really shines. The differnt chacerts that are introduced through out the series are the ones with the most human aspect that I think I have ever seen in an anime series. They have their veiws about life and love and humanity as a whole, and the way they adapt and change through out the series is done very well. You can help but get involed with them due to these human aspects that we all feel.ENJOYMENT- This is a 26 episode series that I finished in a matter of days, I was glued to the screen wanting to see what was going to happen next. Its a more mature anime series due mainly to the dialog and violance, but those are things that I didn't really notice too much, beacuse they are typical everyday human behaviors, which is another reason way I loved this anime series so much was the human elemnt that they brought to the series.OVERALL- WOW! this seires was amazing, if you've heard about it and have'nt seen it, then put it on your list of things to watch very soon, you won't regret it. If you've never heard of Blue Gender and want to see an anime with great characters, and a compelling story, then this is the one for you.

Maybe it's because I didn't expect much heading into it, but like I said...very enjoyable.For any of you who have seen the movie Starship Troopers, there are quite a few similar elements in Blue Gender. Despite our staggering intelligence and development, mankind is getting owned by some huge bug-like monsters. The difference here is that the bugs have already taken over Earth, forcing a small proportion of our population to flee to an orbiting space station. However, all hope is not lost since mankind is initiating an operation to...retake our glorious planet. At the heart of this mission are people called &quot;sleepers&quot; and enter our main character.We follow Kaido Yuji as he wakes up to a post apocalyptic Earth and follow the poor guy as he is dragged along a harrowing gauntlet of bloodshed toward a shuttle to escape into space...and that's really only the prologue. The feeling you get watching Blue Gender is similar to Starship Troopers. The battlefield is chaotic, the enemy seems unstoppable, and soldiers are being ripped apart by the dozens. However, unlike Starship Troopers, this show's storyline goes much deeper, has a much darker feel, and definitely delivers more than just gory action.Anyone who enjoys raw brutality and violence surely won't be disappointed and there's even a damn good story behind it. I think the only reason I can't give it a 10 has to do with the characters. I personally never really connected with any of them though this is no wonder since the majority of them die without warning. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the easily depressed. Just a fair warning :)) retake our glorious planet.

Just a fair warning :))"", ""[Spoiler Warning]I don't know what to make of this series.I honestly really liked the first part. The series begins with the main character Yuji waking up into a post apocalyptic world after being retrieved by a recovery squad. They try to get to a spaceship, while facing some difficulties along the way, and finally make their way to Second Earth. That part of the series was utterly satisfying. It had a relatively diverse cast, some good action and the episodes always contained something new and interesting.After the characters get to second earth though, the show slows down a bit. There is a lot of political...intrigue, which is a nice change from the previous episodes, but while there are actually things happening it always feels like you know what is going to come next. After a while, you get used to it though and you just watch what is going to happen. The culmination of the second half is quite nicely done as well. The series could have stopped where it was, would have left quite a lot of questions and it would have been fine.However, the last 4 episodes, the quality of the show just goes downhill like a landslide. The storyline falters a bit, the leader of the good guys apparently decides their enemy was right and becomes the bad guy and worst, there suddenly has to be a whole lot more meaning behind the story. That frustrates me.There were quite a lot of very satisfying options to end the show, but the writers apparently decided to go with a really bad one in which the earth is intelligent and want to eradicate a lot of humans so that the remaining humans might live in harmony with nature aga... blablabla. If the rest of the show had conveyed a message like that, I wouldn't mind, but it didn't. Besides, it wasn't subtle.I would recommend this show to anyone who likes scifi or a post apocalyptic setting, doesn't mind a bit of gore and blood (which due to the quality of the animation, is never really unsettling) or just likes mecha's.I just didn't like the way it all ends.A 7. intrigue, which is a nice change from the previous episodes, but while there are actually things happening it always feels like you know what is going to come next.

The storyline falters a bit, the leader of the good guys apparently decides their enemy was right and becomes the bad guy and worst, there suddenly has to be a whole lot more meaning behind the story. That frustrates me.There were quite a lot of very satisfying options to end the show, but the writers apparently decided to go with a really bad one in which the earth is intelligent and want to eradicate a lot of humans so that the remaining humans might live in harmony with nature aga... blablabla. If the rest of the show had conveyed a message like that, I wouldn't mind, but it didn't. Besides, it wasn't subtle.I would recommend this show to anyone who likes scifi or a post apocalyptic setting, doesn't mind a bit of gore and blood (which due to the quality of the animation, is never really unsettling) or just likes mecha's.I just didn't like the way it all ends.A 7."", 'The main themes and story in Blue Gender are grim and handled with more maturity than most anime, and that alone is enough to give it praise. Unfortunately the pacing is also very slow and mostly episodic, thus it’s hard for most to go through it, especially today when most anime fans prefer shameless fantasy isekai over depressing sci-fi.The art quality ain’t bad at all. The animators went for realism instead of flash thus the weaponry feels fairly realistic despite including bulky mecha. That tends to make most battles to feel slow or simple, although the goal was always a down to earth approach instead...of spectacle. It depicts better themes of survival and existential horror when the heroes can’t solo armies using broken powers. And boy, does this anime excel at atmosphere.The setting is post-apocalyptic, with most of mankind having been exterminated by grotesque monsters and their corpses having been turned into big green meatballs, sort of food storages for the monsters. Most cities now look like giant bee hives and the streets are filled with said meatballs, full of faces writhing in agony on them. It will give you the chills. The surviving humans are actually affected by all this. Have you noticed how in most anime the characters act happy-go-lucky no matter how grim their world looks like? Like, there is always a high school and cosplayers and beach episodes even if the whole world has gone to hell? They have no touch with reality. Blue Gender is not one of those anime because all its characters are cynical, pessimistic and do not act like typical harem leads in some school comedy. Their faces are expressionless, devoid of hope, and they even have sex in random moments with random people just to feel they are alive.Obviously, the number one reason for that is because the demographic the show is aiming for is seinen (adult males) instead of children who still like Naruto and Spy Family. But there is more to that, since most moe anime are also seinen and they are nothing like Blue Gender. There are erotic scenes and numerous gruesome deaths of major characters, and they don’t feel like they are done just for edgy schlock entertainment in the likes of Akame Ga Kill or Mirai Nikki. They mostly respect the viewer and exist to serve the narrative instead of destroying it with crap like fan service or comic relief.With that said, the grim atmosphere of the setting overlaps most of the appeal of the characters, since the latter are almost average people with no broken superpowers. Even the special ones with the blue cells aren’t supermen. So it can be hard to bond with the cast, especially when they seem to have stopped caring anymore and turned into cynical materialists who just eat, fuck, and die. There is character growth for the major characters, by the way. One learns to deal with reality, another finds hope by falling in love, a third one embraces who he is meant to be, and so on. It’s just that they will be mostly overshadowed by the imposing sceneries of the bug-infested world.There is also a bit of mystery concerning the origin of the bugs and how they correlate with the once-sick main characters, although the answers will be mostly for the heck of having a twist near the end than for developing the themes any further. The pro-ecology angle of Blue Gender is one of its weakest aspects.The biggest issue is the run-down budget on animation which makes a lot of scenes to feel stiff and dull to look at for long. It is not something you can’t excuse if you have accepted it’s mostly about the atmosphere than the action, but newer anime watchers who were spoiled by shows like Demon Slayer will have a hard time staying focused for long. That aside, Blue Gender is a good anime that was unfortunately never given much attention because it came out at a time when Cowboy Bebop and Trigun were the gold standards. The industry moving away from dark sci-fi in favor of silly school romcoms and isekai made it even harder to recommend, especially when the plot is slow and semi-fillerish, while the characters are mostly un-relatable. If, though, you are in a mood for super slow and super depressing anime, this one is one of the best B-grade series of the 90s. of spectacle.

If, though, you are in a mood for super slow and super depressing anime, this one is one of the best B-grade series of the 90s.', ""Welcome back, to horror anime month. This week we look at another anime that wasn't based on anything but was an original work. From AIC studios, the same people who brought us such fails as Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari and OreImo, such decencies as Viper's Creed and Quiz Magic Academy and such goodies as Sasameki Koto and Vampire Princess Miyu. Since their work quality has such a wide range I can't even give a good estimate about how this we'll turn out. Let's take a look at Blue Gender and find out.Our story begins in 2009 with Kaido Yuji being put in Cryogenic Suspension...for a strange condition that the doctor's hope to find a solution for before reawakening him. Remember when we developed that technology, froze all those people and completely forgot about all of it? That was a crazy year. He wakes up in 2031 to find that giant insect creatures called the Blue have over-run the Earth and a team of soldiers is under orders to bring him into space, for very stupid reasons. The first half focuses on their efforts to reach the space stations referred to as Second Earth and may Red Shirts lose their lives. The second half focuses on the battle against the Blue and many more Red Shirts lose their lives. You can probably guess some of the story flaws, but I'll extrapolate on most of them. The first problem is that the series is set too close chronologically. The earliest events take place a decade after the series started airing. Using technology we still aren't close to having. What was the point of setting it so soon? It just makes the series dated really quickly. You'd think they could have set it in the “not too distant future” without giving an actual date and it would have worked much better. By the way, the Blue are scheduled to appear in four years for those of you who like predicting the end of the world. I can't really go into the reason that they have to bring Yuji to second Earth without giving spoilers, so I'll just say it fails basic Biology and leave it at that. Another issue is the Blue's motivation. Once you learn it you will get a migraine from the sheer idiocy of it. I'm tempted to spoil it just to rant about it, but I will restrain myself. Then there's the ending. It follows one of the dumbest, oldest cliches in existence. The cliched nature of the series is a problem in general, but at no point is it worse than the ending. The series itself seems to be afraid of trying anything new. Every plot element seems to have been decided based on what a very generic sci-fi work would do which just serves to make the whole thing trite and predictable. The horror doesn't really work. There are scenes where they're obviously trying, but the attempts are just ineffective.Then we have the characters. The only two important characters are Yuji and Marlene. Virtually everyone else is just a Red Shirt or they'll serve one basic purpose before being relegated to Red Shirt. That brings me to the biggest problem with the characters. There are a lot of deaths in this and they never give you any reason to care. “That character who was in all of two scenes and did nothing is dead.” Yet the series treats them as important and emotional, spending an absurd amount of time on some of them. Blue Gender, if you want your audience invested in your characters, you have to actually develop them a little. Otherwise it just seems like you're padding the series out by dwelling on the deaths of completely pointless characters. Even Yuji and Marlene are pretty dull. Yuji is your standard action hero. He starts out completely out of his element, but he adapts and becomes the big hero that everyone needs all without ever finding a developed personality to call his own. Marlene is more of your action girl who starts out tough but will get relegated to a background role when the plot calls for Yuji to take over. It doesn't help that Yuji is completely ungrateful. There are two cases in which his life is saved and he gets mad at the people or person responsible. It doesn't make him more developed or interesting, it just makes him annoying.The art is pretty good. The Blue look interesting and the backgrounds are pretty vibrant, except when they're in space and they become kind of monotonous, but that does make some sense. The action sequences could have been good, except that they interrupt the action a lot to show random reaction shots. Because when someone sees one of their comrades killed we couldn't guess that they'd be angry. We have to see it. Another issue is with the facial expressions. They frequently just look borked and convey no real emotion.The voice acting is good, considering that the actors have very little emotional depth to work with. The performances are still competent and they did get some good actors such as Nojima Kenji Kuwashima Houko and Nishimura Chinami. The music is really good. Whether they're trying to be scary, doing an action scene or whatever, the music could have been used in something that was doing it right.The Ho-yay factor is a 4/10. There are two sex scenes between a couple of the generic female characters. They serve absolutely no purpose and I have no idea why they were included, but they're there.So, that was Blue Gender. How does it hold up when taken as a whole? It isn't bad, but it's certainly not good. It's too cliché and generic. Every sci-fi element can be found in much better works, but they can also be found in much worse. In the end it's just a mediocre work that's relatively inoffensive. You might like it if you're a huge sci-fi fan and don't care about originality or if you're new to sci-fi and don't know the cliches yet. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with it. Final rating, 5/10. Next week, horror anime month continues with a look at Danganronpa. for a strange condition that the doctor's hope to find a solution for before reawakening him.

Next week, horror anime month continues with a look at Danganronpa."", 'Anime Review No.10Blue Gender is an anime not very well known by many because of its dark and mature content which most anime fans stay’s away and especially because the anime is an old 90’s anime. Blue Gender is closely related to the popular western title “Starship Troopers” which I gladly enjoy during my childhood but Blue Gender is different because unlike the western title which is set in an interstellar and out of this world action battle “Blue Gender” took in a pass apocalyptic event where the earth human population is in near extinction by the menacing gigantic insects called “Blues”. The remaining humans...take refuge in huge space stations which they called “Second Earth”. The anime have great concepts that most people failed to notice.Read my entire Overview of “Blue Gender” to find more details.Warning!  The Review will purely contain spoilers just to explain how well made the anime is.Plot (9/10)I will admit this purely by myself  the concept humans fighting against giant bugs is already establish by multiple movies and anime series but unlike those former series “Blue Gender” have executed the plot  in a very expanded way you will really feel the Apocalyptic damage the bugs have manifest because of the world building the anime provides. The anime is mature for the atmosphere of the show is scary, creepy and at the same time depressing. The creepy atmosphere adds up the tension.The near extinction of the human raise make sense in the plot for the course of the episode it is explained that the “Blues” started as non-treat to humans so the government didn’t bother to act but as time goes on the “Blues” evolved and increase in numbers. The “Blues” overwhelm the human population as the monsters evolve to resist the human weapons making them harder to kill and as the government use up all the advance technology they can use against the blues, it ended up human slowly losing against the blues and the human extinction began.The plot contain random sex scenes which is very unpleasant to people, who doesn’t tolerate ecchi scenes, but that also adds up to the story maturity and for the record almost all the characters in the story are adults without any source of entertainment in the time of war and sexual morality doesn’t exist anymore when civilization is now demolish.The plot is slow for it will took you a few episodes to know accordingly what’s going on and understand the objective of the entire series but rest assure all the information needed for you to understand will be given 1 by 1. I like how they made the events slow for it provided room for character development and also it add interest on the viewers to what can happen next. Blue Gender is an anime original so it’s impossible to know beforehand what can happen next. The events of the show make sense but I am not going to push forward about the plot to spoil you guys. Watch the anime to find out.Characters (9/10)The series focus on the 2 main characters named Kaido, Yuji, the male protagonist that lived before the events of the apocalypse, and Angel, Marlene, the female soldier protagonist that was sent on a mission to bring the sleepers to second earth. The characters at first are not likeable but the character development in the long run did the best in fleshing them out to be well executed characters. “Spoiler” Marlene and Yuji relationship progress as the series moves forward.The side characters in the first half of the series are not introduced for the obvious reason spoiler “they die” and not in a heroic way but a realistic way in combat like accident or getting fatally hit by “Blues”. As Yuji and Marlene travel to reach the nearest space port for them to reach second earth they met different people with different ideals that make the world building good for both the plot progression and character development.In the 2nd half of the story we are introduce to the people of in “Second Earth” that portray the politic aspects of the show and reveal more about Yuji sickness condition and his importantance in reclaiming the earth from the “Blues”.In 2nd half of the series a major change in personality in the 2 main characters will be seen in the ff.\uf0e0 Marlene Angel develops human emotion of caring and cherishing someone dear to her. From a cold soldier who lives to follow orders of her superior, she develops the personality to follow her own will as a living human being.\uf0e0 Marlene develop a heart to care for other people and her comrades which she doesn’t do when she haven’t met Yuji. Yuji thought Marlene how to truly live as human being.\uf0e0 Yuji become more adept in fighting the blues but loses his own soft personality and became bloodthirsty.\uf0e0 Yuji and Marlene relationship progress saving Yuji in the process of going insane.This what I love about Blue Gender in terms of character build up you feel that the characters are not rush and progress slowly but surely.Music (10/10)""Tokihanate!"" by Houko Kuwashima a song that is both creepy and mood lighting. The opening portrays the apocalyptic part and war of the anime that give the viewer the interest to watch it and nothing more to say. The background music give the creepy atmosphere which make the show horrifically mature in presentation. The last music the wonderful music title ""Ai Ga Oshiete Kureta"" by Houko Kuwashima is those beautiful ending that will make you cherish and adore the value of life and the only earth we are living in.  The ED doesn’t function as mood swinger in the show but rather as prophetic message that we should love and take care of the only planet we have. A song with deep meaning is a song worth giving praise worth of a commentary.Art style (8/10)The art is well made to match the anime mood and story and so it’s good. The art style is particularly use in many depressing mecha series I have watched during the 90’s so won’t say it’s very original. The character doesn’t have appealing or trademark looks but it doesn’t hinder for them to be unique. The mecha are not particularly cool but rather more realistic for the mecha look’s heavy walker tanks pack with multiple weapons. The action scene is not cool but rather focuses on realism. You won’t get cool explosions here nor mecha’s doing insane stunt like other anime do to make the appeal but instead the art style shows the tension of real a battle. The “Blues” was made to become creepy especially their nest and honorably mention the human meat balls they make after killing humans it is extremely creepy. All in all the art style of Blue gender becoming doesn’t bother for the anime but instead make the anime a good old well executed art work classic anime that people should be appreciating.Enjoyment (10/10)Just took me 3 days to marathon this series to be finished meaning I really enjoy the show for it doesn’t bored me. I highly recommend this show for people looking for mature contents surely you will appreciate “Blue Gender” for its great content and concepts.Overall (9/10)Blue Gender is an almost “master piece” in terms of mature apocalyptic events but sadly the anime ended fast and everything ended in a both happy and bad ending at a same time but I appreciate it. Maybe because I cannot give a 10 for master piece for I am demanding more.  Because of the adult demographics the anime have it doesn’t became very popular in more broader audition but mark my words “Blue Gender” is a good anime with logical gore, human emotions, conflicts and world building. I say this anime is good for a try.Extreme Spoiler About the Ending!Additional Spoilers! In case you didn’t understand the ending of the show after you finish “Blue Gender” here’s my logical explanation about it.The problem in the ending of episode 26 why does the People of 2nd Earth killed each other and become blood thirsty apes and killed Seno the good leader. Actually the explanation is simple Miyagi, Seno ordered second earth to stop pursuing to live in the planet earth and continue living in the space station and because of the destruction of the Health Station the people won’t be receiving any medical support so what do you think will happen to that then? The people 2nd earth wanted live in the blue planet and because the objective war in reclaiming earth was there the people have motivation to live without going insane. Without the objective to fight and to live and no medical assistance are given naturally the people in 2nd earth will go mad! There is no entertainment in 2nd earth for the people to pass the time all they have is freedom of sexual intercourse but obviously they will grow tired of that eventually within a year. Nothing to do means suicide. Seno Miyagi didn’t foreseen this which finally fallen him to be killed by his own people. (Well that’s a well-made script writing \uf04a) take refuge in huge space stations which they called “Second Earth”.

Without the objective to fight and to live and no medical assistance are given naturally the people in 2nd earth will go mad! There is no entertainment in 2nd earth for the people to pass the time all they have is freedom of sexual intercourse but obviously they will grow tired of that eventually within a year. Nothing to do means suicide. Seno Miyagi didn’t foreseen this which finally fallen him to be killed by his own people. (Well that’s a well-made script writing \uf04a)', ""Blue Gender is truly a remarkable anime.   It takes the end of the world anime type that is getting a little over used and takes it in a whole new direction.  It surpasses all the other ones I've seen before.  There are many things that takes Blue Gender beyond all the other world ending anime.  First the story, which adds many twists.  How far would we as humans go to survive, and what we would be willing to do to each other.  The cost of war is up front, and doesn't pull any punches.  The action is...great, a relief from the endless giant mecha these type of anime.  The anime is great, a different style from most anime, that works great.  The two main characters: Yuji Kaido and Marlene Angel bring life and hope to this grim anime.  As the  anime progresses you how the story takes it's tole and them and how it changes them and you feel it as well.  Overall Blue Gender is a classic anime, that change your view of the world.  A must see for everyone who is 16 or older. great, a relief from the endless giant mecha these type of anime.  The anime is great, a different style from most anime, that works great.

A must see for everyone who is 16 or older."", 'With all the praise given to classic masterpieces and all the hate thrown around at whatever becomes more popular than it should, it\'s always fun to go back and take a look at an anime that literally no one gives a flying duck shit about.Y\'know? A series that\'s not atrocious enough to be called bad, but hardly has enough going for it to even consider it as being ""good"". Just straight up, no holds barred mediocre. After all, the golden rule of entertainment media is ""Be great, or be really bad. Otherwise, no one cares.""There will be spoilers, though you shouldn\'t care....Really.Blue Gender is one of those late 90\'s anime that you see floating around here and there and read a quick plot summary, maybe a brief wiki search, but then you realize that the only reason it caught your attention for even a fraction of a second is because the title is so jaw droppingly stupid that you just couldn\'t help yourself so you move on with your life. Unless your me, and like me not having a clue what you were doing when first getting into anime, so you watched whatever you thought looked cool at the time.As my amateur self soon discovered, Blue Gender is a post apocalyptic series set many years into the future when our protagonist, Yuji, wakes up from cryo-sleep to find that the world has been taken over by carnivorous Beatles called The Blue, which is probably the least intimidating name for a race of insects resulting in the extinction of humanity that I\'ve ever heard. Yuji comes across a group of resistance fighters piloting mechs (because why the hell not), who he joins with. And in what is literally the only interesting twist this anime has to offer, rather than Yuji simply grabbing himself a mech and going on many grand and wonderous adventures with his new resistance friends in an attempt to rid the world of the evil space Beatles, episode two has pretty much everyone die horribly except for Yuji and a couple other people.This leads to some fairly decent next few episodes, as it focuses on the small group of survivors as they attempt to reach a space base to escape to a space station poetically called Second Earth.So about these characters. Of the four that weren\'t killed off in the second episode, two of them were likable. Those two die within the next couple episodes. So, we\'re stuck with GenericMcLameFace Yuji, and AngstyMcMumbles Marlene.Yuji is an ungrateful pair of ovaries. Scared of everything, and always complaining. Not that this isn\'t realistic for someone forced into his situation, but we the audience are forced to follow this idiot through the entire series. The only other important character, Marlene, is the exact polar opposite. She has no personality, and is stone cold in everything she says and does. Not the most entertaining lead duo, but thankfully these first twelve episodes are surprisingly well made, with some engaging plot lines and decent character development.It\'s nothing special or original, but survival stories have always intrigued me. Blue Gender has a thing for the unexpected, introducing characters, getting you attached to them and then unapologetically killing them off in terribly violent ways. It\'s refreshing to have a story where you really don\'t know what\'s going to happen, where you can\'t call exactly where it\'s going to go from the beginning. However, it takes a bit too much pride in its unpredictability, and eventually you start to expect the obligatory tragedy. The enjoyment factor also takes a huge blow due to sub par animation and bland action scenes. The story elements still work though, and carries a good deal of emotional weight.In those first twelve episodes.Yes, if Blue Gender had ended with our characters reaching that space station and living happily ever after, I would be praising this show as a solid post apocalyptic action series. But no, of course not. Of course it has to continue. And after they get on that space station and the awfully forced transition to the second story arc is made, the writers ran out of ideas really, really fast.The second half of the series is boring, generic, illogical, nonsensical, and an absolute mess in every aspect. The plot gets extremely confusing, and the characters become laughable. Remember the decent development from the first half? Well, by a few episodes into the second half, Yuji and Marlene\'s personalities have completely swapped. A brand new cast of supporting characters are introduced, and every one of them is annoying. The pace slows down to a painful crawl as it focuses on the humans fighting back against the Blue, which is a storyline the show avoided in the beginning and is the exact reason it didn\'t suck in the first place, and now that\'s what it\'s all about. It becomes a huge collection of sci-fi cliches, as well as some tropes thrown in from other genres for good measure. At one point, a horribly, horribly forced love triangle is brought into the mix for no reason whatsoever.Pretty much everything that could go wrong with the script went wrong, and then worse. The inconsistent  characters start throwing out betrayals left and right, a hilariously obvious evil council of shady political figures comes into play, a predictable and unsatisfying twist is revealed, and the ending is so unforgivably retarded that you won\'t even care to ask yourself what the actual fuk just happened.On top of all this, there\'s a painfully obvious feeling that the show is trying it\'s very best to rip off many greater sci-fi works, in particular Evangelion. It\'s hard to explain in text, but it really shows when watching. While NGE knew what it was doing, Blue Gender was a sad attempt at trying to replicate the intricate psychological intrigue by throwing a whole lot of completely ridiculous and out of place moral messages at you all at once that seem to come out of nowhere. It\'s not even close to subtle, and really, really stupid.I didn\'t like Blue Gender. I can\'t recommend Blue Gender. It\'s too busy putting it\'s head up it\'s own rectal corridor to expand on the potential it gives its first half, but then again, those first few episodes are legitimately engaging at times. It\'s the very definition of mediocre: Not good, not bad, and not worth it.

It\'s the very definition of mediocre: Not good, not bad, and not worth it.', 'In my humble opinion Blue Gender is one of the most underrated anime, maybe because its style is a far cry from the usual anime tropes. When I bought the DVD many years ago, I knew very little about anime and chose this series on a whim. I consider myself lucky. Now that I\'ve re-watched it, as an anime veteran, I can fully appreciate it for what it is and what it tries to do.- What is it ?-----------------Blue Gender is a story about a young man of today waking up in a brutal futuristic world. Yugi Kaido was one of many people in the...early 21st century, who were diagnosed with a strange genetic disease. With the absence of a cure, they had no other option but to enter cryogenic sleep, until one was found. Suddenly, Yugi is wakened into a future where the Earth is overrun by an insectoid species called ""The Blue"". Their vast numbers and ability to adapt to all situations have made them an almost unbeatable foe. The remnants of mankind have been forced to leave Earth and make a huge space station their new home. Those not smart or rich enough to be given a ticket to space, were left behind and are considered dead. Humans only come down to earth to fight the Blue and gather resources. In one of those expeditions Yugi is accidentally awakened and he is forced to face the fact that the world he knew is gone and a horrible nightmare has taken its place.Blue Gender is a post apocalyptic / Sci-fi series that shares similarities with movies like Aliens or Starship Troopers. I\'d have a hard time finding many anime counterparts. It shows us a dark future where humans live in perpetual danger and are constantly hunted down by a relentless foe. The soldiers that come to Earth to fight, have to shut down their emotions in order to cope with the atrocities they have to face. Yugi on the other hand has to face the terror of a new, haunting, reality and has to try to cooperate with people that have forgotten how to be humans. He has to deal with the fact that they don`t even consider him a person but rather they think of him as a ""sample"". This series isn\'t just a dystopian action thriller though, it\'s also a critique on humanity and its constant urge to expand and devour. It`s a study of human psyche and how it reacts in conditions of isolation and desolation.On the other hand, we have Marlene. She experienced the infestation of the blue at a very young age and can only remember this devastating world. She was assigned a role in the combat devision and she was the one that found Yugi. In order to survive she has shielded herself from everything and can only think of her mission objectives. She considers Yugi as just another objective and a hindrance that he`s awakened, since now she has to babysit a pathetic remnant of the past. In time she will change her opinion of him and she will change herself, not only because Yugi will help in the fight for survival, but also because he will break down her barriers with his hopeful demeanor. The interesting thing here is that these two characters will even exchange roles. It\'s one of the few cases in anime where ""Character progression"" isn\'t the usual unrealistic and forced fare, but it actually feels right. So, eventually Blue Gender is also a story about love and newfound hope.- How does it look ?--------------------------You wont find colorful scenes and shiny mecha here. The world is painted in bleak colors, with crumbled cities full of Blue nests and ugly monsters roaming the streets. The mecha actually look like human exoskeletons designed for combat and not like plastic toys. I really liked the character designs, especially the two protagonists who look completely distinguishable from other anime characters without being caricatures. The animation quality is good, not top notch, but for a 1999 anime you\'ve got nothing to complain about. It could use a bit more fluidity in the combat scenes, but I don\'t recall any still frames, or any early 3D and that\'s a plus. In the audio department things look even better. Both the opening (a powerful hard rock song) and the ending (an atmospheric ballad) are beautiful tracks and it`s one of the few times where their English versions are equally good. As for the Voice Overs, both the Japanese and English are professional, without being anything exceptional though. The actual soundtrack consists mainly of ambient tracks that never take a prominent position, but they usually add to the atmosphere. I especially remember a haunting tune that played when we were first shown the ruined cities, it was very fitting.- What it tries to do ?----------------------------Thankfully, this anime isn\'t based on an on-going manga, so it has a start, a real ending and a normal length.This is an anime that tries to cater the adult crowd, or should I say the anime crowd that would like some less childish entertainment. The protagonists are adults (or almost adults) and they have to face life threatening situations in realistic --in the context-- environments. Gone are the schoolboy protagonists, gone is the teenage angst, gone are the awkward Japanese attempts at slapstick comedy. Ok, we aren\'t completely ridden of cliché. The main character does have a special ability, but at least he isn\'t the only one, it\'s not really a blessing and he doesn\'t save the world or something like that. Yes, the anime tries to be dark and gritty and it\'s mostly successful. There is a lot of gore but it never feels too excessive. Also, there are some showings of sexual acts, and some of them do feel a bit unnecessary, but in a world where people drool over bouncing ecchi boobs and pantie flashing, I\'ll take a god to honest sex scene every day, thank you very much.Let\'s set aside the grittiness though, because it\'s just a wrapping. The anime is ultimately trying to convey a message. It\'s trying to criticize many aspects of human behavior. And it does this successfully, without being didactic, without being naive or forceful. It\'s a simple message, it\'s not an overly optimistic message, but it\'s a good one and it\'s refreshing to see it in such a story. Blue Gender isn\'t a masterpiece. It could have had a more fleshed-out story, it could have had more interesting side-characters (and one less annoying side character), it could also use a couple more episodes to make the pace better in the second season. It\'s not as deep as Ghost in the Shell and it\'s not as stylish as Cowboy Bebop, but it\'s a very good series, one that deserves better recognition. It\'s a post-apoc/sci-fi action thriller, it`s a love story and it`s a critique on humanity\'s faults all wrapped up in a neat little 26 episode package. If you like post apocalyptic, or sci-fi settings and won`t shy away from a bit of gore, give it a try, you may find more than what you were expecting. early 21st century, who were diagnosed with a strange genetic disease.

Well it  left me wondering what was going to happen next. But is sad is not like the other anime I seen this anime is old but is like a anime new anime is so cool wow I yes don&rsquo;t know how to tell u guys how good it is. A race of alien bugs called the Blue have taken over the planet, and a few select humans have retreated to the space station Second Earth. Yuji is taken back to Second Earth, where he learns that he and the...other sleepers will be instrumental in defeating the Blue. And his relationship with one member of the recovery squad only serves to complicate things.Well I&rsquo;m telling u guy if u wish to see something good this anime is  a hot anime to see god to good, Well if u wish not to cry don&rsquo;t see it because u will cry big time, yeh sexy guy and sexy girl ^^ yeh yeh other sleepers will be instrumental in defeating the Blue. And his relationship with one member of the recovery squad only serves to complicate things.Well I&rsquo;m telling u guy if u wish to see something good this anime is  a hot anime to see god to good, Well if u wish not to cry don&rsquo;t see it because u will cry big time, yeh sexy guy and sexy girl ^^ yeh yeh', 'Note: I have a soft spot for this series. It\'s one of my gateway anime and one of the first ones I\'ve watched outside of television. I still like it, but I\'ll try to be as unbiased as I possibly can.This is a spoiler free review.*Story*The story is basically a survival-monster-apocalypse kinda story with giant bug like aliens called ""Blue"". It centers around Yuji, a guy who is cryogenically frozen for 20 years and eventually wakes up in a living nightmare.The story itself does have a rather large scale of both a space colony and the entirety earth. It is quite intriguing and they...do explore this setting thoroughly enough. They explore the living conditions and resentment of the people abandoned on earth and also the technologically advanced people in space and how each of their living conditions influences the basic nature of the population. There\'s also political disputes eventually, nothing too complicated, but it\'s interesting enough.The pacing is on the slow side, but it\'s not that noticeable since it\'s pretty consistent and it never sidetracks.I think it\'s safe to say that this anime\'s central theme is what sets us apart from beasts it is conveyed through the main 2 main characters\' relationship and Marline\'s attempt to become more human and Yuji\'s descent into becoming a beast. And the general juxtaposition between the ""ground crawling"" humans on earth and the people who lost their humanity on ""second earth"".On the other hand, I\'m not too fond of the whole \'humanity is a disease\' message that it seems to fall into, and it\'s not even particularly  subtle either. But I normally don\'t rate based on an anime\'s message, even if I don\'t like it.A more practical problem with the story however, is that at some point it disregards some cool ideas that it introduced earlier regarding the evolution of the aliens and in the second half it establishes new plot points and twists that are a bit odd (and maybe even jarring). I can\'t spoil it, but let\'s just say that it introduces super robot elements in to a story that was initially established as a more grounded ""real robot"" anime.It does end in a conclusive way, but the ending also comes off as odd and it\'s related to the above issue. It does sort of make sense more or less, but something about it just seems off.Another problem is that the story is very one-note.. It\'s pretty much a non-stop misery train in which we move from one tragedy to the next (with some glimmers of hope here and there). So this might be one of the reasons this series is not well received by many. And I think that\'s a legitimate reason since many people watch anime for escapism. Needless to say, this setting is not the ideal place to escape to...Overall, the story presents its themes very, is well paced and has just enough variety to it. Though I begrudgingly admit that it\'s not perfect and it\'s not for everybody.*Characters*The main characters consist of a ""cooldere"", Marline and a male lead, Yuji, who\'s kind of an average joe. The series\' main focus is on their relationship. They both have great chemistry. Their back-stories are a bit lacking and vague, but both of them develop a great deal throughout the series and believe me when I say this is the heart and soul of it.They give a lot of attention to how these characters react to the situations they\'re in and I think that\'s done quite well and in a relatively realistic manner.Even the sexual relationships  this series contains is handled very maturely and nothing seems too fanservicy.The problem is that these two characters get almost all of the focus and the rest of the cast feel kinda like cannon fodder or people who just happened to get in the way. Some characters are killed off pretty quickly and we don\'t get much of a chance to know them.In the second half of the series more characters emerge and they\'re certianly more interesting than the older ones that we killed off. Not much depth, but they serve their purpose.The characters in general aren\'t fun to watch either since they seem depressed and have nihilistic tendencies. So don’t expect them to be too relatable or likable.They generally create an unpleasant atmosphere that\'s certainly not for everybody.Overall, the characterization is pretty damn good, especially for the main two characters. Everything is handled very seriously and maturely, but don\'t expect this to be the most memorable or colorful cast out there, because it\'s not. The main girl, Marline is a well rounded and fantastic character though.*Art*The character designs are nothing that special, but are very much to my liking since they\'re very mature looking, none of them look like blobs and all of the characters are adults.The surroundings are very well done and have a ton of destroyed buildings and alien nests that still look very creepy and quite detailed..Mecha designs are nothing too memorable, but are still quite interesting since they look more like tanks with limbs than anything else. The animation is fairly decent, but the mechs movements are pretty limited which also means that there isn\'t all that much choreography in the battles. The battles are still very intense though, since you do feel like the characters really are in danger and there\'s a minimal amount of plot armor. Besides, it\'s very gory and creepy. The alien designs are creepy as hell and have a decent enough amount of variety to them.Overall the visuals hold up quite well. It\'s nothing outstanding for its time and not much stands out about it artistically, but it\'s still quite good.*Sound*You have a very nice rock song as the opening and a more depressing song as the ending (a very memorable song, by the way). The soundtrack in general is great and mostly very creepy, but I did notice that it sounds like it\'s almost muted sometimes so maybe it could\'ve been used a little better.The (Japanese) voice acting sounds mature enough to fit the atmosphere the series is going for and each voice fits quite well with the characters. The sound effects are also used effectively and in a creepy way.The sound is pretty amazing overall.*Overall* 7/10It\'s both enjoyable and unpleasant at the same time.Blue Gender does have its drawbacks and it\'s certainly not for everybody.But all in all, it\'s a solid cult classic that\'s definitely worth checking out. do explore this setting thoroughly enough.

I can\'t spoil it, but let\'s just say that it introduces super robot elements in to a story that was initially established as a more grounded ""real robot"" anime.It does end in a conclusive way, but the ending also comes off as odd and it\'s related to the above issue. It does sort of make sense more or less, but something about it just seems off.Another problem is that the story is very one-note.. It\'s pretty much a non-stop misery train in which we move from one tragedy to the next (with some glimmers of hope here and there). So this might be one of the reasons this series is not well received by many. And I think that\'s a legitimate reason since many people watch anime for escapism. Needless to say, this setting is not the ideal place to escape to...Overall, the story presents its themes very, is well paced and has just enough variety to it. Though I begrudgingly admit that it\'s not perfect and it\'s not for everybody.*Characters*The main characters consist of a ""cooldere"", Marline and a male lead, Yuji, who\'s kind of an average joe. The series\' main focus is on their relationship. They both have great chemistry. Their back-stories are a bit lacking and vague, but both of them develop a great deal throughout the series and believe me when I say this is the heart and soul of it.They give a lot of attention to how these characters react to the situations they\'re in and I think that\'s done quite well and in a relatively realistic manner.Even the sexual relationships  this series contains is handled very maturely and nothing seems too fanservicy.The problem is that these two characters get almost all of the focus and the rest of the cast feel kinda like cannon fodder or people who just happened to get in the way. Some characters are killed off pretty quickly and we don\'t get much of a chance to know them.In the second half of the series more characters emerge and they\'re certianly more interesting than the older ones that we killed off. Not much depth, but they serve their purpose.The characters in general aren\'t fun to watch either since they seem depressed and have nihilistic tendencies. So don’t expect them to be too relatable or likable.They generally create an unpleasant atmosphere that\'s certainly not for everybody.Overall, the characterization is pretty damn good, especially for the main two characters. Everything is handled very seriously and maturely, but don\'t expect this to be the most memorable or colorful cast out there, because it\'s not. The main girl, Marline is a well rounded and fantastic character though.*Art*The character designs are nothing that special, but are very much to my liking since they\'re very mature looking, none of them look like blobs and all of the characters are adults.The surroundings are very well done and have a ton of destroyed buildings and alien nests that still look very creepy and quite detailed..Mecha designs are nothing too memorable, but are still quite interesting since they look more like tanks with limbs than anything else. The animation is fairly decent, but the mechs movements are pretty limited which also means that there isn\'t all that much choreography in the battles. The battles are still very intense though, since you do feel like the characters really are in danger and there\'s a minimal amount of plot armor. Besides, it\'s very gory and creepy. The alien designs are creepy as hell and have a decent enough amount of variety to them.Overall the visuals hold up quite well. It\'s nothing outstanding for its time and not much stands out about it artistically, but it\'s still quite good.*Sound*You have a very nice rock song as the opening and a more depressing song as the ending (a very memorable song, by the way). The soundtrack in general is great and mostly very creepy, but I did notice that it sounds like it\'s almost muted sometimes so maybe it could\'ve been used a little better.The (Japanese) voice acting sounds mature enough to fit the atmosphere the series is going for and each voice fits quite well with the characters. The sound effects are also used effectively and in a creepy way.The sound is pretty amazing overall.*Overall* 7/10It\'s both enjoyable and unpleasant at the same time.Blue Gender does have its drawbacks and it\'s certainly not for everybody.But all in all, it\'s a solid cult classic that\'s definitely worth checking out.', 'Ah, post apocalyptic animes are so much fun. I love how they always manage to over-dramatize the end of the world, a story arc that you would think has enough drama on its own. Sarcasm aside, Blue Gender is a surprisingly deep sci-fi drama with a lot going for it. Before I get started on the actual review though, let me just point out that the content rating on this anime seems to always be wrong wherever I go, including on the box set. I bought the collectors box set at Best Buy and after checking the back for the content rating I see that...it has it listed as �TV-PG.� TV-PG?! They must be nuts! Blue Gender has more people getting killed in single scenes than most of the goriest animes even have. Not just soldiers, but women and children as well. I don�t know, but I wouldn�t want little Timmy or Susie watching this in place of Pokemon expecting to be whisked away to some dreamy sci-fi fantasy world. No, Blue Gender is serious business, and certainly not TV-PG. Other sources have it listed as PG-13, but I can�t see how that�s right either. Besides the gore there is quite a bit of nudity, sex, and various other adult situations that I don�t think would make its way into any PG-13 movie I�ve ever seen. There are even a few scenes with orgies in them (yes, orgies). Hell, even the ED has full nudity in it. I�m calling this one �R� and I�m sticking to it, feel free to give it your own rating though if you feel mine is too drastic.Blue Gender starts out simple enough. The Earth has been overrun by creatures known simply as Blue, and the remaining human race is struggling to take their planet back from them. For the first couple of episodes it�s the atmosphere and how the characters interact within it that really makes the show stand out. Everything feels as dead as it looks, and the characters all have this very emotionless way of going about themselves that is actually quite frightening. The main heroine (Marlene) especially. She�s this tough ass soldier chick who doesn�t care about anything except for the mission. She doesn�t care if her comrades die, and civilians are nothing but obstacles to her. In a way she�s more machine than she is human, mentally programmed to carry out her duties and nothing more. Yuji is one of the few cast members in the entire series that shows emotions and personality outside of the soldier, but it pretty much falls to deaf ears for more than half the series. Since I enjoy making comparisons, I�d consider it safe to say that fans of films like Aliens and The Thing would enjoy Blue Gender quite a bit. While none of those movies were post apocalyptic in any way, they both have a very similar feel to Blue Gender. A very dry, dead, scary and rather depressing feel, and where characters are very two dimensional only due to the fact that they don�t know how to act otherwise, constantly in fear or ready for combat. This is the world of Blue Gender in a nutshell.Like I said earlier, Blue Gender is a pretty depressing anime. It doesn�t pull any punches, and doesn�t leave too many characters alive for very long. But besides that, it�s also rather sad to see mankind forced into outer space to live in some space station they call �Second Earth� all because of some giant bug infestation. I find it pretty far fetched that mankind, as stubborn as it is, didn�t just nuke the hell out of Earth before letting the Blue take it over and multiply even more in a sort of �if we can�t have it then nobody can� type of deal. Or at least dropped a few tactical strikes on the locations with the most Blue and then sent in an assault team to take out the rest. But, what do I know? It�s not like I�ve ever been in a post apocalyptic reality before. Without nitpicking too much though I will compliment the series on its cultural diversity. Besides Yuji and a few others, the characters all seem to range in nationality. This is a problem I always had with most post apocalyptic stories regardless of it being an anime or some other form of media. The main characters would all come from one country, and the major threats would all seem to center around one location, which doesn�t make sense with it being a global event. If Blue Gender does one thing perfectly, it�s making sure the Blue are all over the world and not just in Japan or some other part of Asia, and also making sure that many characters of the story come from different places. It�s not often I watch an anime where names like Yuji and Rick can coexist.Although I did imply something about the characters being very two dimensional, that doesn�t mean there isn�t any character development throughout the series, but it is rather limited. The only characters that really have any development are Marlene and Yuji, our two main heroes of the show. It�s interesting to watch these two characters slowly evolve throughout the series, especially early on when they are so different from one another. Yuji wants to save the world and everyone in it, while Marlene just wants to eradicate the Blue and doesn�t give a damn about collateral damage. These two characters grow rather fond of each other, and by mid/late-season actually begin falling for one another. What is strange (and actually quite annoying in my opinion) is how the writers decided to use these two characters during the later half of the show. Without spoiling too much, lets just say Yuji and Marlene have a bit of a personality shift. Luckily things don�t stay like this for the rest of the series, but it was a tad bit infuriating to see more than a dozen episodes worth of character development get flushed down the toilet in a single episode.The audio and visuals of Blue Gender are not what you would call high quality, but they get the job done I suppose. On the audio side, it�s all actually very good at setting the mood, but there just isn�t a whole lot of it. One tune in particular seems to play throughout the entire series. I�m also 99% sure I heard the song �Angel� by Massive Attack in one of the later episodes (during the orgy scene with Alicia and Yuji) but it was only the opening of the song and nothing else so I can�t be completely certain. But if so, then that was probably just something FUNimation threw in since I know they like to use �real� bands in their productions� The animation in Blue Gender is often times pretty cheap. The blood effects for example should have been a lot better when you consider the year it came out. Another thing I found funny was how the Armor Shrike�s (the mechs piloted throughout the series) had wheels attached to the bottom of their feet as a way of moving around. This probably made things easier to animate since they rarely had to animate the movement of the Armor Shrike�s legs and could easily just slide them across the screen (which also looked pretty cheap, since I doubt giant mechs would glide almost silently across rocky badlands). To be blunt, some of the movements of the Armor Shrike�s looked like they were done using a Macromedia Flash motion tween. With that said, I really don�t think this is an anime mech fans are going to want to pick up if it�s for the sole purpose of seeing some hot mech on bug action. Blue Gender has its flaws and certainly isn�t something I can guarantee you�ll enjoy, but if you�re ever in the mood for yet another post apocalyptic anime then I don�t see how it could hurt to check out Blue Gender.My Score: 7.5Version Watched: English Dub it has it listed as �TV-PG.� TV-PG?!

The series itself is a great example of how loyal to the ""adult audience only"" idea anime could remain back in the days.*light spoilers follow*From its settings, Blue Gender is highly similar to the cult feature film, Starship troopers, that was released only 2 years before the anime. In this case, our main character wakes up from an artificial sleep -- that is heavily plot-related -- to discover how the world he once knew has been overtaken by a species of over-sized alien bugs -- called Blue --...who are being fought against by a military organization whose current active mission includes *saving* sleepers like him and bring them back to headquarters.Around half of the entire anime centers around this first mission where the main character travels with the military group and discovers what type of a place the world has become and how much people have changed due to the effects of the *apocalypse*. This side of the anime is easily the most impressive part of the work. It managed to show how several civilian groups have learnt/have not learnt to cope with the situation and how normal things such as death have become. During the first 3 episodes of the series, 80% of the introduced cast is killed with brutal and gorey ways, be it Blue ripping off their arms, smashing against vehicles so hard that people snap their neck and paralyze or their heads getting crushed by the overwhelming power of these creatures. What is really interesting about this work is how the soldiers deal with the death of their comrades and how brutally they have lost the will to give a fuck about anything: the soldiers just bang each others and have orgies during breaks just to lighten the mood a bit.  It\'s a rough world, yet the content itself is not introduced in an edgy manner, but rather to show that these examples I mentioned are as ""normal"" and ""common"" in the world of this series as they are unlikely to happen in the real world.The story of Blue Gender is hardly limited or even focusing heavily on the things I mentioned, rather these elements just are there as part of the universe: things that add to the overall world and its building as well as to the characters. Blue Gender is really does have its own world and the world has bit of everything going on at the same. Character-wise, interactions, effect and both; the differences and similarities of different character groups are taken into consideration and they play a huge part in the series on a general level, in the politics as well as between personal relationships of the characters. Since the world consists of several different civil groups, military organizations, politicians, the sleepers and of course Blue, a lot is going on at the same. It is not easy to even make a proper lit of all the different genres the series manages to gasp during its run, but other than the mentioned things, romance and character development are highly valued in the series. There is also horror, drama, and more psychological side to it all. Mecha -side also exist among the work in the military side of the story and the very ending of the series could be considered to fall under the dementia or ""chaos"" genre with its level of existential madness.To give some sort of picture of the characters: the two *real* main leads are pretty much the nro 1 reason why the work with its world stands out. Their interactions and character development is fascinating to say the least as one of them is a female soldier who is downright badass, almost emotionally dead person who has heavily molded herself to be able to deal with the horrors she faces in her job, which she has managed to make her sole reason to exists: all she sees in the beginning of the series is the military she works for and the only thing that matters is the to succeed in her current mission. The main male lead is almost the far opposite of her: person who lived in the *ideal* world timeline as a happy commoner. Guy who shares the social norms of *our* world, almost chaotically good person who is also a coward and extremely unfit to live in the world of the Blue. Yet these characters change, adapt, are heavily influenced by each others and eventually form the main romance plot line in the work.To quickly sum up the production: the art and animation are outdated, but also have that style that appears incredibly welcoming to all of those who dig the *mature* style that was often used in the end of 20th century/in the beginning of the 21st. The soundtrack is simply fantastic, especially the opening and ending songs are nothing less than classics. The English version of the op is simply an incredible song. Personally I watched the series Eng dubbed because I heard it is one of the most underlooked English dubs and have to say it felt more natural than the Japanese version.Enjoyment-wise, I highly enjoyed the genuine and accurate take on how humans can and do change. Series that so heavily focus on creating believable psychological side are nothing less than scarce. The character behavior and development made so much sense it was a pleasure to witness it happen. Some bigger problems do exist in the story and especially during the 2nd half of the series, but I could overlook most of them because of the good sides that managed to impress me. who are being fought against by a military organization whose current active mission includes *saving* sleepers like him and bring them back to headquarters.Around half of the entire anime centers around this first mission where the main character travels with the military group and discovers what type of a place the world has become and how much people have changed due to the effects of the *apocalypse*.

I fell in love with Blue Gender the first time I saw the first episode. Post-Apocalyptic stories, a good bit of romance, one man and his love against the world...all sounds a bit cliche but Blue Gender has a bit of something that puts it past its overdone plot elements. I can't put my finger on what it is exactly, whether it be the enthralling characters, rocking soundtrack, or the sheer boldness of the series itself.If pressed I'd say the two main characters, Yuji Kaido and Marlene Angel are what really...make the anime. It's heavily character oriented and I haven't seen too many anime that develop characters as well as Blue Gender. They are what keep the viewer heavily interested in the down points of the plot, which are few but IMO are still there.Though not without it's faults, Blue Gender is still quite amazing, and if you can get past the bits and pieces of sex and nudity, they I would highly recommend it to anyone slightly interested in a sci-fi epic. make the anime.

It\'s all down-hill from there.  Despite having a ton of tags & genres, it doesn\'t do any of them well.  Quite the opposite, it manages to do every single thing it attempts worse than if it had just neglected to tackle it in the first place.  I honestly don\'t even know where to start with this, but I guess since he was the first thing you\'re introduced to, let\'s start with the main character, Yuji.  Awoken to a hectic battle, with the power to simply run away in horror, you can immediately empathize...with him.  He\'s alone, in the dark, being chased by ominous soldiers and hellish bug monsters, with no clue when or where he is or what\'s going on.  You can understand the angst, the despair, the frustration, the confusion, you can see why he\'s frightened and jumpy, or to put it simply, this isn\'t Yuji at his best.  However... as the situation relaxes and he gets his bearings, you unfortunately get to see what Yuji is like even when he\'s feeling better, and it\'s just as bad.  He\'s sanctimonious, selfish, rash, and his only ""good"" traits are that he has a basic moral code, and that\'s it.  Unfortunately his more consistent traits, his self-centered impulsiveness means he\'s always going about doing the right thing in the worst way possible and only the power of hack writing can save his sorry ass.  If it weren\'t for the foot-thick steel plot armor (sometimes literally) around him, he would do more to damage his cause than any mindless bug alien mook or cartoonish evil government asshole.  At his best moments, he\'s tolerable.  He\'s never likable, you will never say ""man I can\'t wait to see Yuji"" or ""How will Yuji deal with this situation?""  An insufferable lead character, and that brings us to his better half (only marginally), Marlene.  Marlene is the cool, stony soldier, tough as nails and committed to the mission: except when the author gets horny. Yeah, Marlene is either the stand-in for Yuji, the object of cringeworthy lust or romance-pandering, and basically eye and heart candy, never rising above her stereotype.That brings me to one of the biggest issues with this show: this ""romance"" is basically the driving force of everything in the show after the first couple episodes, and it SUCKS.  Yuji sucks, Marlene sucks, the two pining for each other sucks, and the amount of ways the plot has to warp and bend to get them apart then bring them back together then take them away from each other then bring them back together over and over again is excruciating.  I would suggest you grab a spoon if you wanna watch this with which you may gag yourself.  The major conflict of the first quarter of the show is Yuji being torn between Marlene or some nomad fling he meets on the way to the next story beat. It is so ridiculously contrived, and the writing is so sloppy that only that aforementioned double-duty plot armor can keep them from meeting the same fate as the rest of the meat puppets the show throws into harm\'s way to give the illusion that life in Blue Gender is fleeting.  Going by the quick departures for the rest of the cast, with particularly gruesome and unceremonious deaths early on to this end, you would think that life is extremely fragile and death could come at any moment.  Yet after the first episode, you can\'t ever fathom that Yuji or Marlene could ever die.  They will always be the last ones standing in the face of wave after wave of endless (and purposeless) bug attacks.  The grimdark tone the series wants is entirely undermined by how hasty the writer is to throw Yuji and Marlene into peril and how half-assedly it bails them back out.  There\'s no tension for either of these fuckheads but everyone else in the show is so throwaway and doomed from their entrance that there\'s nowhere in this to place your concern.  The major conflict of this show isn\'t pragmatism vs idealism in wartime, it\'s not man vs nature, it\'s not even man vs man, it\'s ""when will Yuji and Marlene get together?""  Gory deaths for the side characters, dismal outcomes for everybody not in the starring roles, frightening stakes for those not graced with plot armor all give the illusion of a serious, mature world and story, but this is a juvenile romance novel for tweens at heart.  And to make it clear, I\'m not mad that it\'s a romance.  I\'m mad that the romance is ass and all other aspects of the show are undermined by it, not that any of them fare much better in terms of quality of the writing.The show is split into basically two halves, the first half being Yuji and Marlene\'s meet-cute on Earth and ensuing romantic escapades, and the second half being Yuji and Marlene being kept apart by a comically incompetent evil government in space and tying up (poorly) all of the underdeveloped story threads that aren\'t the romance.  What\'s going on with the blues?  What does the goofy ahh government want Yuji\'s ass for?  Well, you\'ll get your hand-wave answers but you\'d probably be more satisfied if you got your answers from chatgpt.  The story is loose and only there to facilitate the cheesy action-adventure-romance, the action is exceedingly dull, similarly perfunctory.  Waves of mooks, stormtrooper accuracy and cartoonish bad-guys, the bugs are flip-flopping between unstoppable terminator-ass forces of nature and squishy mindless walking corpses, the action is under-animated and veiled in darkness and often occuring entirely offscreen or on radar screens and there\'s a lot of standing around gesturing while nothing is happening.  Even when it\'s just combat, no bawdy kissy kissy garbage involved, it\'s rather dull.  Throw in the unwelcome, misplaced, and overemphasized horniness/loneliness and it\'s just a puke-inducing drag.  There\'s no moral conflicts to chew on, there are no characters or plights to get behind, the only thing keeping you watching will be to find out if it gets on the rails and ever delivers on what the first episode made it seem like it would be, but rest-assured, it doesn\'t.  Nothing but moaning, groaning blah awaits. with him.  He\'s alone, in the dark, being chased by ominous soldiers and hellish bug monsters, with no clue when or where he is or what\'s going on.  You can understand the angst, the despair, the frustration, the confusion, you can see why he\'s frightened and jumpy, or to put it simply, this isn\'t Yuji at his best.  However... as the situation relaxes and he gets his bearings, you unfortunately get to see what Yuji is like even when he\'s feeling better, and it\'s just as bad.  He\'s sanctimonious, selfish, rash, and his only ""good"" traits are that he has a basic moral code, and that\'s it.  Unfortunately his more consistent traits, his self-centered impulsiveness means he\'s always going about doing the right thing in the worst way possible and only the power of hack writing can save his sorry ass.  If it weren\'t for the foot-thick steel plot armor (sometimes literally) around him, he would do more to damage his cause than any mindless bug alien mook or cartoonish evil government asshole.  At his best moments, he\'s tolerable.  He\'s never likable, you will never say ""man I can\'t wait to see Yuji"" or ""How will Yuji deal with this situation?""  An insufferable lead character, and that brings us to his better half (only marginally), Marlene.  Marlene is the cool, stony soldier, tough as nails and committed to the mission: except when the author gets horny. Yeah, Marlene is either the stand-in for Yuji, the object of cringeworthy lust or romance-pandering, and basically eye and heart candy, never rising above her stereotype.That brings me to one of the biggest issues with this show: this ""romance"" is basically the driving force of everything in the show after the first couple episodes, and it SUCKS.  Yuji sucks, Marlene sucks, the two pining for each other sucks, and the amount of ways the plot has to warp and bend to get them apart then bring them back together then take them away from each other then bring them back together over and over again is excruciating.  I would suggest you grab a spoon if you wanna watch this with which you may gag yourself.  The major conflict of the first quarter of the show is Yuji being torn between Marlene or some nomad fling he meets on the way to the next story beat. It is so ridiculously contrived, and the writing is so sloppy that only that aforementioned double-duty plot armor can keep them from meeting the same fate as the rest of the meat puppets the show throws into harm\'s way to give the illusion that life in Blue Gender is fleeting.  Going by the quick departures for the rest of the cast, with particularly gruesome and unceremonious deaths early on to this end, you would think that life is extremely fragile and death could come at any moment.  Yet after the first episode, you can\'t ever fathom that Yuji or Marlene could ever die.  They will always be the last ones standing in the face of wave after wave of endless (and purposeless) bug attacks.  The grimdark tone the series wants is entirely undermined by how hasty the writer is to throw Yuji and Marlene into peril and how half-assedly it bails them back out.  There\'s no tension for either of these fuckheads but everyone else in the show is so throwaway and doomed from their entrance that there\'s nowhere in this to place your concern.  The major conflict of this show isn\'t pragmatism vs idealism in wartime, it\'s not man vs nature, it\'s not even man vs man, it\'s ""when will Yuji and Marlene get together?""  Gory deaths for the side characters, dismal outcomes for everybody not in the starring roles, frightening stakes for those not graced with plot armor all give the illusion of a serious, mature world and story, but this is a juvenile romance novel for tweens at heart.  And to make it clear, I\'m not mad that it\'s a romance.  I\'m mad that the romance is ass and all other aspects of the show are undermined by it, not that any of them fare much better in terms of quality of the writing.The show is split into basically two halves, the first half being Yuji and Marlene\'s meet-cute on Earth and ensuing romantic escapades, and the second half being Yuji and Marlene being kept apart by a comically incompetent evil government in space and tying up (poorly) all of the underdeveloped story threads that aren\'t the romance.  What\'s going on with the blues?  What does the goofy ahh government want Yuji\'s ass for?

It started out very fast paced and crazy (in a good way) but stalled after the first half. It’s not unwatchable-stalled but you’ll feel the decline and it won’t pick back up. The transition between story arcs feels a bit forced too. It has some dark parts which I thought were well done.Art: The animation was subpar and a lot of shortcuts were used. There was noticeable choppiness during some parts and low resolution scenery. I think the most annoying part...was the way the robots moved. The mechs had two legs but they ALL scooted around on wheels attached to their feet. I can only guess this was done to make drawing them easier. Oh and I HATED Yuji’s haircut. The guy looks like Elijah Wood with a mullet. I just couldn't get over it...Characters: Very good first half, complete character shift second half.  I will say this about the characters, don’t get too attached. This anime gets you to love the side characters then kills them off. I have a lot of problems w/ Blue Gender but I actually respect this anime for not accumulating one huge merry band of un-killable comrades as the story progresses. This is war and survival, and they keep reminding you.Music/sound: average. They use the save 5 or so tracks and it gets repetitive. There’s one very haunting track called “cure” which they play for the sentimental parts. I actually liked it. Compared to some of the horror stories out there the voice acting is very good in the English Dub.Misc catagories:Predictability: the first half was predictable in a good way (i.e. the anime gives you exactly what you want) while the 2nd half is unpredictable in a bad way (characters make very stupid decisions and oversights that really annoy the viewer).Consistency: Good guy bullets seem to hit home while everyone else’s bounce off enemies. The penetration power of the bullets depends on how angry a character is. One enemy is 100 times harder to kill than 100 enemies. This is not really a big deal we’ve all seen this before (inverse ninja law).Violence: a LOT of low resolution blood and gore. It’s not a complete carnage fest like Elfen Lied or portrayed to the freakish detail like Shigurui but it gets your blood pumping…so to speak. Not for little kids.Love Story: You kind of know what’s going to happen. The series builds up a lot of potential but then squanders it with clumsy character shifts that bring you back to square one. It’s not awful (like in Blassreiter for example) and it does have its tender moments but the flow/pace is very average.Sex/Nudity: A few low resolution topless shots w/ a fair amount of “sexual situations”. It wasn’t gratuitous or particularly graphic. Some of the hooking up made me laugh because it was so random and out of the *cough* blue. That being said, I felt there was a lack of sexual tension/chemistry between any of the characters.Overall: It depends what you want.

I felt that Yuji, one of the primary characters was whole heartedly unlikeable from start to finish. He had no redeeming character traits, and his overall actions and performance made the series unenjoyable to watch. Yuji was either a wimp or just arrogant throughout the series.

The anime called Blue Gender never explains what the enigmatic phrase ""blue gender"" even means, and this was in the pre-Tumblr years—not that Japan is into that crap in the first place. I think it\'s just a weird naming convention where they string together random english words and are like BRUE GENDERU and thought it was really cool (I mean, how else do you explain goofy titles like Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer?).Anyway, this is another one of those Heinlein/Starship Troopers-based formulas where you have badasses with mechs battling against massive bugs—this one is a bit psychological, but more in...an average PTSD way rather than particularly deep or compelling; this has a lot of genre listings, and while horror is occasionally fitting, this is too actioney and cheesy to be horror much of the time, and the romance is relegated to pretty small scenes.Given the right-wing themes of the Heinlein novel, you\'d think this would resemble a typical Takahashi story a bit more, but politics play a tiny dumb-dumb element only in the second half, and nationalism is replaced by a united humanity on the militaristic society of ""Second Earth,"" a space colony intent on reclaiming the earth.The unwashed masses of earth who weren\'t esteemed enough to go to Second Earth subsist on bug burgers and are themselves eaten by bugs.

The problem is how poorly animated the whole series is. They manage to make it work much of the time with solid direction and editing in certain episodes, but when that falls through, it\'s absolutely painful to behold. Half the time they just zoom on bugs, pan the camera, cut to reactions of the main characters (OMG DON\'T DIE OKAY X 1,347), and use a lot of cost-saving techniques in general.Having such a dark tone allows them to wash a lot of the surroundings in shadows, and the art is certainly much more passable than the animation, but it looks very dated and low-budget: whether it\'s the character art, the mechs, the bugs, the backdrops, etc. The same 2-3 mechs and bugs are reused regularly.

The dialogue is perfunctory and filled with grunt-speak. The two main characters develop, but not in a very convincing way. You have the one-two punch simple jack arc of Yuji being a whiny bitch who complains about being woken up in hell, then becomes a somewhat more responsible, dependable warrior, but a bit of a loose cannon. There are plenty of predictable moments, like his naive promise of protecting a young girl whose demise was so telegraphed they might as well have stamped DOOMED on her forehead, a homoerotic buddy-buddy segment with monkey wrenches and oil, a drawn-out bore fest where he casts googly eyes at a nomadic girl and considers abandoning his mission—all of it feeling like it was dredged up out of the worst dimestore novels you can find. The latter segment is especially unnecessary, and Yuji, in a rare burst of insight, casts it aside like it\'s nothing—if only the writer could have had the sense to remove it.Marlene is ice-cold, but gets all uwu once she sees Yuji\'s big heart and is saved by him. She discovers loooooove, and that\'s coming from a background where sex is very casual, and Yuji is like ""BUT THEY JUST MET!!!""—one of the more notable aspects of this show is how sexuality is handled.

The ending is kind of like a half-baked dumb version of 2001, but it goes in a very cliched direction, and a few ideas and plot devices don\'t entirely make sense. Insanely rushed ending and the remixing of the OP song is awkward.There\'s something compelling about the bleakness of the early episodes and the dark atmosphere that slowly propelled me into finishing this series. The writing might not be good, but they\'d put in just enough hooks to keep it mildly interesting, but in retrospect, there was never anything interesting at all. I have to say, this show has one of the better OP/ED combos. The OP primes you with its militarism and pulpy violence, and it also has a few slower moments with a somber mood, such as the scene with the cross and when Marlene and Yuji are sitting around and having coffee. It perfectly represents the show, but oversells it a bit. The ED is another one of those TEEHEE LOOK AT THE FEMALE MAIN IN A STATE OF UNDRESS closings, but it\'s nice and relaxed, in its blue tranquility, and a good way to tune out from the show.

Insanely rushed ending and the remixing of the OP song is awkward.There\'s something compelling about the bleakness of the early episodes and the dark atmosphere that slowly propelled me into finishing this series. The writing might not be good, but they\'d put in just enough hooks to keep it mildly interesting, but in retrospect, there was never anything interesting at all. I have to say, this show has one of the better OP/ED combos. The OP primes you with its militarism and pulpy violence, and it also has a few slower moments with a somber mood, such as the scene with the cross and when Marlene and Yuji are sitting around and having coffee. It perfectly represents the show, but oversells it a bit. The ED is another one of those TEEHEE LOOK AT THE FEMALE MAIN IN A STATE OF UNDRESS closings, but it\'s nice and relaxed, in its blue tranquility, and a good way to tune out from the show. It\'s also a pretty good example of packing just enough emotion and animation into a decently paced ED, but still saving on budget.', ""Blue Gender had all the makings of an epic sci-fi adventure story, but falls short in sooo many respects it’s almost painful. It starts with a premise that's been done to death - huge bug-like creatures overrun earth, humans now live in space and are fighting to get their planet back, main characters that suffer from incomplete/nonsensical development, a weak climax, a disappointing finale and an idiotic explanation to wrap everything together.So should you bother with this show?Well, yes, and here's why. It's not completely terrible.Yugi, our main character, has a genetic disorder which results in him being put to sleep for 20 years. Needless...to say, he misses the aforementioned eviction of humanity from Earth and the arrival of its newest, multi-limbed tenants. Marlene, our buxom blonde soldier girl, is part of the elite unit tasked with retrieving Yugi and his fellow ‘sleepers’ from Earth to deliver to a bunch of creepy scientists back in space. An unexpected attack results in Yugi waking up in the middle of a battle and having to very quickly come to terms with the brave new world Earth has become.So here’s the thing, neither Yugi nor Marlene are particularly compelling as main characters, and whether you stick with this series or not pretty much comes down to whether you can tolerate these two for the entire series. That being said, the first half plays heavily on their different outlooks to life on an infested Earth and this by and large, carries the series. Their interactions alone for the first 12 or so episodes are worth the price of admission. We see some decent plot and character development, which while not complex, is consistent and makes the show watchable and even enjoyable. You begin to connect with the characters and invest in the rocky partnership forming between Marlene and Yugi. This makes the sense of foreboding as her mission draws to an end that much more poignant.Then everything changes. We get to see the story primarily from Marlene’s perspective; the problem is that character continuity is done away with to accommodate a new plot line which takes everything that was good about the first half and dumps it out the shoot. Marlene’s behavior towards Yugi will leave you wondering if you missed something – you didn’t. Yugi for his part is also completely unrecognizable. To be fair, it’s obvious the producers were probably trying to do something ‘deep’ with the roles the two main characters play in the 2nd half of the series, and had their transformation been handled more believably, it might have worked. As it stands though, I was left feeling like the show and copped out on real character development for the sake of cheap gimmicks and shock value.The story also begins to inculcate themes of political intrigue, and while adding politics lent an extra touch of realism to the show, the writers also dropped the ball here, and that was a real shame. Blue Gender is fascinating when you consider who the political heroes and villains really were, and who was turned out to be the misguided lunatic, but this is all presented in such a jumbled fashion that the message barely makes it out at all. And this is a real shame because if pulled off correctly, this would have made the show brilliant, despite the liberties taken with the main characters.But politics was not the only problem, the conclusion – that inevitable explanation for WHY everything happened, turned out to be … well … stupid. Without giving anything away I will say that it was so lame I considered it insulting to my intelligence. Thankfully such tomfoolery is reserved for the very last episode.In the end, Blue Gender falls short of expectations, given some of the things it tried to do. But as I said, the show's not all bad. This is still a very mature story, with poignant themes about morality if you know where to look. There is a depth and seriousness to this series which separates it from run of the mill Mecha anime.  In retrospect, Blue Gender might have taken itself too seriously for its own good, and while it does not quite pull off the grand plans it had for itself, there’s enough there to keep you thinking about it for a while to come.Art:This is an old anime, so even though I'd say it's decent you will be appalled if you're comparing it to today's stuff. to say, he misses the aforementioned eviction of humanity from Earth and the arrival of its newest, multi-limbed tenants.

Unlike AoT just being an over-glorified edge lord worshiped by the mainstream mass of sensationalists, I can more than happily say that Blue Gender is (perhaps unfortunately?) sits behind the obscurity corner within the likes of many 90’s good shit, which is only consumed by the enlightened – but please recommend to casuals so they can join the Reich.Blue Gender stands out for combining three awesome things: sci-fi survival horror, social critique and creepy as fuck aliens who make the Titans looks like a bunch...of wankers. And sex – presented in a way that is reasonable!So don’t expect any Dues ex Machina ass writing, like it’s your trivial shounen.

While that does have its own advantages which I won’t elaborate or I’ll be writing until Christmas – what makes the first half of Blue Gender so much better than these types of shows is that the Blues (creepy ass, overgrown alien parasites who want to eat you in your sleep) can kill anyone, at any time and that no one is safe - anywhere. You see people trying to recover whatever sanity they have left from the trauma of fighting these aliens and the co-operation of the wanderers and soldiers are done so for the sake of survival or for their own well-being to help out.Even with this ‘monster of the week’ formula, there is insight in terms of ethical issues by surviving – notably episode four.

Or nature? The link between humanity and nature, so humanity must die from nature because man has fucked the Earth so damn much? Not being Arkada here, the ending is a bit vague and out of my expectations.Overall, Blue Gender is a classic that is a must-watch for all the AoT weebs who think Eren is the subversion of Shinji, and that anything with loads of character deaths is a masterpiece.

I found the characters to be depth less and redundant, even the attempts at making the locals seem personable seemed to fall on itself. The overall combination of non realism combined with the attempts at bringing science into the mix left me horrified at the result. I forced myself to continue watching this abomination in a desperate hope that it might be brought to a well written close but sadly I have to say I...enjoyed the ending to the third brolly movie more than I did this. After finishing this I feel as though I should need to request for some reward for completing it or if nothing else my time misspent back. enjoyed the ending to the third brolly movie more than I did this.

Military mecha done right unlike the painfully slow Gasaraki, also from this same director. It starts off right in the action with a heartpounding sequence as Yuji's stasis pod is raced down a blue infested hallway. It's a show don't tell kind of storytelling that respects the viewer enough to initially figure out for themselves what kind of world this is and what happened to it.From the introduction it becomes a thrilling survival series and even elements of a budding romance as Yuji and Marlene learn to build trust in one another and Yuji manages...to break through Marlene's detachment, a detachment necessary for any soldier in this world who knows any mission is likely to be their last.However, once Yuji and Marlene arrive on Second Earth and complete the initial goal of the series things start to deteriorate. The suspense in this part of Marlene sneaking around the space station to find the whereabouts of Yuji pales in comparison to what she faced down on Earth. Watching her go through all of these drawn the same corridors is a real slog for the viewer.Then once the purpose of Yuji is discovered all of his character development is thrown out the window for a complete 180 in personality. A main villain is introduced and taking him down becomes the main focus instead of survival. However, the villain is just another typical nihilistic psycho.I really liked this show in the beginning but the second half just was not as enjoyable for me. Still a great mecha show. My only other complaint is sometimes the mecha seemed undefined to me and hard to distinguish from one another.I wish we could've seen more Earth based missions with the regular soldiers like Marlene. If I had to go with a better ending, I would've made getting to Second Earth the end of the show and the purpose of Yuji being a way to ultimately defeat the blue with his genetics. to break through Marlene's detachment, a detachment necessary for any soldier in this world who knows any mission is likely to be their last.However, once Yuji and Marlene arrive on Second Earth and complete the initial goal of the series things start to deteriorate.

This is only fair because ideas have been used constantly and I do not see a reason to hold it against a show for ""recycling"" an idea.That being said Blue Gender deals with a menace that has wiped out most of the population of earth, and a group of humans on a space station trying to reclaim the planet. I recommend it to those who like war, mecha, emotional conflict, and great depictions of the...horrors of warfare. I, however found the story killed itself in the last few episodes, and ended up not making much sense. For those who wish to stop reading now my overall score is a 7, it is worth watching.For those still with me lets talk about the good points first.ART -  Blue Gender has a retro style art, and does a fine job of it. It is a style that some hate and some love. I would rather see great retro art, specifically in the battle scenes, than CGI and shortcuts.SOUND - The op and ed are fantastic. The BGM through out the show is suspenseful, creepy, and inspiring exactly when needed.CHARACTERS - This is really where Blue Gender shines. Each character is fleshed out and has a reason for acting accordingly. The New Earth soldiers are given a reason they devalue existing humans on the planet, and the sleepers are given a reason to act the way they do. It is also shown exactly why person A is attached to person B. I respect this in a series. That said I still felt a detachment towards the characters personally, and did not get upset when one (or many) died, but I can not fault the anime.STORY - This was the biggest fault for me. The story alluded to some reasons why the Blues existed, then threw away all of that in the last few episodes and went with the most trite reason possible. Even then at the ending of the last episode with no explanation a major event happens for no reason. Even the awful reason for the Blues existence does not explain away why this happens, and they do not even have the common decency to try to explain it.FINAL - Blue Gender could be a perfect example of how harsh human reality, war, loss, suffering, and hope collide.

The latter and their development are arguably the strongest point of this series. Their interactions and motivations are decently structured and add weight to the overall plot. Especially the bond shared between the main 2 characters is central to...the plot and meaning of Blue Gender.The overall plot starts strong, keeps it up somewhat in the middle and later mellows out a bit until a rather sudden end.The production quality is  decent, with the music standing out especially favoribly.

First off Blue Gender is an anime jam packed with action and gruesome but ever so satisfying visuals. The show is in fact a mech however the mechs seem to me to be implemented into the story with far greater use than many other mech series i have seen. Secondly the character development is basically the basis of the whole show and is extremely interesting to see how the characters in the story change over the course of time and the events that transpire. Overall I...found this anime very satisfying with a great story, great cast of characters, and awesome amounts of action that aren't dragged out as many other anime do. I highly recommend this anime to those who are action fans that also like a little bit of a romance twist in their anime. found this anime very satisfying with a great story, great cast of characters, and awesome amounts of action that aren't dragged out as many other anime do.

Upon first watch, Blue Gender became a top favorite for me.  Upon second watch, it still was a top favorite for me.Story:The story may not be very original with alien bugs vs. humans in a post-apocalyptic world.  Starship Troopers had that done apparently, but Blue Gender I felt had executed itself very well.  It starts off with Yuji, waking up to an Earth that is overrun by aliens call ""Blue"".  As the story goes on, we learn as much as Yuji does, and see that...the characters start to drive the story in different ways than the actual story itself, which is a plus.  The pacing is pretty quick, with maybe a few unneeded episode, for me that was the one in the desert, although Dice was a good character to meet, but that\'s for talking about later.Art:The art style I really did like alot.  It had a semi-realistic art style, Seinin-like and some nice double-shading.  Although the art is the lowest point in Blue Gender.  Some parts just looked very bland which were very noticeable.  And drawing some characters had quite a bit of flaws, with uneven eyes or other proportions, especially from far-away but they did look pretty funny at least, and goes to show that this show came from good ol\' hand-drawing.Another plus though was the designs of the Blue and the Armored Shrikes.  They were pretty great and I really wanted to know much more about them, sadly there isn\'t much.Sound:The sound effects in Blue Gender were executed quite well.  Great, horrific sounds and crunching and blood splatters, all added to the fun of Blue Gender.The OST though, that\'s where everything falls in place.  It is fantastic, each piece of music gives a devastating feeling to the atmosphere, giving it a ""scary"" feel if I should say.  This, I feel, is how horror anime should have their soundtrack.Character:Now for one of the higher parts of the show: The characters.  I felt that everyone was about as realistic as they could be, well at least most.Yuji Kaido especially, who flips his personality about 4 times throughout the 26-episode series, was one hell of a fun experience to enjoy.  His adaption to such a post-apocalyptic world was also enjoyable to see, and how he had wanted to help out.  Of course he questions the political aspects of it and Second Earth, which is something I would personally do as well.Marlene also undergone much development, with having more of a ""heart"" as Yuji had at the beginning.  She learns from others despite what she was thoughts, questioning if Second Earth was actually any good.  It was also an enjoyable thing to see.I could go on and on, but overall, the characters are great, they lead the story more than the story telling itself, which makes it much more unique.Enjoyment:Blue Gender was very enjoyable to me.  I love just about every minute of it, even the episodes I didn\'t like so much, but I still found things to like for reasons stated before.Overall:I had tons of fun watching this anime and re-watching it.

I feel as if Blue Gender is often overlooked and under rated by the anime community because of similarities to other anime. But Blue Gender I think is one of those anime where you can get even a non anime fan to enjoy simply because of its horror and scifi story line. The one complaint I have about Blue Gender is the writing, I feel that the two main characters, Yuji and Marlene, move too quickly in their 'character development'. They swap personalities half way through the show practically and then change again after that. But other then that...I find the story fascinating and actually realistic for the most part. I could do without all the sex and the phallic imagery, but in the end it doesn't bother me too much. I would have liked a more explained ending, it leaves me with lots of questions and wondering what happens next. Im sure that was the point, and then of course the movie brings me nothing new to ease my mind. If youre into scifi then this is definitely a good watch for you. And ignore the Mecha aspect, its not really essential to the story (like in Evangelion or Gundam) The art isnt the best, but I do love the character designs and the animation is never bad. Blue Gender probably has one of my favorite OST's of all time. I has some of the most chilling and haunting music ever. Everyone should give Blue Gender a chance and wait until the very end until making any judgements. I find the story fascinating and actually realistic for the most part.

The story is not very special either, unfortunately.The gist of it is this, there is a character that totally sucks at playing army guy but eventually shifts to being an overwhelming badass while the badass chick eventually becomes the damsel of distress and always has to be carried. It\'s a cliche about love and women being useless the moment a guy is in the spotlight.I am not by any means overly liberal, but I am somewhat salty because you went from having an interesting character that also happens to be female...to now a character that feels like she is slowly getting more and more mediocre and hopeless. She still has her moments, but it felt too inconsistent. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but that was my overall impression. She went from always being the lead badass to being that one character that can keep up good enough to be in the same scene as the more important character, but she isn\'t consistent enough to be considered the badass she was once portrayed as.

The premise is that the earth's been taken over by gigantic bugs bent on killing all the humans.  The humans flee to a space station called second earth, but eventually come back to pick up humans called sleepers who were in cryo until that time.  That's where the anime starts off a it's quite an intriguing story.However, this anime's storyline lacked direction in a major way.  I enjoyed the pace and the characters seemed deep enough.  However, the characters end up being fairly...static in their development and the story just kind of meanders around until the final episodes where they try to explain everything.  The explanations end up being silly and preachy.  After watching all of those episodes I wonder whether I was simply watching them so I could watch Marlene's breasts bobbing up and down at the closing credits.Artwork and sound were both subpar for a 1999 anime so this had to have been pretty low budget.  I swear they reused the same bug screech in every episode.If your bored and love sci-fi then you may as well give this one a try.

It seemed like an evangelion-esque ending that didn't follow through.The animation was also pretty mediocre and didn't age well.

The main character is awaken from cold sleep after several decades and is needed to help save Earth from the creatures once and for all. Mechs included.There\'s many positives to point out. The story is always changing things up and keeping the characters moving. One location to the next. Sometimes its man vs. insect, and sometimes its human vs. human conflicts. The show has a great musical score and sound effects for the guns, insects, and machinery which goes a long way in building atmosphere...and weight to scenes. The violence is brutal and you feel the intensity of the action. The show was able to keep my interest for the entire run time and rarely hit pacing issues. If you love post apocalyptic anime, then you will probably enjoy this show despite its flaws.The main issues that really drag down the show from potential greatness is the animation and the main character. The animation is very rough and was distracting countless times. Shots are reused, badly inserted animation on top of backgrounds, and other eye sores that needed polishing. Even for shows AIC was producing around the same time such as ""Now and Then, Here and There"", its below average quality.

To be fair, the show sets up the character to be this way in the story, and had the show handled it better i would have had no problem with it.

Then right around episode 11 or 12, it surprised me again - in a terrible way.First, let\'s address something: in a typical science fiction anime (or any story in general), the character goes through a typical hero\'s journey, with the added element of confronting the scientific unknown - which is usually new, strange, and either cool or scary or maybe both. After the MC\'s first encounters with that unknown, they have their first conflict and end up learning a little more about this new world, maybe even gaining their footing in the process....Then MC encounters even worse conflict, realizes they have to overcome the problems of their inner psyche in order to win, and either succeeds or fails in doing so.In the first half of Blue Gender, we get our MC confronting the unknown: in this case, Yuji wakes up from being cryogenically frozen to a post-apocalyptic monstrous nightmare. However, Yuji never really finds his footing in this new world, or if he does, it comes significantly later in the first season. Instead, Blue Gender presents a high-anxiety, relentless struggle for survival, with an MC who is mysteriously valuable to the government big wigs but who is otherwise never able to get a hold on the situation. Some of my most tense and compelling viewing experiences occurred while watching this show: throughout the initial episodes, one expects Yuji and Marlene to gain some kind of advantage, but instead it feels as though Marlene is the lonely soldier carrying everyone through the wilderness, with one small mistake leading to Yuji\'s (or her own) death. It reminded me, in some ways, of the Pitch Black film - which is as good a sign as any.This journey of survival lasts a while. I think some would it find it a bit dragged out, and perhaps I did grow impatient at times. But there\'s something perfectly brilliant about how high the stakes are and how harsh the consequences. I remember a beautiful scene on top of a mountain in which the loneliness comes to a head, in which the fight to live never seemed so exhausting and revealing about Yuji and Marlene\'s characters.We reach the end of season 1, moving into season 2. The fight to survive ends as the characters reach their ultimate goal. It\'s fascinating and exciting and relieving all at once to see them make it. And what is Second Earth exactly? How will our characters react to this new world? What awaits them now?Then, the story takes a giant shit on everything fascinating and wonderful about the first several episodes. It says, ""Ok, the hard stuff for the characters is done now."" Their journey no longer seems to impact them like it should, not even the memory of it. We learn why the government wants Yuji recovered, and the reason is so cliche and disappointing, I still wince when thinking about it. We get new characters who are supposed to have interesting new interactions and relationships with the MC, all of which falls flat. The MC\'s goal has changed from ""live and get off Earth"" to ""become a strong pilot, I guess, because I am special.""I had to stop very quickly after that. It was truly mediocre, perhaps far worse than that. After all of the bloody and psychological struggles to get off Earth, I ended up wishing they hadn\'t left it.

It has a bit of everything—action, depression, post-nut clarity, suspense, a little bit of mystery, and sex ;).While the story is simple, it never stops taking a break. The MC goes through an understandable journey from a timid guy to a full-blown chad.The music was decent, it wasn\'t bad nor great. It fitted the mood whenever necessary.The art is obviously going to be outdated (duh, it\'s from the 90s). But it never got in the way of my viewing.There are several notable characters that have exciting arcs. Some characters you learn to love and then later you learn...to hate that same person again, or vice versa.The end was wtf. But it was still enjoyable with the MC bagging a baddie in the end. In my book, that counts as a win.Overall, if you are looking for a series that isn\'t afraid to be a little ""brutal"", and simple yet enjoyable then it is for you. to hate that same person again, or vice versa.The end was wtf.

Humans built a base in space orbit (Second Earth) and work on ways to exterminate the insects to make the planet inhabitable. The story is focused on Kaido Yuji, a guy who was diagnosed incurable illness so he decided to be put to sleep and wait for the future when the cure will be developed. He wakes up in middle of the fight between humans and insects, freaking out with sudden change and how the world turned upside-down. The humans were on a mission to save him and others who were...asleep, and to bring them back to Second Earth. The further events are full of encounters and dread which shake his psyche and force him to accept the reality and adapt to it.The anime really shines in the atmosphere - varies from claustrophobia and tense to true face of cruel world with all the obstacles, feeling they are on their own and grimy theme that the world is a very dark and unfriendly place. The sound, art, character reactions blend so well sometimes to make the impact in the representation. The art and sound are very good, even mecha and fights are alright, and those are the only positive points about the show. Some moments in first episodes were so good I\'d easily give them 9/10, but it\'s time to get on negative parts.Even though the story is simple and alright, the way it unfolds and twists is often so absurd and makes no sense. Clear plot-holes or forced events happen that some characters lose brain for a period of time that a new subplot can start, which makes me think whether to put characters as nothing but plot gears, starting the protagonist Yuji. He is one of my biggest complaints and one of the worst and most annoying protagonists I\'ve seen so far - he behaves like a 12 year old brat with memory of goldfish. He feels like a merely plot trigger - his idiotic actions are the cause of events which bring nothing but trouble  and death to everyone around him (I wonder why wasn\'t he tied and put in the trunk). Completely ignoring orders, making noise, running off and lecturing others on ""morals"" even though they saved his life countless amount of time. Then he turns 180 degrees over night and starts preaching the philosophy he hated so much just hours and and later forgets about it. The subplot with the girl and the dog felt so forced and artificial (especially the promises and participating in such unnecessary danger) that it was unbearable to watch. I guess that creators wanted to push him through the events to make him question his beliefs and adapt to the new world he woke up in, but it was very poorly executed. All other characters are either angels or douchebags who make nothing but trouble for plot reasons. Oh, what about the romance? Most of the time it ends in either one of them being insanely dense while the other is yelling the other one\'s name all the time and then comes the impact which is supposed to cause emotions in the watcher but it fails miserably or makes them laugh. Also a plenty of action is terrible and serves nothing to show someone as a good/bad guy or give plot armor to someone to carry on with task - a plenty of scenes have only 2-3 people doing action while all others are mere audience, even if they are guards who are supposed to catch someone in a small room.The show has some really great moments but sadly they are shunned by immeasurable absurdity of the plot and the characters. Things make less sense later, some things are forgotten, then the show turns into some harem/slice of life/whatever thing and I couldn\'t have stomached it anymore. The show can be much more enjoyable if you ignore all the nonsense but even that amount annoyed hell out of me. Sorry if this conclusion is a mess because the show doesn\'t deserve it, being nothing more but an artificial nonsense.*SPOILER ALERT*I\'ll give here few examples of absurdity or forced events, I didn\'t count much but some of them baffled me.The event while Dice, Yuji and Marlene were in a buggy driving through the desert, they fought a flying insect and Yuji fell out the buggy. Just after that was a scene of some nomad woman saving Yuji, even though Dice and Marlene searched the place! That subplot was pretty wacky - peaceful nomads whose female member drooled over Yuji, while Mad Max villains appeared out of nowhere to terrorize good guys, then of course Yuji showed them who\'s the boss in such awful action scene where everyone stood like mannequins and let him do all the work.Episode 10-11 where guy named Han was obsessed about a sleeper and attempted to screw his whole team to go with herself alone into the space in a space shuttle, not with others too. His 180 degree turn was laughable and his excuse pathetic - where would they go if not on Second Earth? It didn\'t make any sense, creators just shifted the guy to become mad.Also upon team reaching Second Earth, everyone on the space station is a douchebag and punishes others for no reason. Military heads not demanding full report from Marlene but for plot/drama sake keep yelling nonsense and punishing... I hope you get my point. It\'s not the issue that the anime has some plot/characters/logic issues, it has way too much of them. The only character I sorta liked was Dice, he felt out of place and managed to create some chemistry with characters, but he was ditched shortly afterwards. asleep, and to bring them back to Second Earth.

Sorry if this conclusion is a mess because the show doesn\'t deserve it, being nothing more but an artificial nonsense.*SPOILER ALERT*I\'ll give here few examples of absurdity or forced events, I didn\'t count much but some of them baffled me.The event while Dice, Yuji and Marlene were in a buggy driving through the desert, they fought a flying insect and Yuji fell out the buggy. Just after that was a scene of some nomad woman saving Yuji, even though Dice and Marlene searched the place! That subplot was pretty wacky - peaceful nomads whose female member drooled over Yuji, while Mad Max villains appeared out of nowhere to terrorize good guys, then of course Yuji showed them who\'s the boss in such awful action scene where everyone stood like mannequins and let him do all the work.Episode 10-11 where guy named Han was obsessed about a sleeper and attempted to screw his whole team to go with herself alone into the space in a space shuttle, not with others too. His 180 degree turn was laughable and his excuse pathetic - where would they go if not on Second Earth? It didn\'t make any sense, creators just shifted the guy to become mad.Also upon team reaching Second Earth, everyone on the space station is a douchebag and punishes others for no reason. Military heads not demanding full report from Marlene but for plot/drama sake keep yelling nonsense and punishing... I hope you get my point. It\'s not the issue that the anime has some plot/characters/logic issues, it has way too much of them. The only character I sorta liked was Dice, he felt out of place and managed to create some chemistry with characters, but he was ditched shortly afterwards.', 'Ho boy... Where do I even start?This wasn\'t my first time watching Blue Gender - I remember watching it as a kid some time in the mid-to-late 2000s. For some reason, my kid self wasn\'t as shocked by this anime as my present-day 30-year old boomer self. Maybe I watched a censored version, or maybe I just couldn\'t conceptualise and comprehend all the violence and gore as a kid, but... I dunno. So basically, this was my second time watching Blue Gender.Where was I going again?Right, so Blue Gender. Great anime, but absolutely not for the faint-hearted. It contains a ton of violence, gore and...even sex, so if you find those stuff yucky, or are easily traumatized by character deaths, then this isn\'t the anime for you.Let\'s start by facing the elephant in the room right away: to say that it was heavily influenced by both Starship Troopers and Neon Genesis Evangelion would be a huge understatement. It\'s practically a perfect marriage of those two, just without the humour - it is much more serious and deeper than either of those. The way the anime casually kills off named characters without any mercy reminds me of Game of Thrones (though we all know that the main protagonist and his love interest had the benefit of Plot Armor).The animation is so good that it makes me want to cry - they sure don\'t make \'em like that anymore! I liked the intro song too. While there are several things I object to in this anime, if there\'s one thing the creators got right, it\'s visual storytelling: show, don\'t tell. And that is precisely what they did. They sure showed us. Sometimes, still shots tell more than even a thousand words of exposition, and the creators of Blue Gender understood that arguably better than anyone.And here\'s where this review turns somewhat negative: plot, or rather, lack thereof.  Spoiler alert, but here it goes: our story begins with Yuuji awakening in a world that is completely different from the one he slept in. He gets rescued, but things don\'t go according to plan, and he becomes part of a Starship Trooper-esque crusade against TEH BUGS... sorry, I mean, the Blues. Lots of characters die, and then the plot eventually turns into a copy of Neon Genesis Evangelion, just with a green, environmentalist message - a message I disagree with, by the way. Basically, things progress from bad to worse, and we end up with our main protagonist living as a Neolithic primitive, rejecting any and all technology more advanced than the wheel.The way I see it, it was good(ish) until around the 20th episode, when it kinda began to turn downhill - I liked Episodes 1-12, I kinda liked 12-20 too (just less so), but it really started going downhill at 20 with the forced message. I\'m still giving it a 7/10 though.I don\'t want to get political at all on an anime review, but the idea that technology is evil is just silly. The role of technology is to reduce the impact each individual has on the planet - do you have any idea just how much land would be needed to sustain 8 billion hunter-gatherers? Do you have any idea just how many species of megafauna were driven into extinction by our Paleolithic hunter-gatherer ancestors? With this knowledge in your head, the notions of technology being ""evil"" and making Gaia sad or more primitive peoples being ""more in tune with nature"" and having less of a harmful impact on Earth just seem laughably silly and blatantly false, and rightfully so.I loved the anime, but I strongly disagree with its Luddite message. But hey, it\'s just an anime, no need to get myself so worked up over that.It\'s an otherwise decent anime whose last episodes and ending are ruined by a forced message delivered in a ham-fisted way. even sex, so if you find those stuff yucky, or are easily traumatized by character deaths, then this isn\'t the anime for you.Let\'s start by facing the elephant in the room right away: to say that it was heavily influenced by both Starship Troopers and Neon Genesis Evangelion would be a huge understatement.

There\'s no convoluted story nor adrenaline rush scenes.

I think for anyone who's looking for more sci-fi stories, this is definitely worth at least checking out. I was happy to see that this didn't turn out to be an Evangelion knock-off like it first started off being too.My problems mainly lie with the story itself however, I think this series was trying to do too much and it didn't blend well. It was confusing to change perspectives between characters and go from psychological horror to a romance back to psychological horror and repeated. At points, the series felt like a drag, and other times I was deeply invested....Towards the end gets really good, and I'm glad it stays consistently good till the end.

Contrary to most anime which pop out at the audience with characters with exaggerated personalities, funny moments, and other ""tropey"" things, Blue Gender is one of the more serious and mature shows out there. Personally, I like anime that take themselves and their world seriously, but this show does have me a little mixed in my opinions.Things that I liked about it were the creatures (which were cool and terrifying), the world itself, which although bleak, was also mysterious and kept you on edge the whole way through, and various features of...the plot. I will say I respect the show for not holding back, presenting stakes and real danger without holding back punches; I was pleasantly surprised and shocked with many of the plot decisions of the story. And even though it\'s an old anime, it grainy dated look only adds to the atmosphere in my opinion, and the animation is decent enough.My issues however would be that I feel like there were very little cast members to grow emotionally attached to.

It’s a basic “talking animal” cartoon, where an ox named Ollie keeps a farm going with the mixed help and interference from his fellow animal friends.However, the show is good and solid fun: the jokes are easy to understand and laugh at. And it has a unique multicultural background: it was based on a Dutch comic, animated by a Japanese company (director Hiroshi Sasagawa is the genius behind the classic animes SPEED RACER and VOLTRON) and is dubbed in English by a veteran voice cast from Saban Entertainment (the studio behind POWER RANGERS)....On the whole, it’s a good watch for children, and for older viewers it’s enjoyable once in a while.

High Card Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54869/High_Card_Season_2,"[""Here we are at the conclusion of this sublime season 2 and, at the risk of offending some, I find this sequel all the more accomplished than s1. I risk going against everyone's grain, but let's take it point by point.We find ourselves in a season that reveals a plethora of things about the history of this universe, how the card system works, our characters' pasts, and especially the link between Finn and this Dark Knight. I won't go into too much detail about the story to avoid spoilers. Instead, I'll concentrate on the technical aspects and the storyline.DA: 8.5Animation: 8.3OST's : 10The technical aspect...remains just as high quality as in season 1. Despite a few moments that were a little average, notably on the characters' faces, the overall animation was really well done. I'm thinking in particular of the Theo/Ban fight in the cemetery and the final confrontation in episode 12. As for the AD, I was blown away by the series' consistency in offering us a subtle blend between a monarchical universe typical of the Middle Ages and a certain modernity reminiscent of the United Kingdom. As for the series' greatest quality, it's obviously the ost's without a doubt. Jazz is my favorite musical style, so maybe I'm a little biased, but I found this soundtrack simply perfect. To blend flute and saxophone so seamlessly to create such upbeat jazz shows great talent but also great knowledge of this musical world.History: 8Characters: 9Character development: 8.5Worldbuilding :However, despite a rich and complex universe, there were times when I found myself a little lost in the various explanations, particularly those surrounding the creation of the Joker, his purpose and the true history of the kingdom of Fourland. As for the characters and their development, we find ourselves in a fairly classic construction, but one that works very well in this case. Ban and Theodore's flashbacks moved me, and their confrontations were the pinnacle of their development. As for the story, it was greatly fleshed out in season 2. The end of s1 was a bit of a letdown for me, but this s2 brought me back to the series after that slight loss of interest.I'll end my review by saying that this series is the perfect compromise for anime fans and fans of works such as Kingsman. Despite a final rating as catastrophic as that of Blue Exorcist Illuminati saga (I seriously don't understand the fans), I recommend that you ignore the rating and embark on this incredible story that will take you through a rollercoaster of emotions and leave an indelible mark, just like 91 Days can. remains just as high quality as in season 1.

If you remember that show ""The Great Pretender,"" despite the main character being initially a bit of a clutz, all the other side characters were already 4D chess-playing, 150 IQ geniuses that could see 20 moves ahead. It may have been silly sometimes, but it gave the impression that the main character had joined an elite team of professionals. In High Card, every single one of the agents in the team the main character joins, besides...the old man, is incompetent to an embarrassing degree, to the point it makes you wonder why make a setting with secret agents at all.Only once does it ever feel like they plan something out, cleverly use their abilities, or just not come off as a complete burden to the team and their mission. In this season, they know one of their targets has an ability that grants him super speed, so the main character\'s plan turns out to be: to chase him on foot without a strategy like a complete amateur with no backup (this guy btw, is a veteran agent). Do you want to know how they catch this guy? By sheer dumb fucking luck, a building collapses, the speedster helps save the civilians, and they just grab him when he lets his guard down. The head of the agency gets captured by the main bad guys and the group just, sits around on their asses doing nothing, despite having no other boss telling them to do so. One of the members has an ability that is a completely uncontrollable wildcard that can be dangerous to themselves, and yet she just pulls it out willy-nilly at the first sign of trouble (which usually ends up as a problem for the rest of the team). It makes the tone of this show outright baffling.I feel like I\'m watching Power Rangers but with cards and ""secret agents"" instead of cool martial arts and superheroes. But Power Rangers knows what it\'s going for and has fun with it, meanwhile, High Card is constantly trying to fall back into a serious tone with tragic heroes/villains, murder of civilians and police, and a grand vast magic conspiracy involving the royal family. And it just doesn\'t work.

It\'s Showdown!""...for real this time.Out with the casual play, and into the real foot of the drama, at least for the continuation of High Card, the creation and next succession from Kakegurui mangaka Homura Kawamoto, Mikaru Kuno and TMS Entertainment\'s evolution of bringing the poker play into a global stage.With Season 1, it serves as the establishment of a poker-playing world: bound by the entire stack of 52 X-Playing Cards which all has a different power used for the gains of anyone who picks it up, it certainly is a wild goose chase for trying to...be pseudo-Kingsman trying to accomplish the task of capturing all the Cards. That is only the first step, and the second with all characters left, right and center doing their ultimate best at achieving their plans within the organizations that they serve for: High Card under Pinochle, their next competitive rival Who\'s Who, and the mafia organization of the Klondike Family.Season 2 here, continues that trend by going back in time to the real plot of how these X-Playing Cards were formulated, and how through the Kingdom of Fourland, these Cards have gone out of control through sheer greed and temptation of its powers, and connect a world where the Cards signify peace and harmony, or a pure monocle of destruction.And the main person most affected by this is Finn Oldman, who is now Chris Redgrave\'s superior (because of his attempt to play an X-Hand of 5 cards to save his sister, only to fail and be demoted from his position), on figuring out his real past since he was an orphan living in the Sun Fields Orphanage. This however, involves a very highly sought afer X-Playing Card: the King of Spades, ""San Galgano"" a.k.a the Black Knight, which is in direct relation with Finn\'s past, and the family that the entity destroyed from his childhood, enough to sworn High Card\'s newcomer for revenge. The Card, residing at Tilt, the young executive of the Klondike Family, is a very powerful tool that works a ton for the user, but its consequence outweigh the benefits as he/she becomes the aforementioned Black Knight, who will take full control of the user with its own consciousness and motives. And as it turns out, the plot of Finn and San Galgano takes precedence for the 2nd half of the series, all while changes within the royal family of Fourland are experiencing shake-ups of their own, as well as the police force with Greg Young and Sugar Peace, not to mention the continued rivalry of Pinochle and Klondike for the Cards. It\'s quite a mess that stems from time millennia of the creation of the X-Playing Cards, with all of its issues brought forth since the very beginning of the series. This journey, unlike the glitz and glamour of Season 1, will be a harsh reality to face for Season 2 with its change of tone.Speaking of tones, everything has remained the same thus far, from Studio Hibari\'s production to the music. The tonal changes also reflect on the OP/ED theme songs, of which Five New Old is back with another OP song, a subtle one to reflect the darkness of the 2nd half, though it\'s decent at best and quite different from its banger Season 1 counterpart. Raon\'s melancholic ED song this time is also fine, though I can\'t quite find myself clicking with it unfortunately.With the serious tones, High Card experiences yet another low, not just in retention rates, but also the shift in story elements (which proves essential from Season 1\'s setup) which is understandable and yet not all too difficult to be cognizant of it\'s part in the big storyline. I feel that this could\'ve been better if some rational choices were done, but it is what it is, and for an alter-Kakegurui with the same high-stakes game, it\'s fine as an overall product.Still, High Card is and will still remain as an underappreciated show, and I quite honestly...don\'t mind that at all, when all is said and done. be pseudo-Kingsman trying to accomplish the task of capturing all the Cards.

Initially when I watched episodes 1 to 4 it was fine and quite good but after that that was where my disappointment began.I can\'t say that the anime is boring or not worth watching, but when you watch it you will definitely feel that this is an average anime because the story is fast and compelling.One of the most glaring issues with Season 2 of...this anime is its pacing, which feels rushed and forced. The plot moves at breakneck speed, with crucial character developments, plot twists, and emotional moments crammed into each episode. As a result, the narrative lacks depth and fails to fully explore the intricate nuances of the story and its characters.The fast pacing not only detracts from the overall viewing experience but also undermines the impact of pivotal moments within the series. Scenes that should have been given the opportunity to unfold naturally and build suspense are instead glossed over, leaving viewers feeling disconnected and unsatisfied.Furthermore, the forced pacing of Season 2 gives the impression that the creators were more concerned with pushing the plot forward quickly rather than allowing it to organically evolve. This approach sacrifices the integrity of the storytelling and diminishes the emotional resonance that made Season 1 so compelling.Additionally, the rushed pacing of Season 2 exacerbates other issues within the series, such as inconsistencies in character development and lackluster world-building. Without sufficient time to delve into the intricacies of the story and its universe, this anime fails to live up to its full potential and leaves viewers craving a more fulfilling viewing experience.Overall, Season 2 of High Card falls short of expectations due to its forced and fast pacing. While the series may still hold some appeal for fans of the franchise, it ultimately fails to deliver the depth, complexity, and emotional impact that made its predecessor so beloved.

While the series may still hold some appeal for fans of the franchise, it ultimately fails to deliver the depth, complexity, and emotional impact that made its predecessor so beloved. As a viewer, I can\'t help but feel disappointed by the missed opportunity to further explore the rich tapestry of High Card\'s world.', ""My main problem with this show is that it has a chronic problem with its identity. I found S1 painfully average but saw some potential. And I wanted to give S2 the chance to let it land, and so far its getting worse.It has no idea what it wants to be and because of this it doesn't do anything well. It's trying to juggle so many elements within the plot that it ends up bouncing from uninteresting character to uninteresting character. For me, the only character I found remotely interesting (that actually got more than 5 mins of screen time mind you) was Leo....He got most of episode 5 dedicated to him, and they even messed that up. Episode 5 perfectly represented everything wrong with this show - Poor. Execution.Another reviewer for S1 thought that High Card was advertised to be a mix of Kingsman and Bungou Stray Dogs and that's what I thought too. But it isn't either of them. It isn't anything. It doesn't deliver anything comedic and wacky. The way the characters use the Cards is laughably incompetent. The plot is very weak mainly due to the worldbuilding and characters being so flat and devoid of any substance or care.The best way I can describe this show is that its a really bad Power Rangers adaptation that takes itself too seriously. Ultimately, I really wanted to like this show. It has great potential. But if only did it focus more on its narrative structure then it would have delivered on what it actually wanted to be.

In the end, it did although in a mish mash of ups and downs.On the one hand, the character we grew attached too found themselves in much higher stakes, leading to them growing closer not only with themselves but within each other, doing sometimes introspections upon the situation. My personal favorite, Chris, fortunately kept up with...his charismatic personality from the first season and with the addition of a new roster of villains and distant acquaintances, the narrative was set for a huge number of reveals.And on that note we certainly had our fair share of twists and flips which sometimes changed our perspective on the cards and the story as a whole. As we went along this season the kingdom of Fourland was presented as having more things up its sleeve than met the eye and the card powers being revealed conducted a flush of events which raised the tension to unprecedented states. Unfortunately, this sometimes came in the detriment of the classy vibes that the first season had at play.Indeed, on the other hand the animation wasn't spectacular by any means more so compared to other big hits from the season. The use of CGI during relevant scenes as well as the lack of depth in some facial expressions or background characters made for a foul first impression upon newcomers. Regarding the music, it did its job fine enough with the opening sequence staying as its flagship and the sound effects of the cards befitting their respective powers.All in all, if you were looking for the continuation of the last season, this one certainly counts as one. It's nothing spectacular and by the halfway point you may be tempted to fold it under the dropped category. However, by the end you'll most probably come around to it, going all in as the final episode comes around. Heck, you might even start browsing for a sale of the featured deck, not that I haven't tried that yet. his charismatic personality from the first season and with the addition of a new roster of villains and distant acquaintances, the narrative was set for a huge number of reveals.And on that note we certainly had our fair share of twists and flips which sometimes changed our perspective on the cards and the story as a whole.

Cuties is the 4th installment of the hayate no gotoku! anime series.Story: 8While many new characters appear in this series compared to the others, it is because this anime follows the current manga chapters (from about 300 i think). Also, the last two episodes are a special ova by Hata Kenjiro himself that gives another alternate ending to the previous season's Can't Take My Eyes Off You!Art: 6Maybe the only negative I would have is the animation. I felt like season 2 JC staff's animations were the best overall in the series, and they should have kept it like that instead...of switching to manglobe.Sound:8The sound overall is suitable to my tastes. The episodes themselves are unique in a way, with a special ED for every character that relates to their personalities.Character: 8The new characters (Kayura, Ruka, Fumi, Sharna, etc) are all expected to appear if you kept up with the series.

But none of this is quite as disappointing as season 4, labeled ""Hayate no Gotoku! Cuties"" and revolving around random events within the lives of the girls of Ayasaki Hayate\'s harem. I really hope I\'m finished watching one of my favorite anime shows plummet to the ground and hopefully if they ever get around to producing a Season 5, it\'ll get back into continuing where the manga left off.I...get it. For writers, the industry calls for new material, all the time, and since writers are the ones pulling the strings for TV scripts as well, it means new material, all the time, and a distinct lack of fear when it comes to pushing new ideas. However, as I\'d like to point out, Hayate no Gotoku! Cuties is one of those new ideas that doesn\'t actually work.Story: While I admit that there are elements of the manga that can be easily translated into this show and the storyline is based on whichever character is the main focus of the episode, the last two episodes are about kissing someone, anyone, to save Sanzenin Nagi from the Black Camellia-wait, what? The Black Camellia incident again?See, as I was told, Hayate no Gotoku! Can\'t Take My Eyes Off You is an epilogue for the series as a whole, although it only takes place a month after the events of the movie. I was more convinced that this would be a [somewhat] fitting end to Hayate\'s harem with the confession that takes place at the end, or whatever you\'d like to call that display of affection. However, the last two episodes of season 4 seem to show otherwise, saying that the Black Camellia incident is still very much happening and it\'s still an issue in those last two episodes. To be honest, it just doesn\'t flow.And what about the fact that the entire plot of the series is crammed within two episodes? I\'d like to think that they just needed a basis by which they\'d end the series, but that\'s definitely not the way I would have ended it either, using the world\'s fastest anime story. Think about it: a season that doesn\'t push a heavy story line like season 3, focusing only on character introductions, yet at the end, something happens. That\'s exactly why the story makes very little sense. It\'s like Stephen Colbert, during any one of his shows, saying, ""oh, by the way, I\'m trying to be serious now."" That just doesn\'t happen, and when it does, it just doesn\'t work.Art: The quality of the animation has improved over the years. It doesn\'t look the way it appears in a manga and a good number of the characters receive a ""style refresh"", but this is the very thing I\'m not too fond of. Sure, the quality is better, but I loved the animation style this show began with in season 1. The animation may have improved the show from then to now, but if I can be anal for one subject out of this entire review, I would much rather prefer the old animation style. Why? The old animation style was used in the first two seasons, which I really, really liked. The new animation style was used for every other installment of the series, which I didn\'t really like. I\'d take the old animation style anytime, just to remind me that at one point in time, this series wasn\'t as disappointing as it is now.Sound: Okay, who really has time to talk about a bang, a beat, and a bop? I came to realize that I have no clue how to judge sound. I might be tone deaf, but I honestly don\'t care.Character: Make the connection from previous seasons, and the only thing that didn\'t change is the cast of characters. They\'re still their same bubbly selves and watching them is always a blast, especially with the new addition of A-tan as a regular character (in past seasons, A-tan got anywhere from a couple seconds of screen time to none at all).A common occurrence in harem shows is the fanbase\'s ability to divide their support amongst the characters. There\'s nothing wrong in that, and as an avid reader of the manga, I can proudly say that I was and have always been a fan of Katsura Hinagiku even after the appearance of Athena Tennousu. But don\'t you get the feeling that the writers are trying to place her in every conceivable situation, without entirely focusing attention on her? That\'s what I feel like is going on. She\'s basically tagging along as support cast. Here\'s a note for the writers next time: we don\'t want to see Katsura Hinagiku. We want to see Katsura Hinagiku, doing things. Having a fan favorite in a slide as an Easter egg doesn\'t make up much of a difference.Enjoyment: Sure, it\'s funny, and sure, it was a great show, but this season 4 is really difficult to watch for me. For the first-time viewer, who hasn\'t seen a single episode of Hayate no Gotoku, this show will be easier to take in, enjoy, and not think too deeply about, but having been a fan of Hayate no Gotoku for a while, watching this particular season was like watching an angel fall from Heaven. You just don\'t want to believe that something so great has come to be so bad, but eventually, you\'ll have to come to terms with it.Overall: If I watched it without having seen the first couple of seasons, I\'m sure I\'d like it a lot more, but having seen the other three seasons, the movie, and the manga, speaking as a fan of the series, this season is one of the last things any one of us would expect to see from a work that used to be so brilliant. If the writers decide to continue writing side stories and straying from the roots of the manga, here\'s my advice: watch the first couple of episodes, decide if you like it, and if not, drop the series and read the manga, which is a hundred times better. get it.

Because there is a lot of new character and the story are different from the previous season. The romance between Hayate and Hinagiku is missing since the third season. It make me very disappointed.ArtThe next part is the artwork. I really really really disappointed from the artwork. The first and second season give a good artwork, but on this season the artwork getting worse. For example, remember Isumi? I really like her on the first and second season. But on fourth season...Isumi became a total stranger for me. Isumi become really creepy and not cute at all. Disappointing.SoundI don\'t have any problem for the sound. And I think there is a little improvement in sound.CharacterIn this season there is many new character. But there isn\'t a story where they came from. And it make me little confused.OverallI really enjoy the first and second season. It\'s really funny and lots of romance stories. But I don\'t find it on this season.

So, those who don't read Manga will be puzzled why there's a sudden appearance of some Characters Like Tennos, Athena, Suirenji, Ruka and other characters...In my Curiousness.. I didn't read the Manga but I only read the Character Wiki instead.. it was enough to explain why Season 4 was like that..Overall it still Entertaining and fun to watch this Season..!! "", 'Hey muchachos, time for me to make my review, but unlike my previous review, I\'m jaz gonna go straight to the point for every category of this anime:Story: Fair 6.There is nada, no story just a different arc in every epsiode, however, the genres comedy, harem, romance and some action are still there and it still makes up for the body of this anime\'s plot.Art: Mediocre 5.Obviously it is still the same but with some minor changes, like the design of the girls uniform and the maid uniforms of Saki and Chiharu that gave them a more sexy look....Sound: Good 7.The score is for the opening theme, which I like and that\'s that.Character: Great 9.It was nice to see different arc that comes along with being with the MC, Hayate. It kinda give that change of scenery as to whom we audience would want to be the MC\'s love interest, for me, I kinda like the Hayate X Hinagiku arc. But, it was quite unfortunate that such arc was only but an appetizer which would never be the main course, basically the word ""cuties"" refers to the female characters that took part in Hayate\'s arc, so the score is for them and not for Hayate whose character was lame.Enjoyment: Good 7.It was nice that though, this anime\'s 4th season was good because of its comedy and harem genre, I limit it to such score since there is that certain corny thing were I would have wish that the main character, Hayate would have been good in noticing the girls feeling for him, instead of being soooo oblivious that such thing is too cliche for this anime as a whole.Overall: Poor 3.Like I\'ve said, for the main character to have that oblivious to a girls feeling kinda thing was too cliche for this anime as a whole, in fact I wouldn\'t advise director Masashi Kudo to make another season if he\'ll keep relying on such cliche, I think its time for him to level up this anime\'s romance that will add spice to this anime and not just keep it in such usual form, also, it wont be bad if new concepts would be added pertaining to the existing characters like Nagi growing up  and Maria was able to be in a relationship with Hayate, just a thought.Adiios.

Gantz 2nd Stage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/395/Gantz_2nd_Stage,"[""The anime version of Gantz is split into two seasons, and I'm reviewing the second season; Gantz - Second Stage. Check my earlier reviews as I have already reviewed the first season of Gantz and the manga version of Gantz.Gantz - Second Stage is a mixed bag since it contains one of the best missions that Gantz has to offer (the Buddha mission), but also contains a lackluster ending to the anime that makes people scratch their heads.The Buddha mission continues where the first season left off, and is highly addictive and kick-ass to watch. It contains everything I love about Gantz; the unpredictability...of who will live; no one is truly safe in the world of Gantz even if you are a main character. The music is even more intense than the first season as you listen to heart pacing guitar licks as the characters battle against the aliens. Everything about this missions is great!Now lets talk about the filler arc. First of all the filler isn't terrible, but it wasn't necessary either. The filler arc is actually pretty good, but left off with a strange ending that most people hated, which leaves the viewer confused with many questions unanswered.A lot of people of people who watched Gantz tell me the same thing: they loved the first three missions featured in the anime but hated the last mission/ ending.*My recommendation is to watch up till episode 21 of the anime series and go straight to CHAPTER 90 in the manga; trust me on this. *The manga will provide you with the answers you didn't have in the anime and becomes even more epic. of who will live; no one is truly safe in the world of Gantz even if you are a main character.

I don\'t know about the manga since I\'ve never took a look on it, perhaps it is a masterpiece without any comparison, but regarding the anime, I couldn\'t have been more disappointed.First things first: the series tries to show a distorted and exaggeratedly negative view of society on which is based a great part of the storytelling, which consists of the saddest and poorest attempts of plot devices. Seriously, the vortex of stupidity wherein...becomes the argument is massive, and that is seen in the senseless acting of the whole cast under any circumstance. ""Wow, this green monster just severed that man\'s head with its bare hands, I\'ve got a gun right here but I\'m not going to use it nor will I run away either, I rather grab the monster from its jacket and yell at it right on its face"". That\'s an humoristic (yet quite literal) interpretation of one of the many stupidities that occur during the first chapters of season one. From the beginning, most of the troubles the characters get into and the subsequent deaths are the result of their apparently NULL common sense. Because of the good reviews I read previously, I kept watching Gantz hoping that nonsenses would eventually come to an end and things would get better. Boy, was I wrong, the absurdities had NO END.Secondly we have all these \'tension and suspense\' scenes when you see people aiming their guns at the aliens they must defeat whilst inwardly saying stuff like ""I\'ve got to shoot, I\'m going to shoot"" but you can leave the chapter playing, go for a snack with a coffee, and then take your sit again only to find out the guy hasn\'t shot yet. This is not suspensive at all, it\'s just boring and stressful, I wanted to get into the show through the screen to grab the gun and shoot by myself... not at aliens, but AT HUMANS! Not only are they completely incoherent about their decisions and behavior, but also they lack of any trace of personality. All of them are characterized by basically one or two traits, and are depressing beings mostly for the sake of being depressing. No personality, no credible personal conflicts or desires, no initiative, just hollow animated figures that won\'t pull the freaking trigger until half the team or so is already dead.After having tolerated all this torture (and I still don\'t know how did I make it) to the final arch of the series, I realized that I was not going to get anything similar to a proper ending. The reward for my patience was an abrupt change of the storytelling, with some empty and pretentious tone of intellectuality and not a single issue about the plot answered. Serioysly, 20+ chapters and you won\'t get any close to at least a hint about what the hell is going on here, you simply don\'t know what the main topic of the story was supposed to be, if it ever had one.Besides the relatively detailed animation (thanks to which we can at least get a handful of well conceived action scenes), the fluency and variation in the approach angles and the intriguing of the plot, I can\'t say nothing in favour to Gantz and I\'ll never understand why so many people think so high of this show. becomes the argument is massive, and that is seen in the senseless acting of the whole cast under any circumstance.

The reward for my patience was an abrupt change of the storytelling, with some empty and pretentious tone of intellectuality and not a single issue about the plot answered. Serioysly, 20+ chapters and you won\'t get any close to at least a hint about what the hell is going on here, you simply don\'t know what the main topic of the story was supposed to be, if it ever had one.Besides the relatively detailed animation (thanks to which we can at least get a handful of well conceived action scenes), the fluency and variation in the approach angles and the intriguing of the plot, I can\'t say nothing in favour to Gantz and I\'ll never understand why so many people think so high of this show.', ""I think overall, the second season of Gantz was my favorite. However, I watched it without even realizing there was a second season at first (I watched all 26 episodes straight.) There wasn't really a break in between the first and second season, at least I could barely tell. If it showed in the opening song, I didn't really watch all of that. Otherwise, this is really a great series.I started watching this only a few days ago and I finished yesterday actually and I really wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't access the site for some reason. And going...to work in between watching this series only made me anxious to continue it yet again. In other words, it was good enough for me to want to go home immediately and watch.Story: The story was good. The characters may irk you but the concept of the story was great. It talks about death and sex a lot and with the topic of death, it certainly gets you thinking, well, if you care about it at all anyway. There's a lot of blood, guts, violence, and gore in this. So...if you're liable to vomiting, get sick, or something like that, then you shouldn't watch this. Otherwise, the story's good besides it's only flaw: the ending. And you all know how that goes usually. Starts out great but ends in a questionable manner. Yeah. Of course, I've heard that the manga is better.Art: I liked the art for the most part. It was good. It wasn't choppy or anything like that. However, when compared to the manga, I guess it just didn't make your stomach turn as much. A few years back, I read the first chapter of the Gantz manga. I was a lot younger but I remember it being quite graphical that I didn't like it and I put it down. But I think it was mostly because the drawings don't move like an anime in which you see the scenes for merely less than a second. Since the drawings don't move, you focus on certain images and it makes it more gory and disgusting. Anyhow, I certainly liked the art went it got further making Kei look really cool.Sound: To be truthful, I don't remember much of the sound effects they used but I'm supposing they weren't using effects that made me cringe with incompatibility. I loved the opening song by RIP SLYME.By the way, I watched the Japanese version and I though the voices were compatible.Character: This is one of those series where you really hate/dislike the character at first (at least in moral sense, some may find them amusing instead) but then later you start to really like them. Well, I'm mainly talking about Kei, the protagonist, who went through the most character development. You start to like certain characters but they soon die off making you mad or sad but they are soon replaced by new members of the Gantz team once again. The most puzzling character is Gantz, and this is also a flaw in the story which doesn't tell us what exactly is going on in the Gantz world.Enjoyment: If you can take blood, guts, violence, sex, immorality, and anything related to that then it's all good. (You might hate some things, but you'll get over it)Overall, I give a 9 because I really liked this anime. I hated the ending since it's so obscure but this certainly helped me give a shot at the manga once again. to work in between watching this series only made me anxious to continue it yet again.

I'm going to celebrate this cheery and wonderful day by ripping apart a shitty, old anime from 10 years ago that nobody cares about and new otaku have probably never even heard of! Why? Because I am an odd man! Today we look at huge #2! Gantz 2: the filler season.Plot and characters: 2/10Is it possible to have a REALLY stupid plot that absolutely revels in its own absurdity, but is still entertaining and awesome? Of course it is! A few series that actually pulled this off well would be: Hellsing Ultimate, Afro Samurai, FLCL, etc. Then there is Gantz, which tries to...go this route and fails hard! One problem with Gantz the anime is that it often takes itself too seriously for a series that is so poorly written and completely idiotic. What do I mean by this? I mean that this is a series about a giant 8ball with a naked man inside (never explained) which orders recently dead people to put on gimp suits and fight random monsters, for...reasons using ridiculously stupid and inefficient guns. Most of these things do get explained eventually in the manga, but this is NOT a well written series. It is supposed to be a big, dumb, action series and not a sophisticated psychological one. The manga actually understands this fact, but the anime...does not.  This is especially true for the 2nd season, which abandons the manga and creates its own final arc. Gantz 2 creates a bunch of god awful filler episodes that desperately try to cram in some morals and philosophical depth to laughable effect. Gantz 2 is like a hybrid of a porno and a Michael Bay film trying to randomly stop mid-explosion or mid-orgasm to spew some freshman level existentialism. It seriously gets so bad that they couldn't think of a real ending, so the assclown writer of this series shamelessly ripped off the Cowboy Bebop ending... WHY?!If you have an absurdist plot that is supposed to be stupid, you need great characters to make up for it. The plot of Hellsing is seriously Count Dracula saving England from Nazi vampires. As amazingly stupid as that is, it works largely because Hellsing has highly likeable and amusing characters. Gantz on the other hand has 2 types of characters: bland and boring, or unlikeable assholes. That is fucking it! None of the characters are cool or badass! None of the characters inspire empathy. None of the characters are even funny! There is not a single...fucking....remotely likeable character in this piece of shit cast.Art: 3/10The art was made by Studio Gonzo in 2004. Be prepared for HORRIBLE CGI, bad backgrounds, and repetitive character designs. This series looks like shit, which is appropriate because it is shit!Sound: 3/10At least the corny J-rap in the beginning is charmingly stupid. I actually do find the Gantz opening amusing. Seriously, I have it on my itunes and laugh my ass off whenever it plays.Overall: 2/10The first series of Gantz was pretty damn bad, but Gantz 2 is just absolute shit! I wouldn't even mind that the series isn't well written or thought provoking if it could actually be entertaining. Unfortunately, it is entertaining in the way that accidentally hitting your thumb with a hammer is entertaining. go this route and fails hard!

Sometimes it is awesome, sometimes it is boring and tedious.Story: 5The show has a good premise and some pretty cool situations, but it is poorly executed, in my opinion. The fight scenes feel like something out of Naruto or DBZ: long and drawn out. The story could have been told much more quickly, and its a bit disappointing that such a cool premise wasn't taken advantage of as much as it could be. There could have been more games than just two per season, instead of having all the characters...standing in front of the enemy about to pull the trigger but chickening out most of the time.Either way it was pretty good until the infamous last episode... which was filled with boring and stupid dialogue and not the kind of action you would hope to have in the final episode... and then a completely meaningless ending.Art: 7The art was pretty good, and the 3D effect was unique and interesting despite the few times in which it looks ugly, as if it was rendered in 3D and the characters are just flat plains facing the camera (which it probably was). But I think they did a good job on the animation besides those parts.Sound: 6The sound was good especially the completely freaky monster voices. Besides that it wasn't too memorable except that it fit well. The music is sometimes ugly and sounds like it was a MIDI file.The music at the beginning is cool, though.Character: 6Besides the three main characters, the rest were completely flat. They were more charactures instead of characters, although that seemed to be the point. Gantz did a great job making completely unsympathetic and people (except for a few) to populate the anime besides the three main characters, showing how evil the human race is. In this part, the show excels, since these were never meant to be developed at all and instead just meant to show how awful some people can be.The problem with the show's characters are the main ones. Although Kei was a pretty complex character that you can both love and hate and laugh at at the same time, the other two were just annoying. Kei was a fun character, though. At first he is not very easy to like but by the end he is likable and cool. His extreme perversion was funny and lit up an otherwise bleak and brutal anime.Enjoyment: 4This is the part that annoys me. It could have been really enjoyable with all the cool fight scenes but it just ended up being tedious and painful. In some parts, it was meant to be that way, like the episodes in-between the games, and it was ok because they are meant to show humandkind's evil, but the fight scenes shouldn't have also been painful. I don't like listing to lengthy discussions in the middle of a battle when everything has paused just to hear them speak predictable and repetitive things, or see flashbacks over and over. I also found myself screaming at them to just shoot already. If you want something more enjoyable, read the manga.Overall: 5Gantz is an anime that is genius in some places and just plain stupid in others, plus its just too drawn out. I would only suggest this to fans of the manga or for someone with extreme patience or someone who is planning to do something while watching it. Near the end of the anime I was browsing the web and stuff while watching it because it was just too boring.I wouldn't suggest it to those who are looking just for gore and violence either because the rest of the show is just too tedious if thats all you are looking for.I don't regret watching it, though, it just could have been done much better. standing in front of the enemy about to pull the trigger but chickening out most of the time.Either way it was pretty good until the infamous last episode... which was filled with boring and stupid dialogue and not the kind of action you would hope to have in the final episode... and then a completely meaningless ending.Art: 7The art was pretty good, and the 3D effect was unique and interesting despite the few times in which it looks ugly, as if it was rendered in 3D and the characters are just flat plains facing the camera (which it probably was).

This is pretty much the second season of GANTZ, picking up were the last one left off. No story changes. The story to me is rather original, and you probably won't find many other stories like this one. The only problem I have with the story is how slow it moves. In total, GANTZ SECOND STAGE is 13 episodes long, but the story moves along at a pace more suiting to a 43 episode long anime. Very messed up pacing, and it uses...flashbacks more than it did in the last season here, which gets annoying.Art:Not much to say here, your typical 00's era art is here, but with terrible CGI mixed in. Most people wouldn't mind some CGI, but the CGI they used in here literally looks like a Playstation Game from the 90's. Bad Quality CGI, and the regular art doesn't have much to say for itself, although I will say that some parts of it are very detailed.Sound:Watch this series subbed, and the subtitles are very good. The Japanese voice actors are very suiting for each character that they portray. The only bad point is that the dub isn't as good as it should be. The monster's noises are very convincing and creepy, and if you watch this at night, be prepared to be creeped out.Characters:The main character is a hit or miss kind of guy. Some times you will like him, sometimes you won't. Characters in this series die and appear rather rapidly and realistically, so don't expect any cop outs from the producers where a character is 'magically' saved at their 11th hour. Most of the characters I enjoyed, but don't get to attached to them -- They don't hang around for very long.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this series very much despite some of it's flaws. The series ended when it started getting boring, which is always a good thing. If you have the time, I suggest watching all of GANTZ SECOND STAGE in one sitting. Very enjoyable.Overall:A good series that has it's flaws, but is brought back up by excellent action, a good plot premise, and lot's of blood. I would say that most people as long as they aren't offended by sex, nudity, blood, or exessive violence would massively enjoy this series as much as I did. I would say this series would be alright for a mature 13 year old or older to watch.

Main Verdict: Go buy this series."", 'What can be said about Gantz season two that hasn\'t been said about season one? Sex. Gantz really ups the ante in this season by starting out with a bang, or two. *hits snare*Seriously though, one of Gantz strengths, and probably the majority of its appeal, is that despite its flaws it is still pretty creative. Maybe not in overall plot, but the type of enemies they fight, the weapons they have, their suit\'s abilities, and the way people die. The range of aliens they encounter are pretty out there and bizarre, and I suppose that\'s fitting. They have an... interesting assortment of future technology...that makes for, let\'s just say, different fights. The ways in which people die are pretty crazy and... unexpected to say the least.Even though people are constantly getting screwed left and right, and the world is devious and merciless, something keeps drawing you in. There\'s some kind of perverse entertainment in Gantz sadistic nature. No matter how much he toys with people or what cruel conditions he inflicts on them, it\'s hard to hate the big black sphere. He always has humorous descriptions and nicknames for people, and he always starts off every deadly mission with a cheerful tune and this message:""Your lives are now over, you bastards.What you do with your new lives is for me to decide.So there you have it.""Along with increasing the sexuality and possibly gore, the second season of Gantz actually does a good job of resolving dubious elements of the previous season. Absurd mysteries like guns with two triggers and delayed shots are given some kind of explanation. Characters even out more and the storyline comes to a head and wraps everything up neatly. There\'s even a good twist towards the end. I also realized that I really like the ""next episode"" theme and wished it was used in the actual episodes. These things might not be canon, but as a way of capping a series they were just what the show needed.Of course this season is not without its weaknesses. The dub is still terrible, the dialogue is still belabored and the legendary glacial pacing of the first season is back with even more fervor than ever. The characters are as stale as they were before. The animation still oscillates between good and cheap with plenty of CG inbetween.Unfortunately this season is still riddled with needless flashbacks and ridiculous bodily blood fountains. And soooooo much ""speeching"". You get only ONE alien encounter, and the moment ANYTHING happens, it can always be followed up by: ""let\'s talk about it.""""Oh no! Kei is in danger. What should we do?""...Let\'s talk about it.""OMG! Is that an alien?""...Let\'s talk about it.""Hey... guys... I\'m dying.""Let\'s talk about it.This garrulous orgy is complimented by the shows love of still shots and still standing. You are treated to such action packed scenes as:* Kei standing still and screaming while slowly shooting a statue, who is also standing still and screaming* A statue slowly walking towards someone* A statue waiting his turn to slowly walk towards someoneThis actually ceases to be a problem towards the last few episodes where the final arc plays out. This was probably the best part of the season/series. Kei even redeems himself a little by the end of it...And then everything gets thrown out the window. The last few episodes of Gantz are some of the greatest offenders of the flaws I mention above. They even throw in a debate about moral relativism and modern warfare while they\'re fighting.  By this point the show gets ridiculous and it\'s obvious where it\'s going. The nosedive into inane territory is tremendous and the end couldn\'t come soon enough.I\'m not sure how to feel about Gantz because there are things about it I like, but so many things I don\'t... I don\'t necessarily regret watching Gantz, but I can think of many far better and less painful shows to recommend.

See this only if you have a real fetish for sadism and ecchi gore, otherwise you are probably better off just reading the manga.', 'Not long ago I reviewed the first stage of Gantz. I was far less than impressed with its mostly dull/moronic cast and its story that had more holes than your average slice of Swiss cheese. That being said, it was far from one of the worst anime I\'ve ever seen. Naturally, this means that people want me to look at the second stage claiming that ""it\'s better."" Being a cynic, I doubt it, but let\'s get our red pens ready and take a look at Gantz: Second Stage to see whether or not it actually is better.Okay, now that I\'ve finished, let\'s compare. The second...stage has the same setup as the first. A giant magic eight ball copies people at the instant of their deaths and sends those people to fight aliens for no adequately explained reason and he picks those people carefully so that they won\'t be smart enough to ask questions. The second stage does do a few things differently. The first is that they eliminate virtually all of the moments intended to build character in favour of mindless violence and sex. Honestly, the first stage was better. The character moments may not have contributed much since the execution was pants and most characters were just introduced for the sake of acting as fodder, but at least it tried to have development. This one does give some motivation to Gantz, but it\'s really really lazy. Basically, they imply that Gantz is doing it for laughs. Is it better than no explanation? Not really, Gantz is still like a silver-age comic villain. Evil for the sake of being evil. At least no explanation had the potential for something interesting. One thing that is better is that they actually do have some genuinely evil threats in this one, at the very end, anyway. This one also doesn\'t suffer from continuity errors... Well, not in the plot anyway. They also get rid of the horrible working girl joke. Unfortunately, they replace it with several horrible gay jokes, all in the span of a few episodes. Yeah, that\'s not a real improvement. It\'s just trading some of the misogyny for more homophobia. They eventually do start questioning Gantz, which really needed to happen earlier, they do it in the last few episodes so it\'s really too little too late. There is one other issue with Second Stage, and that\'s the ending. It\'s a complete anti-climax.The characters were pretty bad in the first stage. So, surely they improved them here, right? Wrong. They\'re actually worse. None of the major characters from the first stage develop any further. Male Kei is still an insufferable prick Female Kei doesn\'t get any more good scenes and goes back to being quietly supportive. Kato remains the only decent character, but doesn\'t get any further development. The rest of the cast is still very much composed of bland, one-dimensional figures. So, how is it worse? Here\'s the basic thing. The first one didn\'t have deep characters, but at least they were consistent. In this one they take the guy with the semi-important speech about the sanctity of life, and the first thing he does is murder someone in cold blood. Great continuity.The art is about the same. It\'s pretty strong with strange looking eyes and really bad gore effects. Actually, these gore effects just get silly. There\'s a guy who gets punched and his head stretches like a rock em sock em robot. There\'s another scene where a guy gets flattened and you just expect one of those cartoony ""splat"" sound effects. There are several death scenes that should be intense, but the ridiculousness of the gore just ruins it. There isn\'t as much fan-service, but there\'s still quite a bit. The fight scenes are about the same. They\'re pretty interesting and unique. They actually might be a little better since there are fewer characters who stand around and watch.The voice acting and music are the strongest points, just like the first stage. The actors do really well and the music is nice and atmospheric.The yuri factor is a 1/10. Again, there\'s not much interaction among the female characters.So, is it an improvement? In a few ways, yeah. There\'s less fan-service and the fight scenes are a little better. Overall, it\'s not as good, though. Yeah, the first one was sloppy, but at least it tried to have some depth. This one just says ""screw it"" and takes the mindless sex and action route and its flaws are just all the more obvious because of it. The Second Stage gets a 3/10.  My one consolation is that there isn\'t any more to the anime. I can only imagine what they would do with a third season. stage has the same setup as the first. A giant magic eight ball copies people at the instant of their deaths and sends those people to fight aliens for no adequately explained reason and he picks those people carefully so that they won\'t be smart enough to ask questions. The second stage does do a few things differently. The first is that they eliminate virtually all of the moments intended to build character in favour of mindless violence and sex. Honestly, the first stage was better. The character moments may not have contributed much since the execution was pants and most characters were just introduced for the sake of acting as fodder, but at least it tried to have development. This one does give some motivation to Gantz, but it\'s really really lazy. Basically, they imply that Gantz is doing it for laughs. Is it better than no explanation? Not really, Gantz is still like a silver-age comic villain. Evil for the sake of being evil. At least no explanation had the potential for something interesting. One thing that is better is that they actually do have some genuinely evil threats in this one, at the very end, anyway. This one also doesn\'t suffer from continuity errors... Well, not in the plot anyway. They also get rid of the horrible working girl joke. Unfortunately, they replace it with several horrible gay jokes, all in the span of a few episodes. Yeah, that\'s not a real improvement. It\'s just trading some of the misogyny for more homophobia. They eventually do start questioning Gantz, which really needed to happen earlier, they do it in the last few episodes so it\'s really too little too late. There is one other issue with Second Stage, and that\'s the ending. It\'s a complete anti-climax.The characters were pretty bad in the first stage. So, surely they improved them here, right? Wrong. They\'re actually worse. None of the major characters from the first stage develop any further. Male Kei is still an insufferable prick Female Kei doesn\'t get any more good scenes and goes back to being quietly supportive. Kato remains the only decent character, but doesn\'t get any further development. The rest of the cast is still very much composed of bland, one-dimensional figures. So, how is it worse? Here\'s the basic thing. The first one didn\'t have deep characters, but at least they were consistent. In this one they take the guy with the semi-important speech about the sanctity of life, and the first thing he does is murder someone in cold blood. Great continuity.The art is about the same. It\'s pretty strong with strange looking eyes and really bad gore effects. Actually, these gore effects just get silly. There\'s a guy who gets punched and his head stretches like a rock em sock em robot. There\'s another scene where a guy gets flattened and you just expect one of those cartoony ""splat"" sound effects. There are several death scenes that should be intense, but the ridiculousness of the gore just ruins it. There isn\'t as much fan-service, but there\'s still quite a bit. The fight scenes are about the same. They\'re pretty interesting and unique. They actually might be a little better since there are fewer characters who stand around and watch.The voice acting and music are the strongest points, just like the first stage.

WHY ARE YOU READING ABOUT THE SECOND PART OF THIS???Gantz second stage follows our hero whatever his name is as he continues to talk about the last five seconds he has to live while facing down aliens for half of an episode before managing to kill them.He has people that follow him that sometimes have interesting arcs or personalities, but you shouldn\'t even try to remember their names because they won\'t pan out to anything.Imagine if you would, being smacked repeatedly in the  face and told how awful the world is and how you have no hope or accomplishing anything....Then imagine being given a short sort of reprieve while only being roughly patted. In comparison, it\'s not so bad, but not enjoyable either.Rarely have I ever told myself ""This is so un-enjoyable that I MUST finish watching it so that I can be sure it never gets better"" It never got better. In fact, it only got worse from the first season.A cursory glance around this site will reveal how long and detailed a story that the manga of Gantz has. It likely has pacing that fits it\'s span of a story, and may handle the material better and in a more engaging fashion.This anime does none of those things, compared to any material.The ending is like your nameless torturer, tired of slapping and patting you, finally just bashing your head in with a bat; a sweet release from endless misery.

I'd seen gore, but not really in this much of a gruesome, war-like setting.Don't get me wrong I love me some gore, but over the season I still want meaningful story.

It's really hard to enjoy and connect with characters when they're in a constant state of...recycling.And the ending?

Basically its about a mysterious black ball in a random appartment building. At the moment of certain peoples deaths, they are instead instantly transported to this appartment where they are made to stand around for a little while, conversing...with each other and trying to figure out what the hell is happening. The ball then begins to play excercise music and displays text on its screen telling these people that they are dead and their lives now are up to Gantz (the name of the ball) to decide.It opens up and give people the option to grab any weapons (which are guns with a time lag that make things explode...yeah really you kinda have to see it yourself) and a suit that give you the ability of super strength agility and what-not. It then teleports them to random parts of tokyo on missions to kill Aliens for points, once you reach 100 points you are set free. If you die while in the game, you die forever, if you live then you can go back to your ordinary lives until Gantz teleports you back to the room for another mission.This is really the entire plot of the series and it is for sure a love or hate type of anime. If your expecting an extremely deep and compelling plot that will make you think this is not it, there is no real mystery to solve and there are no real hints as to whats goign on, this is pure adrenaline pumping entertainment. Unfortunately it end with a filler arc which sucks if you have read the actually manga and wanted more awesomeness but in an ongoing manga serise, such is expected. Other filler though was completely not needed, such as with Nishi\'s death and the events leading up to it, i swear it took about 2 episodes while it took only a few pages in the book, it was absolutely ridiculous but you just have to grin and bear it.Art: There isnt alot to say about the art, it looks good for when it was made with both hand drawn art and CG animation for different segments and it doesn\'t look THAT awkward. If anything it adds to the zanyness of the serise. It is clear at segments where corners were cut but this can be found in many anime. There are some segments where i litarally rolled my eyes at the recycled animation though which was kind of a downer.Sound: The sound fit the series just fine, nothing that stood out as bad really, the theme song alone was awesome and i hardly ever skipped it, another time where i recalled the music being quite good was when the green onion alien was being killed. It was very dark and grungy yet new sounding and ""hip"" it was very interesting and fit the situation perfectly.Character: I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, you will be hard pressed not to find a little bit of yourself in at least a few of them and they all have interesting personalities. Its also very nice to see that they react to these bizzare and crazy situations in very realistic ways, such as wanting to run away from the aliens most of the time or just walk away from the mission thinking its stupid. Without giving too much away there is developement ( at least from the main character Kei) while the rest tend to stick to their morals and ideals. Its also nice to see that the author really doesn\'t care who lives and who dies. This is quite refreshing seeing as how in most stories you can tell whos major and whos going to make it quite far but with Gantz you never know. Also with each mission there are many deaths, which means Gantz has to bring in many interesting characters each new mission.Enjoyment: The pure crazyness of the plot and the way characters act is the best part of this series. Some of the lines said (especially in the dub) just make you laugh out loud at how ridiculous they are. Its got gore, comedy, hot chicks, crazy aliens and powers....all i can say is its highly enjoyable (just make sure you don\'t read into it too much).Overall i\'d have to give this series a 7 and thats coming from a huge Gantz fan, the filler and pacing is simply bad at times and if you have read the original material you will be rolling your eyes at some changes and the ending. If you enjoy this series i HIGHLY reccomend you check out the manga, it is way, way better. with each other and trying to figure out what the hell is happening.

The concept is still the same, but here we finally get to the whole picture of what Gantz is all about. The ""monsters"" or whatever they are... are surely more interesting, though still as weird... and there is a really clever twist in the final episodes, which was what did this show justice for me. Much more action is present in this second stage which was absent from the first...season.Art: 7The art is pretty good and has some unique elements. I wasn\'t wowed, but the characters were drawn well and overall it fitted the whole concept of the show. I really liked the use of colors like gold.Sound: 7The sound was what I enjoyed the most in the series. I find it extremely fitting for the atmosphere of this anime, with a cool, groovy and quite memorable opening theme.Characters: 6In this season the main characters become far more interesting and there is growth as the story unfolds, which the first season lacked. The supportive characters in this season are more interesting than the first ones, and also play a much more drastic and important part in the main plot.Enjoyment: 7I am not a big fan of gore for the sake of gore. Bust still I found this anime worth watching. It had something completely new to bring to the table and the second season surely made me change my view of it. Especially the ending justified the whole thing for me.Overall: 6Violence and sex stuff it\'s what this anime aims for to make a difference.In my opinion they are used just to be used... fanservice? maybe. But for me they are not what made it stand out...I enjoyed it for these few moments when it puts you to some thinking, although it\'s only elemental... but still it offers some food for the mind, which is not completely trash. You can also say I might enjoyed some of its weirdness at parts...If you watched the first season and didn\'t like it I think that this one might feel a little better to you. I would recommend it just because it\'s different in style and it has a few things to offer. It will test your nerves and stomachs sometimes to extreme levels, but if you can bare with that it can offer a few good thoughts too. season.Art: 7The art is pretty good and has some unique elements.

What is Gantz?2. Why are they fighting aliens?3. Why can't anyone see the aliens?3. Why were the specific people chosen?4. What's up with the old lady?5. Who started Gantz?6. Why must they kill aliens?...7. why are they chosen before they die?This season is overall much better than the last, characters actually have some depth to them, and are actually in danger when they're in a mission. With the increase in character development the action increased too, for the most part characters are actually fighting the aliens instead of talking about killing them. That is until the final episode where the show gets too dang preachy and starts trying to bring on topics that can't really be taken seriously when there's giant breasted girls being shown every few episodes. Overall this season improved a lot from the last one, but the show does hit a bump in the last episode where it gets too preachy and leaves the fans with a bunch of answered questions and a bit a of bitter sweet taste in their mouth. If you were having trouble getting invested in to the show, but for some reason you were still interested in Gantz you should defiantly check out this season. 7. why are they chosen before they die?This season is overall much better than the last, characters actually have some depth to them, and are actually in danger when they're in a mission.

As usual, there's the typical conflict of interests and wide spread confusion about what's actually going on, creating a bit of hilarious dialogue between the characters and a few horrible jokes from the big man himself.Things become a little more bad ass through parts of this series, where we have feature length sex scenes to highly improved action scenes where we can actually see the protagonist kicking it to all of these weird and strange aliens but sadly, it's a shame to see him become just like them as he continues fighting for his life. I did become a little more attached to him as time went on.I would say that the first three quarters of the plot are well constructed and enjoyable to watch, but the final arc of this series drifted away from the manga and is animé original material. Now usually, this isn't always a bad thing for a short series like Gantz but the last few episodes are terrible to say the least, in my opinion. They take away everything you've enjoyed about the series, alter the principles entirely, throw in barely humorous characters with meaningless existences and then rip off one of the endings to one of the best animé in existence. It's so far up there, I don't think it's coming back down anytime soon, and not where the sun shines.I think the art is fine, the visual construct of the aliens are all interesting and dynamic as per usual; sometimes a lot more than what you would expect. Whoever produced the art for this series really knows how to handle their gore effects. If there's one thing I dislike, it's essentially how ugly the characters are. Now that usually wouldn't be a problem for me in a series like Gantz but when you look at the manga, they're significantly better drawn to the extent they almost look like twisted abominations in the animé or badly made clones.As for the sound, most of the audio comes through internal monologue, with significantly less time for the characters actually speaking. I listened to both the Japanese track and the dubbed sound-track. I think they're both alright but neither of them or perfect, someone will like them. I would avoid the dub altogether though, the voice acting is horrendous for this show. The Japanese sound-track definitely had a 'proper' feel when it came to confronting the horrific situations, but I didn't feel as strongly about the action packed scenes.Our characters haven't really changed all that much. Our protagonist picks up some bad-ass in this series and kicks the action scenes into overdrive, but he's still got a long way to go before he can develop a better personality. Our other characters aren't that interesting, but the new additions can be quite hilarious at times, mainly when they're moaning or being slaughtered. In-short, there's really not much difference between this series and the first.It's enjoyable but it could be a lot better. If they had stuck to the manga, the series would have been much better. If they had just left it open for a continuation or a movie, I think this series would have gotten much better responses from the fanbase. I don't think all animé original material is terrible, but the ending for this show really is just up it's own posterior and it leaves an awful aftertaste behind.But yeah. Gantz is a good series for a mature audience that enjoys action packed scenes, blood and boobies. Toss in some serious humor and we've got ourselves a pretty nice show. I recommend the manga strongly to people who enjoyed this. series introduces an entirely new host of characters, that are all different from the last bunch invited to take part in the twisted game.

I don't think all animé original material is terrible, but the ending for this show really is just up it's own posterior and it leaves an awful aftertaste behind.But yeah. Gantz is a good series for a mature audience that enjoys action packed scenes, blood and boobies. Toss in some serious humor and we've got ourselves a pretty nice show. I recommend the manga strongly to people who enjoyed this."", 'Story:Talk about a huge disappointment.I try not to mention source material a lot when discussing a work, but I think it\'s very important to mention it here in this review. This anime does not follow the manga to an unbelievable degree. That\'d be alright if it wasn\'t NECESSARY to create an enjoyable experience. For instance, the manga has a turning point, an event that makes the series much better, as the lead character, Kei, undergoes dynamic \'cold-turkey\' in a sense. His character is hit with a brick and he realizes what\'s happened in his life so far, then turns around. To those who have read...the manga, you know what I\'m talking about. However, despite this event leading into the what makes the manga so great, this anime, immediately after this event, begins to follow its own canon.This isn\'t what makes the anime bad, however. I have no issue with an anime going off the source material. I can easily regard it as an alternate telling, or even it\'s own work. However, the new direction completely mitigates everything one has come to understand within the world of Gantz, be it the characters, the believable harsh reality of life countered by death, and the general laws dictated by how the ""game"" works. Everything is thrown out the window, and everything you committed to (and yes, both the anime AND the early sections of the anime are an arduous commitment) is for naught, as writers create one of the worst, most offensive sub-plots that culminate into a terrible mess of mindless violence and pretentious rubbish.A friend and I had been going through the entire Gantz anime in less than a week only to find it end on one of the absolute worst notes. We were appalled, stricken by the lackluster pacing, terrible characterization, and downright ridiculous in world antics that followed the latter half of the anime. And, honestly, while the first half still suffers from crap pacing, it\'s the sins of the latter half that bog down virtually every aspect of this anime. I don\'t understand why anyone would alter what is, quite literally, the beginning of the greater section of the Gantz manga considering how difficult the first few sections are to get through. It completely boggles my mind.Gantz has a constant theme of despair that is countered by Kei\'s undying will to survive. It\'s Sisyphus all over the place. However, just because the world is hopeless and cruel, it doesn\'t mean I have to be shown some of the vilest, inhumane things I\'ve ever seen in any media form. Now, some may call me out for being weak or childish, but I\'ll have you know I\'ve watched my fair share of horror films and enjoy the thrill of horror and despair, but it\'s in the idea that one can survive or find hope that they end up finding such things enjoyable (at least, in a moral sense). So, despite Kei being Sisyphus, there isn\'t anything heroic about his venture. Rather, his character was completely unlikable for the longest time and then is thrust into the position to carry a narrative in a different direction. One with hope. Is that possible? No. Why? Because he signified everything wrong to begin with. So, when he becomes the hero, and his portrayal of him as a hero is so unbelievably half-assed, it becomes pathetic and offensive. I can\'t even praise this work for being self-aware since it\'s clear anyone working on it had no idea what they were doing.Art:The animation, while alright in some areas, fails to deliver anything particularly amazing. Anime has the potential to bring to life the page, but the animation was lifeless in comparison. It succeeds in some regard, but due to how boring action scenes are, and how unbelievable other things come across, I don\'t even know if I\'d consider it all that good. I think it meets right at the center since it properly succeeds in painting a terrible, awful, pitiful picture.Sound:The music is forgettable, and the sound effects were alright. I didn\'t find anything all that moving, nor did I find anything all that intense. A lot of this is due to the failure of the animation, as Sound really hinges on proper pacing. That said, the music does it\'s job to an extent, and to that, I must say it\'s sufficient.Character:Throw everything you know out the window. Kei\'s character transforms with no explanation, growth, or anything halfway into the narrative. One might argue that there\'s a reason for his actions in the second-half, but then I\'d question whether they read the manga or not. The reason that\'s so important is because the manga paced his transformation with such incredible care. So, why the change? Was there something wrong with the source material? If there was, and that\'s why this story was changed so greatly for the second half, then at least do everyone the kindness of telling a GOOD story in your characters!I can\'t fault the first half entirely on the sins of the second in this regard, since things are going well until the halfway point. However, it\'s still really bad.Enjoyment:WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!! My friend and I were completely disgusted by this work. A complete load of crud. Avoid this like the plague. Read the manga, watch the first season, eagerly await the new film, catch up on the spin-off. Do everything EXCEPT watch this complete filth.

Swapping from being scared in the beginning, which is completely understandable, then being strong, but then they would bounce back to being scared and strong and it just repeated. That left me being kind of unimpressed with the first 'season'. But, having watched this, it doesn't get rid of how they were in the first half, but this half is...much better.Kei is fighting for his life and so are his new friends and acquaintances.Some of the things in this are a lot more intense, especially the Buddha Temple mission. That on it's own was better than the first half entirely. That's what makes me regret not reviewing it as a whole and doing it as the seasonal parts it's split into. It really needs to be considered a whole, as that's what it is. Between the two there is no break.If you decide to watch Gantz, make sure to take that into account.This half doesn't hold back on the blood and gore, surprisingly there's probably more than before. The characters develop to a place where they're enjoyable and the good points of the first half carry over, like the intensity of everything, how rough and raw it is, the blood and guts.The plot for the entire series is entertaining, different and a great idea.It's dark and when it gets into it, can have you sitting there in anticipation wondering what could happen next.It is a good series, it has it's flaws that stop it from being as great as it could be.

One moment, a homeless man/""hobo"" falls down to the tracks and no one (but Katou) attempts to save him. After noticing his old friend, Katou asked Kei for his help (despite not wanting to give him a hand). While the hobo did get rescued, both Katou and Kai were killed by the subway train. However, instead of really being ""dead"", they were ""saved"" by Gantz (I guess...you could say he is a humanoid machine).while I\'m not a huge fan of it, it is a great startoff. I do love the interactions between characters fighting out for either survival or enjoyment. While there are plenty of moments that made me cringe real badly, it is something I can live with. Regardless, everything about it is really done well except the ending. The ending was the only disappointment I had, because... well, it does not answer anything at all. Allow me to say this: What\'s the point of playing a game if your fate is already sealed?The fighting scenes are really great. I can say it\'s one of the more enjoyable moments of Gantz and worth the watch.Characters can be iffy, but let\'s just say most of them are not relevant. ;DOverall, I would give this a 6/10.

It just seems extremely rushed and I am fully aware that the reason for that is because the series wasn't renewed for a third season so they had to make something up so as to give the viewers an ending.

That\'s not to say it\'s good, mind you. I came away from [i]Gantz[/i] with mixed feelings that ultimately ended in dislike. The show follows a perverted, angry-at-the-world teenager who sees an old friend at a train station. They both witness a homeless man fall onto the tracks, and the friend jumps onto the tracks to save him, then yelling for his friend to help. For no good reason that I can figure out (unless it\'s peer-pressure), the cynic jumps onto the track to help. They save the old man, but are killed by...a train, and transported to an apartment, where others who have just died seem to be gathered.I don\'t want to say more about the plot, but I do like the ideas behind it. The story told in [i]Gantz[/i] is interesting enough that it kept me watching it all the way through. I wanted to know what was going to happen next, especially in the latter four episodes or so. However, the ending left me very unsatisfied, and made no sense at all. I came away from the story ultimately with a sense of pointlessness.Of course, it doesn\'t help the show\'s case that the main character is utterly unlikeable, for me at least. He almost comes off as believable, but is taken too far to really be a believable character.The same rings true for most of the characters. They\'re presented as these people in this alternate Earth, but then taken just a little too far in their archetypes to be believable. This isn\'t necessarily a problem for most of the characters, except the one or two that just become annoying.This problem is compounded by the art design for [i]Gantz[/i]. Everything is drawn quasi-realistically, but retains enough of the fact that it\'s an anime that, again, it just becomes a little annoying, rather than giving the impression that I\'m sure the people behind this show wanted it to.Voice acting for the series is, overall, decent.

The VA work wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t great, either.My biggest problem with the show has to be the pacing. For the first few episodes, things go along somewhat slowly, but any time it comes to a scene where the characters disagree about something, they stand around for twenty minutes talking in circles about it. Everything seems like it\'s taking way too long, to the point where it became a game to guess what would happen episodes in advance, which isn\'t a fun game, because the answer is always, ""They\'re gonna talk about it for two episodes, and then they\'ll actually do [spoiler].""But not only does it move really slowly, but any time stuff does start to happen, the viewer is constantly assaulted by the gory deaths of characters that I guess we\'re supposed to care about, but I didn\'t, and by scenes that almost make this show hentai, if not for the rest of the plot.That\'s pretty much [i]Gantz[/i] in a nutshell; nothing happens, then gore, then sexual scene, then nothing for a while, then a lot of talking in circles, more gore, and more nothing. I wouldn\'t recommend this show to anyone. [i]Gantz[/i] is not worth spending the ten or so hours to watch the entire series.

The show kills of its characters without much thought and often the characters die in ridiculous ways that could be easily preventable if not for some weird reverse-plot armor the show gives its characters. Maybe because of this, I never particularly cared when a character died.What I found interesting about the show, however, and what kept me going, were the moments when they weren't fighting the aliens where a...whole multitude of depravities in characters showed - Religious fervor, adultery, lying, cowardice, allowing the savior of your kids life to die simply because you don't want to get involved, running over someone while carelessly talking on the phone and then driving off, hypocrisy and constant justifications, rape, suicide, child abuse, and more. Gantz goes through the whole gamut of human depravities and, though none of the topics in particular go particulary in-depth, they serve in creating an interesting world filled with these disgusting people which kept me interested enough to finish and enjoy, to some extent, the two seasons of Gantz. whole multitude of depravities in characters showed - Religious fervor, adultery, lying, cowardice, allowing the savior of your kids life to die simply because you don't want to get involved, running over someone while carelessly talking on the phone and then driving off, hypocrisy and constant justifications, rape, suicide, child abuse, and more.

half didn't really help to improve the way I thought about this anime, it was still stupidly entertaining.The second half continues with Kei Kurono and the others trying to desperately survive Gantz's cruel game however they don't realise that the game is only gonna get worse.The second half immediately begins where the first half closed off and I think there was a little improvement when it came to the story a little bit because there are a few twists that did catch me off guard and it tries...to make the characters more likeable, but most stay pretty much the same, it also tries to show how messed human beings can be as not everyone who dies and gets teleported to Gantz is a friendly person and we really see how far some people are willing to go just to survive another day.The show still decides to have it's characters make stupid and ridiculous decisions which seems even more so this time around as the way some people died was inexplicably dumb and just seemed a really bad way to kill a character.The ending was pretty lackluster too and was pretty confusing too, it felt like it was trying to do a Cowboy Bebop, but failed immensely.The characters did improve in some ways and even some of the supporting characters that managed to survive the first half weren't that bad either.Kei Kurono actually makes some progress in his character this season as he becomes a legitimate badass when fighting the monsters, but he also starts to care about the people he is fighting with at some point and realise's that fighting together is the best way of survival.Katou makes some improvement well by the end he does as throughout most of the season he still acts like a pacifist and when he does start fighting the monsters he gets killed off which really pissed me off because he had just started acting like a badass.Kishimoto pretty much stays the same fanservice girl that she is, but she does fight against the monsters better in this half than she did in the first half, but her view on Kurono and Katou kinda annoyed me and just seemed like the only thing her character was there for which was a really stupid love triangle of sorts.Some of the supporting characters like Sadayo, Mika, Sei, Masanobou and even Giichi were pretty solid characters and seeing these characters die sucked a little because they did have some potential, however the one character that really pissed me off was Hajime who was one bastard that I really wanted to see die and he was one messed up person, his pretend child voice also made me want to strangle him.The artstyle kinda went to new heights this second half because the monsters would grow to ridiculous proportions and looked like they were impossible to kill, even some monsters looked OP as hell to kill because there was one monster that had a huge array of attacks like a laser, liquid acid and it also had regenerative powers too which certainly made for one tough monster.The action was definitely better this second half and even though the characters were still stupid the battles just wiped that stupidity away because seeing a group of people fighting giant monsters is definitely fun entertainment, we even get to see the players fight each other towards the end making for some hectic psychological moments since the criminals that were part of a new group desperately tried to persuade the others to kill Kei because Gantz demanded it.There was definitely an increase in the gore too because some people died in a pretty nasty way especially when their bodies are severed in half by acid, cut to pieces by lasers or just squashed and pummelled to death which doesn't seem like a cool way to go out.The fanservice increased too as more female characters were introduced that all seemed to have surprisingly good looking bodies and again surprisingly there was a few sex scenes which is something I've seen rarely in anime especially when you actually see the full naked body and not just some noises behind a wall.Overall the second half is just a little better than the first half, but not by much I think Gantz is a stupidly enjoyable anime, hopefully someone can make something like this in the future and hopefully not have stupid characters then it would actually be a thrilling anime to watch. to make the characters more likeable, but most stay pretty much the same, it also tries to show how messed

Like Marmite, people either vigorously enjoy the show for its chaotic action and the thrilling pace, or religiously condemn it for its perpetual plot holes and shallow nature.Gantz follows the story of Kei Kurono: a selfish, cocky, and rather porn-obsessed adolescent, and the trials and tribulations he faces in fighting the plethora of aliens that Gantz conjures. At first, this sounds promising. However, it is not until the second half of the 2nd season that the show becomes monotonous: fight alien(s). survive, repeat. fight alien(s), survive, repeat. fight alien(s), survive, repeat....So the repetitive nature of the show becomes too dull and slightly boring to watch.Until you realise that one of the best things about this anime is the character development in Kei. Don't get me wrong: the change in person does not occur until fairly late. But it feels right and most appropriate for Kei to have evolved under such pernicious circumstances.Furthermore, to put it frankly, the CGI and overall animation are terrible; at times it felt like you were watching a 2D school-project movie made by an 11-year-old. There are frequent (and repetitive) moments when one character runs and the screen moves but the character almost seemingly stays in the same position, albeit with their legs moving. You'll see what I mean if you were to watch it.

GANTZ has one of the worst adaptations I have ever had the displeasure of watching. It only covers the first 3-4? volumes of a 37 volume manga and then makes up a story to end it which is actually worse than the manga. It's bad. "", 'I started by reading the manga about a year ago and have followed it since.  However the anime was not nearly as good as the manga.  Season 1 was okay because everyone was stupid noobs.  The second season was a letdown.  Kurono was a winy bitch too obsessed with morals which ruin the last 3 episodes.  The manga allows the characters to get stronger while the anime keeps the characters weak and timid.  The only redeeming aspect of the end is that it could allow for additional seasons to follow up and continue the series.  8/10 :( disappointing. ', 'I Hate this show. Every time you think its going to be interesting or action packed it disappoints. The basic idea could have made it worth watching except for the constant whining. It makes it hard to care when none of the characters are worth following and the only time it seemed like the characters or plot were going to get interesting the show disappoints again and ops to follow the least interesting of the characters. Despite the art I would recommend skipping this and watching anything else. ', 'Mild spoilers below, maybe?The stupidity haven\'t changed from the first season. I\'m sure (at least I\'m hoping) the manga and entire idea has a clear message in mind but the execution is just really terrible here.The pacing gets a bit faster and newly introduced characters get ready for battle earlier than before but in the end it doesn\'t really matter. Characters are still uni-dimensional and their relationships sucks for the most part. One woman asks the MC if he needs anything because she\'s here to help. He asks if he can fuck her. She gets angry... but then goes along with it and say something...like ""if you see me as a whore then I guess I am one"". But she ordered a book so that her entire character doesn\'t revolve about being Boobies #2. Another *deep* relationship gives another wonderful dialogue like ""I knew you got erections because of me and I got off thinking about your hard-on"". The scene is supposed to be sad, I think. The MC\'s development gets a bit interesting but to be honest with all the shit going around I don\'t care as long as this hellish anime ends.Some characters death could have been avoided but of course they need to because it\'s sad and dramatic but because it could have been avoided, it takes away the effect and is just really pathetic. A character runs toward another to tackle him away from harm? You wish! The character hugs the other in an attempt to protect them and dies. Why not a tackle?The gantz suits work weirdly as well, as if their defensive properties greatly varies depending on the needs of the plot. We need tension and suspense! Suit stops working... but the character mustn\'t die! Suit starts working again! Wait what?! Then you can get kicked and tossed around by a giant alien and be fine, but a few rounds of assault rifle is lethal? People get killed when there is only a few seconds left as well, because yes you guessed it, drama and suspense!Also you\'d think you\'d learn a few things regarding what is Gantz and who the man inside is, but nothing on that. I suppose they didn\'t reveal anything because it was in a later part in the manga, but the adaptation appears to make up its own ending, so it had no reason not to enlighten us a bit. Ending tries to be edgy and ambiguous too. No comment on that, I\'m just glad it finally ends. like ""if you see me as a whore then I guess I am one"".

The second Part was still better than the first one.Let me make one thing clear. I don\'t know the manga of this work, so I could only get an idea of \u200b\u200bthe anime. I have also heard that the anime is not following the manga.This should be said before I get to the actual evaluation of this ... ""work"".Let\'s get to the plot first. The basic idea of \u200b\u200bhunting for death, cloning and all the trimmings is quite interesting. Even towards the end of the series,...some tension was built up due to the fresher episodes.But apart from that, the whole story has received little information from anything. And the episodes were practically unsettling. Every now and then a character ran to one spot for almost 2 minutes. Or they just stared or screamed at each other for around 60 seconds just to get to the episode time. The series followed no logic. According to my previous assessment, I have never seen an anime in about 12 years in which the scenes rotated in a circle and were drawn in such a way. It\'s like chewing gum for weeks. There were actually some episodes that only presented one scene for 20 minutes. And in the context of this scene, everyone just stood around and stared at each other like confused bricks.Animations ... in 2004 you were used to better things, even years before. This is a mix of .. cheap CGI? And grotesquely bad animations. The characters run as if they were sliding. The jumps are almost amusing. And the whole area is full of CGI, even the garbage cans and the floor. But with the animations of the nude portrayals, they reached directly into the budget.Characters ...I have rarely seen such a collection of ... stupid, ignorant and hateful creatures. Only at the end did some intelligent characters finally appear and the protagonist also learned to use his brain cells. Previously, the average IQ was around 10.None of them were able to conduct even the simplest of dialogues, they couldn\'t even enlighten each other.  And that was just one of the examples. As if you had put a drunken intern on the typewriter.Apart from that, almost all of them have been incredibly unappealing. One was worse than the other. There were only a handful of average characters. Otherwise there was the protagonist ""kurono"". By far the biggest thorn in the whole anime. Selfish, greedy, envious, cowardly, haughty, weak, perverse, horny and constantly on the go with erection or sexual fantasies. And around 90% of the plant.And then the music ..Apart from terrible intro and outro, which I couldn\'t even attribute a point to. We have the soundtracks. There were a few ... at least average tones to be heard here. What\'s worst about it is the lack of professionalism. The soundtracks have always been louder than the actual dialogues. If I had no subtitles and would speak Japanese, I would have understood almost no word. The voices c.a. 30% and the music 70% completely dominated the scenes.In the end, the plot has potential and the last 4-5 episodes are better than the rest of the series. On the whole, ""Gantz"" is probably one of the poorest quality works of all time.

Secondly, I really hated the main character at first, but by the end my opinion changed and I found myself rooting for him.  Finally, I really enjoyed the way it finished.  It might have been nice to end it differently, but I felt it was rapped up nicely and left me satisfied.

It's fantastic seeing Kei Kurono's character develop from episode 1.  My jaw dropped in amazement in...these episodes.Yet sadly all good things have to come to an end. First theres this amazing Buddha episode, but then they toss in some make shift piece of crap they call the last episode. This episode was throughly awkward yet epic at times, I just feel like every fan ended up scratching there head at the end of this series.But I will still say this is one of my favourite animes and everyone should watch it. I recommend watching up to episode 21 and reading the manga which I have not done but plan to. I look forward to it, in replacement of this garbage ending. these episodes.Yet sadly all good things have to come to an end.

Kaze no Naka no Shoujo: Kinpatsu no Jeanie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3110/Kaze_no_Naka_no_Shoujo__Kinpatsu_no_Jeanie,"[""(Mostly Spoiler Free minus one thing that happens at the very beginning of the show.)Kaze no Naka no Shoujo Kinpatsu no Jeanie, or Girl in the Wind: Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair, in English, stars Jeanie MacDowell a young girl living happily with her parents and best friends Stephen and Bill in a small town in Pennsylvania around 1838. Considering the title it's kinda odd that she has very much so blond hair in the anime but that's a small nitpick I'll mention just for the fun of it.The show pretty much starts out like an Worldmasterpiece Theather show with a girl going through...her day-to-day life as her father the doctor from the town helps patients together with Jeanie's mother. Tragedy however strikes not too long after when Jeanie's mother dies which changes Jeanie's life forever and drives her to discover her dreams for the future and find her own path in life._________Characters_________The main three characters Jeanie, Stephen and Bill are overall strong written characters with their own will, hopes and dreams.Jeanie herself goes through quite a bit of character development throughout the series and never breaks away from her beliefs and certainly isn't afraid to open her mouth.Stephen however is a bit of a mixed bag as he tends to sometimes lean more towards his flaws than his stronger sides. Ultimately however he serves for a good love interest for Jeanie and isn't just a handsome boy for her to swoon over.Bill is the most impressive of all, considering the time this anime takes place it was very refreshing to see what they did with his character and his struggles were very believable._________The Good_________The anime has several strong parts throughout the 52 run episodes where it feels quite realistic and introduces problems for the characters to solve that give quite some character development.Also what I especially liked was how the show would introduce side characters in a way that made them seem like bad people but then would turn around and show in quite realistic ways that every person in the world has their own reasons for their behaviour and actions and that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone who seems to be a bad person is a bad person._________The Bad_________Sometime mid-way into the series an unexpected plot twist arises which honestly makes the series far worse than what it could've been. The series does however recover after awhile but then falls in the pitfall of repeating the same type of problem in a different fashion all the way up till the last few episodes making the ending feel less satisfying than it could've been._________Conclusion_________I enjoyed Jeanie for what it was, but I think that if I had known beforehand that the show's strength went down in the second half I would've enjoyed it more for the simple fact my expectations were higher after the first stronger half. If you're looking for an old-school anime with enjoyable characters and like anime such as the Worldmasterpiece theater ones then I whole heartedly recommend you give this one a try! her day-to-day life as her father the doctor from the town helps patients together with Jeanie's mother.

Ultimately however he serves for a good love interest for Jeanie and isn't just a handsome boy for her to swoon over.Bill is the most impressive of all, considering the time this anime takes place it was very refreshing to see what they did with his character and his struggles were very believable._________The Good_________The anime has several strong parts throughout the 52 run episodes where it feels quite realistic and introduces problems for the characters to solve that give quite some character development.Also what I especially liked was how the show would introduce side characters in a way that made them seem like bad people but then would turn around and show in quite realistic ways that every person in the world has their own reasons for their behaviour and actions and that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone who seems to be a bad person is a bad person._________The Bad_________Sometime mid-way into the series an unexpected plot twist arises which honestly makes the series far worse than what it could've been. The series does however recover after awhile but then falls in the pitfall of repeating the same type of problem in a different fashion all the way up till the last few episodes making the ending feel less satisfying than it could've been._________Conclusion_________I enjoyed Jeanie for what it was, but I think that if I had known beforehand that the show's strength went down in the second half I would've enjoyed it more for the simple fact my expectations were higher after the first stronger half. If you're looking for an old-school anime with enjoyable characters and like anime such as the Worldmasterpiece theater ones then I whole heartedly recommend you give this one a try!""]"
Kimi no Iru Machi OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20649/Kimi_no_Iru_Machi_OVA,"[""I at least feel now in part I know some of the backstory with some of the characters, but as a tradition with this series, it does it in a stupid order not following any timeline in order.Sadly to me, this is the best of the series and other OVA, as I found the others trash and this bad to bad at best.   To me, the OVA's just seem to be here to plug some of the gaps of a poor method of a story adapted to anime.It did make it feel more harem'y with Akari's kiss but good to see Rin...was still as jealous and manipulative as ever.   It however feels like desperate trash people when you add it all up, willing to go behind each other's back to win a guy, and sooner or later, hurt anyone in the process.The stories are not great, the art is better than the last ova and the sound is about the same.    Some of the characters feel filled out a little more, but as I have said, a decent writer would have done the job without  OVA's to fall back on.It just adds a little extra value to me, as Haruto is out of Eba's life again we hear, the timeline of it, I do not have a clue on it, as that's how this anime works, I dunno if is the time he is with Azuka.   Sadly is that sort of anime as I watch, so you may know everything that's happened, but be clueless at stages exactly when.And at the end we see them back together, with no reason why, or no idea how long passed or how they find each other again after the talk of them not talking recently. was still as jealous and manipulative as ever.

Kodomo no Jikan Ni Gakki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4195/Kodomo_no_Jikan_Ni_Gakki,"['Chances are those of you who finished the first installment of this highly controversial anime came to the realization that there is more here than loli fanservice, and this second installment almost seems to be a reward for those of you who watched it for the surprisingly effective drama. Make no mistake, though, Rin and her friends are all still up to their old perverted tricks, but with tighter writing, a stronger balance of comedy and drama, and a wider character focus, Kodomo no Jikan\'s Second Term is even better than the first.Starting as Rin and her class enters fourth grade, the characters themselves also...enter a poignant growth stage within the series, both adults and kids. Probably the most laudable of Second Term\'s achievements is thus delving beyond Rin into the psyches of her friends Kuro and Mimi, and even the strict Shirae-sensei in powerful and heartbreaking glimpses of their deepest fears and realizations. Perhaps the most notable of these is Kuro-chan\'s ambition to make Shirae-sensei her friend, an ambition that opens old wounds in Shirae-sensei and uncovers deep scars of how Kuro lives her life. Though the Second Term is a short one, the character development plunges to unfathomable depths, broadening the scope of the series theme of kids who want to be treated as grownups by making the kids themselves mirrors to the adults\' emotional statuses.The story has also become much tighter. The jokes are still there, and still as funny as they are disturbing, but they are balanced much better here than they were before. The weight behind the sexual overtones of the series has also become heavier. Now they are shown from specific perspectives that deepen characterization rather than just provide a screenshot where one can yell ""Call Chris Hansen!"" It’s unnerving, yes, but those who have the stomach to handle such provocative imagery will see past that into what is becoming a darker coming-of-age tale than previously thought to be.The technical aspects are still nice. The artwork is clean though the character designs are still uncomfortable and probably always will be. Vocal performances are strong as ever though, the second episode especially is full of dynamic performances by Eri Kitamura, Kei Shindou, and Mai Kadowaki who have quite clearly come to understand their prepubescent roles. The BGM is rehashed and still decent, while the OP/EDs have taken a dramatic turn downward in quality unfortunately.It\'s not an easy anime to watch but it is a thoughtful and provocative one. The drama is darker, the comedy is more balanced, and the characters have grown tremendously. The Second Term is a triumph over the first series, tightening its looser elements and keeping what made it enjoyable in the first place. With how good I thought this installment of episodes was, it\'s my hope that this is not the last we have seen of the Kodomo no Jikan anime.Overall, I give Kodomo no Jikan Second Term a 9 out of 10. enter a poignant growth stage within the series, both adults and kids.

It ended in a way all of the characters have learned a huge thing about life, Aoki, Kokonoe and Seiji. It didn't end in a disappointing way at all, I didn't feel the need to know anything more, the ending of the first season ended in a way that let us dream about their future, but...implied it would be happy anyways. Not a whole lot of interesting stuff could happen after what has already happened.Since they are like 1 or 2 years older and they all start to grow up, you would assume kokonoe, mimi and kuro would be even more mature but they're just not. Kokonoe lived so much intense stuff and doesn't act like she did. Mimi is even shier and kuro is even more uninteresting. The characters are counter-intuitive of what the pre-quel wanted to be.But honestly all the content of the meager 4 episodes are just recycled patterns and reactions / problem solving of the mid-series of the first season and also sub-characters development. They just mimicked the old personalities and put them in some situations. What makes it horrid, is that everything and anything that made tbe original story good was the characters and the relations they had between each other. They butchered this principle in Ni gakki.I'll give as an example the f**king weird scene where kokonoe sucks Mimi's nipple.If you plan to watch this right after you just watched the sequel, don't. You'll find nothing satisfying. You'll lose your ferric opinion view about the sequel. implied it would be happy anyways.

Kodomo no Jikan OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3121/Kodomo_no_Jikan_OVA,"['It\'s very rare that I see an OVA that\'s better than the actual series, and of course you have to watch the source show prior.The characters were all made use of in a really nice way, the story was interesting and at times just plain beautiful. The fan service is a little weird but that\'s it\'s charm, and I never felt like the fan service was mindless either. The art and sound are the same as the main show so it\'s hard to review it entirely.There are a few more ""taboo"" scenes and moments and if you like that stuff then give this...a watch, you won\'t regret itOverall it was a nice experience that left me feeling very pleasant.(7/10) a watch, you won\'t regret itOverall it was a nice experience that left me feeling very pleasant.(7/10)', 'Both fortunately and unfortunately, I enjoyed the first two OVA episodes far more than season one as a whole. They really explored the deeper emotions of the more ""side-characters"".In episode one, though off to a very dirty start, I loved seeing things from Mimi\'s point of view rather than Aoki\'s. I resonate a lot with Mimi as a character, I was also shy as a child, and developed earlier than my classmates, and was teased as a result. I also shared Mimi\'s hidden wish for approval from adults, and was often envious of my pretty, outgoing friends and classmates. For some reason, I also...really enjoyed Mimi\'s realization that being in love with someone can bring out a side of someone that friends and family cannot, because this was a hard concept for me to grasp even as a teenager. It was a wonderful change up from ecchi and the mourning over Rin\'s mother.Episode two was even more enjoyable, I never would\'ve foreseen Kuro following Shirai-sensei around like a puppy dog! I was so delighted that they chose to expose Shirai\'s background, even if it wasn\'t as in-depth as I\'d hoped. Throughout season one, you can spot glimpses of caring and emotion behind her cold exterior, which made it impossible for me to dislike her. I also enjoyed seeing more of Kuro\'s struggle with accepting her homosexuality, a pleasant surprise that came with this OVA. In season one, they really trivialize, or perhaps simply normalize Kuro\'s crush on Rin. I didn\'t mind of course, but I really wanted some more detail, and the OVA granted that wish.I began episode three with such high expectation... however the series returned to it\'s ecchi roots, and went out with a yuri-filled bang.It was rather painful to watch, I had to take long breaks during the episode because I was so shocked and frankly a little upset. I was ashamed to even be watching it. I would not recommend watching episode 3 of the OVA even if you like Kodomo no Jikan.All I can do is try to overshadow the ecchi scenes with all of the funny and serious moments that I enjoyed so much.

Mahoutsukai Tai!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/629/Mahoutsukai_Tai,"[""I'm glad I had the chance to watch this when I was visiting a friend. I had always meant to see it--it's been a staple of anime canon for ages--but just had never gotten around to it.This is one of the few anime with a Petite Ditz as the main character where I did not spend most of the show wanting said ditz to choke. Sae is genuinely adorable and lovable, everything most anime heroines aspire to be. Her over-the-top klutziness is endearing as opposed to hackneyed and grating. She pulls off the old school &quot;Love Conquers All&quot; magical girl beautifully. She seems GENUINE.For...a short OVA that devotes a lot of its time to slapstick, I was pleased with the subtlety of character development and interactions. It really is a character story, in the end, all magic wands and hats aside, and that adds something special. By the end of six episodes I really did care about these characters and wonder about their welfare in the future (to be answered in the TV series), and that is the emotional tie every writer aspires to create between the characters and the reader.&quot;Mahou Tsukai Tai&quot; is not without flaw, of course. Some of the episodes drag with filler, and sometimes the slice-of-life aspects become dull. This slower pace is truly a relic of 80's and 90's anime, almost unseen in modern shows, and in that I find a nostalgic value.This aside, if you don't require your anime to feature guns, vampires, or giant robots to enjoy it, and if you are not adverse to overwhelming helpings of cute, I recommend giving this show a try. a short OVA that devotes a lot of its time to slapstick, I was pleased with the subtlety of character development and interactions.

I am not sure if it could truly be considered a &quot;magical girl&quot; title (at least not in the traditional sense anyway) since there are no transformations or any kind of staple magical attack.As far as the story goes, it centers around a mysterious giant bell that has oddly appeared from...space one day. Mankind was no match for it, and thus people now have to live with the fact that this immense object looms over head. To sum it up, about half of the title will contain action sequences with the girls fighting off a monster from the bell, while the other half will usually be about life in school or at home. Sometimes I started to get the feeling that some of the episodes were leaning a bit on the &quot;filler&quot; side, that some parts of the story seemed just a bit pointless to the overall plot. But I think it did a pretty good job of developing the over all story and concept, and they do wrap things up in the end. What makes the story enjoyable, is not the plot itself--but the characters, they really know how to interact with one another well. You also get a pretty decent variety in this, such as: magic, slice of life, comedy, and lite romance themes. My only disappointment is that none of the character relations were resolved, though as anime fans it sadly something we have to get use to in a lot of series in general. I know...I hate it when it ends like that too!The characters are all fleshed out quite nicely in this anime, yet at the same time nothing new; Sae is your typical girl who doesn&rsquo;t have the confidence in herself, Nanka has the spunky spirit of the group, and Akane flakes any chance she gets. (yet surprisingly there really is no true moe character in this) With that in mind however, none of the girl&rsquo;s personalities ever come out as annoying, in fact the only character that ever kind of annoyed me was a boy named &quot;Takeo.&quot; He rarely ever acts serious when the time calls for it, and falls more in the category of &quot;goofy&quot; than anything else. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just felt he tended to over do it at times. Oh and the character Ayanojyo? He will most likely crack you up with his hilarious pick up lines on Takeo. The homosexual tension between the two is used as a running gag throughout the series, due to the fact that Takeo is straight. Sae is the one that stole the show for me though, she is the kinda character you just can&rsquo;t help but root for despite her self consciousness. They are overall a very endearing and lovable cast!The clarity of the anime definitely shows its age when compared to now-a-days anime (1996 title), but just because its an older title doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t stand up against some of the other magic series out there, the character design is what stands out the most as far as art goes, all of them have a good sense of style and appeal...and not to mention color. The backgrounds and environments were pretty decent to look at too, though it was kind of a hit and miss at some points, not all were as detailed as others. The only bummer about the art is the lack of stylized magical attacks. The characters do display some, but they are not very flashy or interesting to look at.The soundtrack to this title is also quite charming. Both the opening and closing have a nice catchy beat...as does the main BG theme that plays throughout, even though I would say only one was actually memorable. The soundtrack is by no means the best out there in this genera, but it does the anime justice! Surprisingly both the dub and sub form were quite good, both seemed to match the characters pretty nicely.

But now that I finally found it on Nozomi Entertainment\'s YouTube channel, what I found was a product of its time that\'s aged rather poorly.  Or maybe I\'ve just grown too far out of the target demographic.I\'d heard that this was a magical girl series going in, and while that\'s technically not wrong, it\'s pretty clear that it expects its audience to identify more...with the pervy guy who runs the club than any of the girls.  At least it never quite hits harem territory, even if it\'s about a nerdy guy, the hot young women that surround him, and a gay guy whose only character trait for 90% of the series is to ""humorously"" hit on that nerdy guy (I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen an anime filled with as many gay panic jokes as this one, and it\'s exactly as uncomfortable as it sounds).  The main girl still has a lot of screentime and a character arc, but it\'s nothing deep or that interesting.  Sae\'s whole thing is that she\'s clumsy and doesn\'t believe in herself, which she feels the need to tell everyone around her over and over again, until she finally learns to believe in herself.  It\'s the same kind of thing you\'ve seen plenty of times, usually done better than this.That isn\'t to say that everything about it fails.  The alien threat is interesting in that it actually manages to feel alien and isn\'t like anything I\'ve seen in a magical girl series before.  I liked the gag early on where two of the girls treat being part of a group of magic users trying to get into a big fight with aliens as boring and worth blowing off.The nerdy guy\'s absurd pervy fantasies managed to make me laugh once, even if they failed more often than not.  And there was one small story arc between the gay guy and one of the girls that ended up being kind of sad and sweet.  I just wish the rest of the show could have had an emotional core like that.This probably still makes it sound like I disliked the show more than I did.  It\'s hardly awful, and I don\'t regret my time watching it.  I feel like I would have been really into it if I\'d seen it at around age 14, but in my early 30s, I don\'t feel like there\'s a whole lot for me here. with the pervy guy who runs the club than any of the girls.

It\'s the same kind of thing you\'ve seen plenty of times, usually done better than this.That isn\'t to say that everything about it fails.  The alien threat is interesting in that it actually manages to feel alien and isn\'t like anything I\'ve seen in a magical girl series before.  I liked the gag early on where two of the girls treat being part of a group of magic users trying to get into a big fight with aliens as boring and worth blowing off.The nerdy guy\'s absurd pervy fantasies managed to make me laugh once, even if they failed more often than not.  And there was one small story arc between the gay guy and one of the girls that ended up being kind of sad and sweet.  I just wish the rest of the show could have had an emotional core like that.This probably still makes it sound like I disliked the show more than I did.  It\'s hardly awful, and I don\'t regret my time watching it.  I feel like I would have been really into it if I\'d seen it at around age 14, but in my early 30s, I don\'t feel like there\'s a whole lot for me here.', 'Mahoutsukai Tai\xa0was released as an OVA in \'96 & \'97 from Production Reed. The OVA spawned a whole bunch of follow up media including manga and a thirteen episode anime. The good news is that this is the same studio that brought us Nuku Nuku. The bad news is they also brought us Nuku Nuku Dash. So, I have no idea how this one is going to turn out.Story:Our story begins with invaders from space. They declare themselves in charge and defeat the forces sent against them. They proceed to hang around, doing nothing unless provoked and just kind of observing. They even obey traffic...laws. Well, that\'s a convenient invading force. They don\'t care if we keep governing ourselves and going about things as normal. They just want to hang around. Our protagonists are part of a High School magic club and they accidentally draw the aliens\' attention when they\'re going to attack their Bell-like base because their leader wants to impress the girls in the club.I could poke into all the dumb elements of the plot, but the OVA is ostensibly a comedy. So, the dumb stuff is pretty much by design for comedic effect. What I will criticise the OVA for is that the humour is fairly lacklustre. This is one of those comedies where the best it gets is being ""kind of funny"" with the potential to be funnier if there was a stronger build up. Take, for example, Akane decide to inflate a dude because he\'s, supposedly, being creepy. That\'s kind of funny. If they had more set up where we could see what this guy did to deserve being inflated like a balloon, it might have very well been funnier.And that\'s when the jokes are at the high level of ""kind of funny."" A lot of the time, they\'re just not funny. There are a lot of ""jokes"" that basically boil down to Takeo acting pervy towards the girls or Ayanojou making unwanted advances towards Takeo. Basically, a lot of shit that\'s a bit uncomfortable. At least they don\'t delve into full gay joke territory, though they border on it at times.Characters:The characters are pretty one note archetypal. Which would be fine since you don\'t need incredibly deep or complex characters in a comedy. You just need characters with strong comedic interactions. Which doesn\'t happen in this series. The dynamics are just generally trite and kind of boring.Art:The artwork is basically passable. It can be overly crass with the fan-service at times and the alien designs are boring. They\'re just a lot of circles, mechanical tentacles with eyes at the end of them and vaguely humanoid androids. Other than that, it\'s functional.Sound:They got some really good actors like Koyasu Takehito or Iizuka Mayumi but the performances are pretty mediocre. Probably because this is one of those comedies where they try to compensate for the lack of strong jokes with a lot of exaggeration. Oshima Michiru\'s music is decent enough. It\'s a bit more standard than her tracks usually are, but it\'s better than the soundtrack for Kaze no Tairiku, at least.Ho-yay:There\'s all the stuff with Ayanojou flirting with Takeo. It\'s very clear that it\'s one-sided though.Areas of Improvement:Stop the fan-service with adolescent girls. Somewhere, some dude named Donald who never bathes, is in his forties and on a government watch list is into that. But it\'s still tawdry. Plus, it does limit your audience when you get really fan-servicey with teenage girls. Teenagers may get excited for it. Donald is into it. For the rest of us, it\'s just trashy.Better set ups for the jokes. Having Sae decide she\'s going to be less clumsy only to immediately fall over isn\'t all that funny. Having her decide she was going to be less clumsy, last a while and then fall over when she\'s feeling proud of herself would be funnier. Either way, it\'s obvious that she\'s going to fail. The second method just gives some build up to it instead of an immediate pay off because they think the people watching this will forget the set up if the joke stemming from it isn\'t immediate.Take more advantage of the magic. For a work with magic as a central element, they don\'t do much with it in terms of the comedy. About the furthest they go is Takeo accidentally shrinking himself. And even then they barely do anything with him being shrunk. You could do all sorts of crazy comedic stuff with magic as a tool. And I feel that\'s where this OVA could have shined, if they\'d done a better job taking advantage of it.Final Thoughts:This is another one I can\'t really call bad. It has a lot of problems. It\'s certainly not good. But it does have its kind of funny moments and it is only six episodes long. So, if you like the idea of aliens fighting wizards, you might enjoy it.

I\'m giving it a 4/10.', ""Magic User's Club is an anime with a stunning visual style, where it is obvious at every turn that a great deal of passion and dedication went in to every scene. However, beneath this mastercraft veneer, is something so typical and unremarkable that it is shocking. The content within this anime is essentially what you'd get if you asked some random uninterested stranger what they thought anime was like. It's by no means necessarily bad, it's just not really all that special. Without the visual aspect, Magic User's Club would have nothing left to set it apart. Beginning with the story, it at least has...an intriguing enough concept, with the looming presence of alien machines studying the earth, sizing it up for invasion, and the response of a bunch of high school students to that presence with the use of magic. However, past the very initial premise, there's no real substance here. It follows your typical color-by-numbers tale of a magical girl using the power of believing in herself to save the world. There are love triangles and crushes, and all the tropes and jokes and slapstick and thinly-veiled-fetishes one has come to expect from a lot of anime. And I say this as someone who actually finds a lot of these anime tropes fun, and think they lend a certain character to the medium when used right, but here it's just kind of lazy. You can tell from the first episode how everything is going to end, and that really shouldn't be the case. Beyond this, the funny moments are really hit-or-miss. I did find myself chuckling every now and then, but some things get dry quick when you get to episode 4 of the same joke. I want to reiterate here, it's not bad, it's just not strictly good. But man, the art makes this mid show look absolutely amazing. Magic User's Club is one of the greatest examples of what 90s anime has to offer visually. Everything from the color to the seamless animation and minute detail come together to paint a picture of immense and timeless beauty. It strikes at the very core of what makes this era of animation so good. Personally, my favorite aspects of the art, and indeed the entire show, are the backgrounds and the character design. The backgrounds are in and of themselves masterpieces of color and technique, balancing mood and composition in ways which bring the world to life. Then, within this living world, the character designs exude a unique vitality, blending realism and style which breathes life into the characters which they portray, and giving them a physicality which invests you in their wellbeing against your better judgement. The sound meanwhile is pretty good, with a semi-orchestral OST which focuses on dramatism while taking a backseat to the art. The sounds of life are lacking however, lost in the music and unremarkable voice work. The characters, while they might bear visually compelling designs, fall flat in their substance, just like the story does, and they lean on their tropes almost entirely to function. Not a single person in the main cast manages to rise above this, and as such they remain pretty mid even when compared to smaller projects of the same era, and in fact I found a couple pretty unlikable. When it comes to choosing favorites, there's only one character that really stands out to me, and that's Minowa, the journalist. I think, because he's a secondary character, he manages to avoid the garbage treatment the main characters got, which lead to him being unique and interesting, and to some degree, genuine. This is especially demonstrated in a particular conversation he has with one of the more interesting members of the main cast, Aikawa, near a beach bonfire. On this note, I want to say that overall, this anime had potential. It really did have the makings of something great. With a visual element so impactful that it can turn a 5 like this into a 7, imagine what it could have done to a show which was a 7 at its core. I think, if they just spent a little more time on everything else, this could have been amazing. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and the later TV adaptation robs this show of its art, which is once again to say, the only thing that makes it good. So, we're stuck with this as it is. Magic User's Club is not a bad anime, and it's certainly one of the better looking shows I've watched, but that's not all there is to greatness. There needs to be something under the hood, and this just doesn't have that something. Watch it for the visuals alone, as I really cannot recommend it on any other metric. an intriguing enough concept, with the looming presence of alien machines studying the earth, sizing it up for invasion, and the response of a bunch of high school students to that presence with the use of magic.

Seriously, the visuals for this were great and looked like a ton of effort went into them. I found myself frequently pausing to admire the art.>Character personalities are simple but effective, particularly for humour.Cons:>Lame cliche plot....>Too much time spent on \'wacky oh-so-funny\' boring action scenes used to advance said cliche plot.>Too much slapstick humour in general (I know, it\'s anime).I probably won\'t be watching the TV anime version as apparently it is much worse than the OVAs.Overall 7/10Yes, I\'d recommend these as a casual thing to watch.

Mamoru-kun ni Megami no Shukufuku wo!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1588/Mamoru-kun_ni_Megami_no_Shukufuku_wo,"[""Mamoru-kun is a cute little romantic comedy that is often overlooked.  It's not really a masterpiece that's going to end up on a lot of people's top-10 lists, but it's quite enjoyable for what it is.  I'd put it in the same category as Kamisama Kazoku and Midori no Hibi - light romantic comedy that's not meant to be taken too seriously.The very first thing you need to figure out is if you are able to accept the concept of a male lead who looks like he's 10 years old.  Some people have a hard time accepting Mamoru and if you feel...the same way, you're not going to be able to get very far into the show.The characters as a whole were very entertaining.  Ayako does her take on a different type of tsundere.  The student council support staff each have their quirks and each bring a little something to the show.  I loved that they &quot;borrowed&quot; the student council girls for some funny temporary harem situations, but on the whole the story focused on Mamoru and Ayako.The humor in the show was better and more innovative than I was expecting.  That's not to say the show doesn't indulge in a lot of school life romance cliches, but they love throwing little unexpected twists in there sometimes.  One example is the obligatory onsen episode.  They definitely take it in another direction and it's my favorite onsen episode in any romantic comedy anime.The story was pretty decent as far as romantic comedies go.  I thought the ending arc was pretty weak, though.  What I did like was that the confession came in the first episode so we don't have to spend a whole series watching awkward school kids try to figure out how to confess to each other.  The series instead spends its time showing how the two main characters develop the relationship.So, to sum up, Mamoru-kun is an enjoyable romantic comedy for people looking for something in that genre.  It's not a masterpiece, but it has enough good points to be a solid recommendation for folks looking for a romantic comedy. the same way, you're not going to be able to get very far into the show.The characters as a whole were very entertaining.

Not a harem situation, just a love triangle. Is it set in a high school for magic-users/monster-trainers/psychics? Presto: Mamoru-kun.It\'s not that this show is egregiously bad - the OP is a little annoying and the art and animation is rather lame for a show that aired in 2006, but you can skip the opening and comedies don\'t need stunning visuals to be funny - it\'s that there\'s nothing compelling to draw in the viewers.The story here is pretty basic: Mamoru, the shouta-looking untalented hero joins a prestigious school to become stronger, and immediately falls...in love with the notorious, hot-tempered, and powerful Ayako. The problem with this is that Ayako falls equally as hard in love with Mamoru, so any attempted romantic drama falls short of being convincing. People familiar with romances will notice scenarios like: ""Ayako/Mamoru is avoiding me, does she/he not like me anymore?"" No, they were just busy making you a present.Being set in a school based around super powers, there are also a number of villains that appear who are made out to be menacing, but once they appear, they do little aside from trying to break up the main couple. By the time everything is over, everyone is friends, because friendship/love is the greatest power in the world.Perhaps the best thing that could be said about the show is that several of the minor characters absolutely shine in the comedy department. The antics of the student council president, Maya, who also has feelings for Ayako, and his younger sister, Shione, with her ridiculous hair, in their attempts to tease/cheer up Ayako are delightful. The large, muscular dude who is constantly spouting Engrish is a hoot as well. Ayako\'s romantic rival, the short, flat-chested Emelenzia, is hilarious in her repeated failed attempts at seducing Mamoru. But all of this just reflects back on how weak the leading pair are: while Ayako avoids the tsundere stereotype by being constantly lovey-dovey towards Mamoru while thrashing anyone else who irritates her, the report between the two lacks the tenderness that makes established couples like Keiichi and Belldandy or Aoi and Kaoru enjoyable to watch.Because the superiority of the supporting cast and the mediocrity of the primary couple, the best episodes are the light-hearted ones, like when Shione suddenly shows up with her hair hanging straight, the Valentines episode when everyone (muscular Engrish-speaker include) make chocolates for Mamoru, or an explosive - literally -  mission to peep on the girls in a hot spring. The serious episodes lack a sense of danger or an original twist to make them interesting.The art is utterly forgettable, except for a fireworks display in one of the episodes that makes one think that the person in charge of animating it was an amateur who had just discovered 3D CG effects. Sound was likewise passable but left little lasting impression.All in all, this show has it\'s moments, but there are much better ways to spend your time. in love with the notorious, hot-tempered, and powerful Ayako.

The art in regards to specail effects and character models was excellent! Not to mention the characters expression of emotion was top not for romance comedy! The plot itself was good as it wasnt the &quot;boy protects girl&quot; but rather &quot;girl protects boy and needs boy to do so&quot;. Sound was nothing special as some of the background music i heard was rather poorly placed. Overall though, this show gives of a great feel, but lacks enough originallty to break my top 5. Definently top 10 though! I JUST HATE HOW HES SO GOD DAM SHORT THOUGH!!!!! UHHH!!! ', ""One of the best romantic comedies in a sense. This is a very enjoyable series and has a bit of &quot;magic&quot; thrown in. From the start, Mamoru is kind of an ackward piece of anime, but gets much better the longer you watch it. Like the others that have written reviews already, this definitely belongs near the top of this category.The story brings out the best of the characters in my eyes. The show doesn't stick straight to the oncoming disasters ahead, nor does it just show straight comedy with an added bit of romance. It gradually lets the characters grow and become a force...to be reckoned with. haha. The ending is good, but could have been a little better in my eyes. Although, I can't really think of a way to change it to make it any better.The artwork is pretty good. It wouldn't be at the same level as a Key animation but the anime keeps the &quot;kawaii feel&quot; while showing the awesome-ness of a magic (beatrice) anime.The sound for the anime is decent and doesn't ruin the anime in the least, but it has little to be desired for. The only exeception that I liked from this anime is the music that is played during the different points of &quot;showing off their skill with beatrice.&quot; The artwork becomes good at these points too, so be careful not to miss either part.I'm not really good at conclusions, but this anime is a fun watch and is the masterpiece that isn't in the spot light. I only found it by chance! It is and isn't your typical romantic comedy in many ways, but I'm sure you'll understand that statement as you watch it!!! to be reckoned with. haha.

Yes for the person searching for a deep, overly dramatic and moving story this anime is not going to give you that. but for many viewers who want a enjoyable romance with some action, where the drama between characters doesn't make you want to strangle someone THEN THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU! The main male character Yoshimura, Mamoru is great for a romance fan, while he is small and not the strongest character he is a Man. He doesn't make you want to physically harm him like other shows because...he isn't a pervert, he doesn't get crazy mood swings and the best part is he does know what he wants and he fights for it with everything he has. It was a nice break from the usual over the top drama. True all my opinion but as long as your looking for a light hearted romance/action you will very much enjoy this. he isn't a pervert, he doesn't get crazy mood swings and the best part is he does know what he wants and he fights for it with everything he has.

This is an old anime I watched years ago, and I remember it as having a fun cast, and really funny jokes.my love for over-the-top action and unnecessary fight scenes probably started around this time.My love for romance animes and its tropes was in full bloom around this time.One of the most memorable scenes that brought me back to this anime was in episode 1 with the cherry blossoms and the FL entering the school.But I think you would not enjoy it now because the tropes are outdated and the ML she falls for, appearance-wise isn't great and there is a crazy height...difference to the point where you'd think he was her little brother but he really is a sweet guy.The main trope being strong and independent FL falls for an unassuming and unimportant guy.I can't wait to watch it again and visit later to update this review. difference to the point where you'd think he was her little brother but he really is a sweet guy.The main trope being strong and independent FL falls for an unassuming and unimportant guy.I can't wait to watch it again and visit later to update this review.""]"
Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14829/Fate_kaleid_liner_Prisma☆Illya,"[""I am the bone of my spin offs.Yuri is my body, moe is my blood.I have resulted in over a thousand boners.Known to lolicons.But not to you filthy casuals....Have withstood magical girls and their self aware banter.Yet, those viewers only care about the yuri scenes.So as I pray... UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have?

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is.', 'Do you like loli?Do you like spin-off anime of excellent series that have nothing to do with said excellent series?Do you like a show that can’t decide what the hell it wants to be?Then sit down and watch Fate/Kaleid, a ten episode anime that is full of everything you love about Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night, such as hilarious comedy, underaged lesbians, and magical girls. You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that.

The character designs themselves are pretty attractive too along...with background art and general animation as well.Now in the scripting and story department, I'd say it ranges from average to above average. What I appreciate about it is how the dialogue has the characters actually feel like kids as even Miyu, despite her seemingly mature nature, is still immature in many other aspects. The characters, or atleast Illya and Miyu, actually have conflicts based on the story and even between each other and it highlights their inner character and mentalities rather nicely. However, the only thing that holds this anime back from being greater is that its story/aesthetics are very, very lackluster.To help understand this try to reference other magical girl anime, in my case I'm thinking of Sailor Moon for the aesthetics. At the beginning of the series, Prisma☆Illya's aesthetic was seemingly being a parody of magical girl anime as it makes jokes or references tropes seen in those anime and while it wouldn't be the first of this kind of thing it would've left a stronger impression on me if it was rather than the direction it ended up in (not to say it's poorly written but rather it didn't have much going for it that you couldn't find in other magical girl anime and done better).Without that aesthetic Prisma☆Illya had in the beginning, it becomes more of a generic magical girl anime with nothing making it stand out from the rest other than having Fate characters.Even with all this, I can say this is a fine anime with a clear amount of thought and effort put into it. I'd say the thought put in it could be a reason to give this a try alone, while I do believe I wouldn't miss anything if I never ended up watching the show, I certainly still somewhat enjoyed my time watching despite conking out from moment to moment.

Give it a try."", 'Since I can\'t be bothered to write a review for all three seasons that currently exist of Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya, which will be shortened to Fate/Kaleid or variations of that for the rest of this review, this will apply to all of them.Don\'t let the apathetic attitude from the first paragraph mislead you, I love Fate/Kaleid, to the point where I was unable to watch any other anime until halfway through my 3rd back-to-back rewatch of the show because I just wanted to be watching Fate/Kaleid.Fate/Kaleid does something that I see so many animes, including the original Fate/Stay Night 2006 adaptation, forget...about. They actually show the normal lives of the characters beyond episode 1. I\'ve seen so many TV shows arbitrarily decide that the magical adventure the characters are on is more important and interesting than their normal lives, and while this may be true in some cases, it also undermines the characters\' motivations. Who cares if you\'re fighting to save the world from being destroyed if all we see of the world is the main characters fighting the bad guys? Fate/Kaleid will dedicate episodes to the characters just having a normal day, with a healthy amount of comedy thrown in.This is something else Fate/Kaleid does well. It\'s one of the few animes that has legitimately made me laugh. Comedy in anime so often will either fall flat immediately or become overused to the point where it falls flat. Fate/Kaleid does neither, interspersing it where it needs to be and allowing the serious elements their time. It helps that the characters are often so adorable that I want to punch a steak to feel like a man again before I remember that my fists have all the power of a reasonably enthusiastic puppy and I give up entirely.The show is not without its flaws. Tatsuko is obnoxious more often than funny (though thankfully she\'s only a recurring character rather than a main character), some of the rules of magic get wonky or nonsensical at times, and season 2 and beyond include some uncomfortable ""mana siphoning"" instances that make me start to wonder who exactly those scenes were made for.I still have more to say but I fear this review has gotten too long and is almost entirely just me gushing about how much I like this show. It\'s probably not for everybody, but I know I sure loved it, which is especially impressive because I thought Fate/Stay Night was rotting trash. In the interest of ending on a light note, Fate/Kaleid is like watching a puppy and a kitten snuggle up together in the fur of a large bunny.

I'll be blunt it is not like previous series and that is fine! Animation, is top notch as usual, didn't find any of the ost to particularly stand out, the new mains were alright, I do enjoy seeing some of our old favorites again :) even if some of them don't actually talk... ha  but all else aside was pleased with this first season. My biggest disappointment here is character development; I know there is still 3 seasons I have left to watch so my opinion on...the matter may very well change, also this season only had 12 episodes to do what it did. That being said, I still like my shows to have a little more depth to them (and this may just be me getting to old lol) and this one seemed a little superficial in nature. I did enjoy it though! Many laughs, much wow, such funny haha.  I do plan on finishing the series, but nothing from this 1st season makes me want to rush into it to finish without delay like other shows do at 3 am lol the matter may very well change, also this season only had 12 episodes to do what it did.

I\'ll try to keep it ""as short as possible"" and let\'s begin!A few days ago I thought that I should finally go through all of the fate/series, since I had watched all of Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay night (all three routes until Heaven\'s feel 2nd movie) and some of the separate Fate titles too. And what better title to start with, if not with this, that has 3 seasons and...movies + ova\'s, but is it worth it? Yes, yes it was and here\'s why.When I started watching this series I wasn\'t exactly hyped about the magical girls in a Fate world. Of course I knew, that somehow it would be connected to the main idea, but never like this. (in a good way) You could probably watch this without even checking the original titles, but you would miss a lot of the small things and details that were in anime. My recommendation is that you watch atleast Fate/Zero before this and if possible also Fate/Stay Night, there is a reason for it and I will explain it a little bit later.So, as for the story, from what I have seen so far, which is till the latest (at this moment) ova movie ""PRISMA☆PHANTASM"", is that it\'s really well written. It progresses at a nice pace, where it makes you think that it\'s just another magical girl anime and just slowly goes total Fate mode. It\'s so good that I barely can hold myself from not telling a bunch of spoilers connected to it, but don\'t worry I won\'t tell you, because it would be a waste to spoil it. It makes sense that the writer made a separate story for this MC (main character) because in the title Fate/Stay night, where MC showed up for the first time, she didn\'t exactly have a lot of screen time, even though she was kinda an important character plot wise and I\'m happy that she got her own title. As for the other characters, I don\'t really see any real problem there, yeah, sometimes you get the usual anime tropes where emotions are a little bit weird or amplified, but that\'s in every anime, so I cannot exactly call that a flaw, plus the characters are young, so it makes sense if they sometimes act like a child, because they are. Another thing that I could mention is that this story is a bit easier to watch then some of the other titles and I think that anyone will agree with me on that.Design wise, no problem here at all, the art style is a bit different from the other Fate titles, but in the 3 season (I think) it gets a few small tweaks. It was probably because of fan recommendations or they just felt that they need to keep some of the original looks from Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay night. Though, even if they wouldn\'t have made a change, I think it still would be good anyway. And combined with the excellent audio design that is IN LITERALLY EVERY FATE TITLE, it makes it stand well next to the other Fate titles. Plus, fun fact that I noticed later, is that this might be a separate continuation of Fate/Zero, just like Fate/Stay night, which is why I said, that you could miss a few things, so, you might want to consider my previous offer, before starting this title.Overall I give this anime a solid 9, because when you look at everything together, you can see how well it has been planned and written. Yeah, some of the ova\'s are not the greatest, but at the same time, it doesn\'t ruin the main story in any shape or form, besides you get some nice scenes from time to time too. *wink *wink ¬‿¬I think you\'re already tired from me so, I hope this helps and have fun watching, PEACE!

XD', ""Forget almost everything you know about Mahou Shoujos: you don't see the same transformations and same attack animations every episode, which is a plus in my book.This anime is perfect if you want to get a little more of that lovely Fate universe but also want to chill and relax for a little bit. The story is about magical girls with the Fate cast and the seiyuus are the same.The animation and soundtrack are pretty solid. The fights are a beauty to watch, except the CGI used on the last episode. I also felt that the last episode's pace was too slow.The...verdict is that this gets a 7/10 from me.SPOILERS:1) hated the sexist versions of Archer's and Saber's outfits. Saber's outfit is even worse because she's already a female character but suddenly for Mayu it needs to show more skin!!!! I don't mind fanservice but don't ruin their awesome-looking clothes2) Would have preferred to see Illya as a Berserker than an Archer3) I missed Gilgamesh but maybe in the sequel verdict is that this gets a 7/10 from me.SPOILERS:1) hated the sexist versions of Archer's and Saber's outfits.

Fate Ilya (as I will call it) is about an almost normal elementary girl, Ilya, who is suddenly burdened with having to collect magical cards representing each of the seven Fate warrior types. She is joined by her mentor, a hot-headed Tousaka, and another pair of mahou shoujo and mentor. This part-comedy part-action thriller is overall a fun watch with a lot of parodies of other Fate works. I highly recommend watching shows that this references first (Fate/Stay Night, Fate Zero, and...Unlimited Blade Works) or your enjoyment will probably be cut by at least half (and you\'ll miss out on a lot of important, unexplained context). While the first few episodes may come a cross as light and childish in the mahou shoujo sense, the later episodes more than makes up for it with true Fate quality plot progression and storytelling. While not a perfect work, this is a fun and welcome addition to the Fate lineup.Animation:First off, let\'s calibrate expectations. Fate Zero and Unlimited Blade Works were tremendous feats of animation that were like piñatas full of eye candy. Fate Ilya is not in that tier but probably more in line with what we saw in Carnival Phantasm. Mind you, this series is actually animated by Silver Link, which has an overall mixed record with me. The overall series is well colored with good shading and appropriately light mahou moments and darker palettes fitting well with other Fate works. You can tell that the overall animation isn\'t as detailed as Ufotable works, but overall its decent by today\'s standards. Though some characters look slightly different (Tousaka and Shirou both looks younger), everyone is recognizable from previous Fate works. Seeing Tousaka in mahou shoujo garb is a humorous and worthy addition in and of itself. I won\'t give away specific characters, but do expect cameo appearances by various Fate warriors. My annoyances with this show include the (in my opinion) pointless transformation scenes and occasional abuse of CGI to pull of effects.There is significant action in this show. Though not at the Fate Zero level, you do get some pretty significant battles with a lot of effects and pretty clever tactics. A lot of trademark Fate attacks are showcased in the show in addition to the generic mahou shoujo energy blast attacks, an interesting and well thought out addition. Surprisingly, certain parts of the show are pretty dark. Expect blood and light amounts of gore. Fan service wise, there isn\'t much for the child-molesting crowd here.Sound:The show starts off with a very fitting OP with a nice melody. It ends with a playful tune fitting for the mahou shoujo theme. While the BGM is fair, you can easily tell that Yuki Kajiura wasn\'t involved with this series.The VA cast is full of Fate veterans including the always welcome Kana Ueda and Mai Kadowaki. As a bonus, we even get a pompous performance from Shizuja Itou. Given the strong cast, you can expect a very good performance overall.Story:Rin Tousaka and Edelfelt, magical students and rivals, are given two magic wands as support in a mission to retrieve magical cards in our favorite Fate city. The two are in a pointless feud that irks their sentient wands into abandoning them and finding new masters. Thus, Ilya and a mysterious, quiet girl named Miyu become involved in the quest to retrieve the cards. Ilya gets more than she hoped for out of her ""fun"" experience as she\'s forced to fight for her life in order to help a virtual stranger retrieve these cards that have nothing to do with her. What challenges will the group face when they travel to the mirror world to retrieve the cards?The show starts off a bit slow as it introduces the mahou theme and presents a few comic moments. However, it quickly turns to the serious business of collecting the dangerous magical cards. Expect multiple episodes to end on fairly significant cliffhangers. The show builds to a final climax where Ilya and Miyu\'s friendship and trust are tested. While the show does not have anywhere near the depth and continuity of Fate Zero, it is still above average in both execution and overall entertainment value. Expect some surprise moments late in the show that Fate veterans will appreciate.Character:Ilya\'s predicament here feels very similar to that faced by Valvrave and Gundam Seed\'s protagonists, she\'s forced into a hostile and unexpected situation where she must either adapt or face death. I personally like these situations as it allows for a very natural, dynamic character progression. The series does a fairly good job of following that path, as well as exploring some issues revolving around Ilya\'s friendship with Miyu. Oh yes, you get a lot of screen time with Tousaka, although she and Edelfelt feel more static as they\'re locked in a seemingly endless feud.Value:Dead serious in certain moments and comically childish at others, Fate Ilya is, overall, a much lighter addition to the Fate universe. While not as deep and involved as other Fate works, it still came across as a enjoyable watch with lots of fun references to other Fate works. For those who have watched Phantasmoon from Carnival Phantasm, know that this is a much more focused work with an actual plot. Fate Ilya is a pretty good show that manages to unify the mahou shoujo and Fate themes without distorting the selling points of either category. As it\'s such a short show, I recommend giving it a go if you\'ve got nothing better to do.

The overall series is well colored with good shading and appropriately light mahou moments and darker palettes fitting well with other Fate works. You can tell that the overall animation isn\'t as detailed as Ufotable works, but overall its decent by today\'s standards. Though some characters look slightly different (Tousaka and Shirou both looks younger), everyone is recognizable from previous Fate works. Seeing Tousaka in mahou shoujo garb is a humorous and worthy addition in and of itself. I won\'t give away specific characters, but do expect cameo appearances by various Fate warriors. My annoyances with this show include the (in my opinion) pointless transformation scenes and occasional abuse of CGI to pull of effects.There is significant action in this show. Though not at the Fate Zero level, you do get some pretty significant battles with a lot of effects and pretty clever tactics. A lot of trademark Fate attacks are showcased in the show in addition to the generic mahou shoujo energy blast attacks, an interesting and well thought out addition. Surprisingly, certain parts of the show are pretty dark. Expect blood and light amounts of gore. Fan service wise, there isn\'t much for the child-molesting crowd here.Sound:The show starts off with a very fitting OP with a nice melody. It ends with a playful tune fitting for the mahou shoujo theme. While the BGM is fair, you can easily tell that Yuki Kajiura wasn\'t involved with this series.The VA cast is full of Fate veterans including the always welcome Kana Ueda and Mai Kadowaki. As a bonus, we even get a pompous performance from Shizuja Itou. Given the strong cast, you can expect a very good performance overall.Story:Rin Tousaka and Edelfelt, magical students and rivals, are given two magic wands as support in a mission to retrieve magical cards in our favorite Fate city. The two are in a pointless feud that irks their sentient wands into abandoning them and finding new masters. Thus, Ilya and a mysterious, quiet girl named Miyu become involved in the quest to retrieve the cards. Ilya gets more than she hoped for out of her ""fun"" experience as she\'s forced to fight for her life in order to help a virtual stranger retrieve these cards that have nothing to do with her. What challenges will the group face when they travel to the mirror world to retrieve the cards?The show starts off a bit slow as it introduces the mahou theme and presents a few comic moments. However, it quickly turns to the serious business of collecting the dangerous magical cards. Expect multiple episodes to end on fairly significant cliffhangers. The show builds to a final climax where Ilya and Miyu\'s friendship and trust are tested. While the show does not have anywhere near the depth and continuity of Fate Zero, it is still above average in both execution and overall entertainment value. Expect some surprise moments late in the show that Fate veterans will appreciate.Character:Ilya\'s predicament here feels very similar to that faced by Valvrave and Gundam Seed\'s protagonists, she\'s forced into a hostile and unexpected situation where she must either adapt or face death. I personally like these situations as it allows for a very natural, dynamic character progression. The series does a fairly good job of following that path, as well as exploring some issues revolving around Ilya\'s friendship with Miyu. Oh yes, you get a lot of screen time with Tousaka, although she and Edelfelt feel more static as they\'re locked in a seemingly endless feud.Value:Dead serious in certain moments and comically childish at others, Fate Ilya is, overall, a much lighter addition to the Fate universe. While not as deep and involved as other Fate works, it still came across as a enjoyable watch with lots of fun references to other Fate works. For those who have watched Phantasmoon from Carnival Phantasm, know that this is a much more focused work with an actual plot. Fate Ilya is a pretty good show that manages to unify the mahou shoujo and Fate themes without distorting the selling points of either category. As it\'s such a short show, I recommend giving it a go if you\'ve got nothing better to do.', 'Fate-kaleid liner Prisma☆IllyaYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S, IT’S SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD ~~~~ Not even yuri, not even mana sharing and it ended up being the best Fate related material in existence.

Fate/Kaleid is a great addition to the already expansive Fate universe acting as a pseudo Illya route for the people who wanted one. However, it\'s strong enough to stand alone as it\'s own separate show without the need of Fate universe knowledge. The show is just serious enough for the viewer to believe in the...peril that the characters get in as well as have several dark tones and themes through the series three seasons. Fate/Kaleid masterfully melds enough slice of life to build up the characters in order to make the drama have impact.Story:Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya follows Illyasviel Einsbern, a fifth grader, who unwillingly becomes a magical girl in order to collect class cards; a relic from the previous Holy Grail War. Although initially the anime adopts a ""monster of the week"" formula it slowly unveils it\'s overarching mystery about the reason for the cards existence, Illya and her friend Miyu backstory.Art:The bright colors used throughout the show is perfect for a show about magical girls, I mean they somehow made a fifth grader wearing pink apparel to look cool and badass and that\'s quite a feat. The animation is solid throughout the show with the fight scenes being a high point although it\'s no ufotable.Sound:Alright I\'m slightly bias because the series composer is Tatsuya Kato, and he\'s just the best goddamn composer in the anime industry. Not only does his tracks fit well with the show itself but there\'s a few notable tracks that are just fantastic by themselves as well as his take on the famous EMIYA track. The sound effects in Fate/Kaleid work for most of the parts, but some of the attacks lack a bit of ""umphf"" and sound a tad lackluster especially compared to some of the other anime out there like YZQ or ufotable UBW.I know I completely ignored the biggest complaint about the show, the yuri and fanservice, but Fate/Kaleid really is much more then that. peril that the characters get in as well as have several dark tones and themes through the series three seasons.

Others have adapted alternate routes of the visual novels that are part of Type-Moon’s Nasuverse (like Fate/Stay Night mostly adapting the Fate route and Unlimited Blade Works adapting that route). Fate/Prisma Illya is a true alternate take on the Fate Universe.If I was to draw a comparison to another work of anime or manga, I’d compare this to the Shinji Ikari Raising Project manga. Like Shinji Ikari Raising...Project, it’s set in an alternate universe where the parents (or foster parents in the case of Shirou) of the protagonist of the original work are still alive. The protagonist(s) have to contend with a challenge which is similar to but not exactly identical to the challenge of the original work, with a mostly similar cast and a similar themes, but with less severe stakes, and a less dire tone, and shifted to a different genreThere are a few differences here from that formula – Kiritsugu and Irisviel are still alive, but are generally absent, with Kiritsugu and Iris traveling on work, with instead the two Einzbern maids – Sella and Leysritt, acting en loco parentis while Kiritsugu and Iris are absent. Also, the series shifts the protagonist status to Illyasviel (Illya), which fits with the genre shift – to a Magical Girl show.The show follows Illya and a new character, Miyu. They are each recruited into being Magical Girls by two sentient Magical Girl Wands – Ruby and Sapphire (respectively) – both with the voices and personalities of Kohaku and Hisui of Tsukihime (respectively). Ruby and Sapphire were originally assigned to Rin Tohsaka (from Fate) and Luviagelita (Luvia) Edelfelt (who first appeared in the epilogue of UBW), who were in turn sent from the Magic Academy in London to retrieve a selection of “Class Cards” which has made an appearance in Fuyuki City. However, as we saw in the epilogue of UBW, Rin and Luvia get along like the components of a binary explosive. So, once Ruby and Sapphire have enough of Rin and Luvia’s bickering – they quit and find new masters.Rin and Luvia end up serving as mentors for Illya and Miyu (respectively), as they fight to acquire the class cards, which means in turn defeating dark versions of the various Heroic Spirits from Fate/Stay Night (except for Assassin – that version is True Assassin, instead of Koujiro). This gives series a structure like a more serious version of Cardcaptor Sakura, with Illya and Miyu having to take on the Servant of the Episode, with two servants already captured by the start of the series – Lancer and Archer.Illya and Miyu have an interesting character dichotomy. Illya is a more conventional magical girl – not only in costume design, but in terms of worldview. She’s a fan of magical girl anime, and when Ruby tricks her into being a Magical Girl, she rolls with it pretty quickly, and completely gets the genre conventions. However, this means that when things get too dangerous and very serious, she falls into a real depression, due to the rather scary situation she finds herself in.By comparison, Miyu falls into the archetype of the Dark Magical Girl. Like most versions of the archetype, the costume is more risque than the main magical girl. Miyu also has a more cynical outlook on life – and also a comedically serious worldview. Finally, she has a mysterious backstory that isn’t exactly explained in this season.The show has a few significant minuses. For starters, this show has a little too much fanservice. Because the show is a magical girl show, instead of Illya being the age she is in Fate/Stay Night (16-18 – but with her growth magically stunted as a tactical decision for the next Grail War), she’s clearly middle-school aged. Putting aside where it puts things in terms of the timeline (Shirou, Rin, and Luvia are the same age they are in Fate/Stay Night), this brings up the issue of, well, middle school characters in skimpy outfits.Specifically the “Install” costumes that Illya and Miyu have when they Install the various class cards are the worst offender of this. It’s like the various alternate “Equips” that Erza Scarlett has in Fairy Tail, except Erza is an adult, and these characters clearly aren’t. There’s some additional fanservice elsewhere that is unnecessary and off-putting, particularly in the episode where Illya learns Miyu is working as a maid for Luvia.Additionally, to shove some additional moe tropes into the show, Illya is a bro-con. Illya having something of a twisted romantic attraction to Shirou worked in the main timeline, as while they are semi-related, they have also been raised completely apart. Here, they’ve been raised together, so there’s no excuse. As Genshiken said about these sort of tropes: ""I can vouch that they are the result of fantasies by people who don\'t actually have a younger sister.""The pacing of the show is also rather rushed. Most TV anime, minimum, have a 12-episode cour. This show has a 10-episode cour. The series had already been approved for a second season by the end of the first season – but a little research has shown that season (and the two following seasons) have all run 10 episodes as well. Missing those two episodes actually hurts the pace of the series considerably. I can’t speak for how well the material in the show covers the same amount of the material in the manga, but from where I sit as a viewer, the show just felt rushed. That said, having three seasons coming after makes this more forgivable, as we can get more character development and world building in later episodes of the series.

And yet somehow the spin-off of the series turned out BRILLIANT. Also keep in mind that normally I don\'t like the whole magical girls idea thing at all.Rin (from Fate stay) and Levi (original I guess?), along with their 2 magical wands (...damn you Seitokai...) are on a mission to collect all the heroic spirit cards for the archmage in Germany. The wands, (Ruby & Sapphire) have a will of their own and eventually get tired of their masters\' constant fights, so they go ahead and choose new masters, 2 girls seemingly chosen at...random (in Ruby\'s case perhaps with a bit more illegal purposes in mind). Illya, daughter of Irisviel and Kiritsugu, is chosen by Ruby and Sapphire chooses Miyu, a homeless girl of unknown background. The former masters find the respective girls and decide to take them under protection/training in order to complete their mission.To be clear about the genre, the show has some very dark moments, but is still overflowed with fanservice by the 9 year olds (yes you heard right, no I don\'t care if you have ethical issues with that, get over it.). The second season, heavily influenced by 2014\'s homo aura introduces waaaaaayyyyyy too much yuri to the list (not that the first season was yuri-free). Something I really like about the show is that it doesn\'t let us forget that both Illya and Miyu are still children, they have many preteen problems to overcome + things they don\'t understand, which would actually make the series a bit too heavy on drama if it wasn\'t for the fanservice ""goofiness"".For the action part the anime does astoundingly well. The animations are great and there is no more talking than needed. The heroic spirits are all tough to beat, but more than physically they press the girls psychologically (the part I mentioned about them still being kids). Neither of them are actually prepared to ""fight to the death"" like Luvia and Rin are, and especially Illya will go through panic stages quite a few times. While we\'re at it, the anime does a FANTASTIC job with character developement. Both Illya and Miyu go through a looot of tough decisions regarding what they should do, what is right and how they feel about situations. Some could argue that Illya is way too whiny and a scaredy-cat but again people, it\'s f£%^ing 9year old.Things that I really loved about this anime:1)The ages of the characters fit their behaviour.2)Oooooh the wonderful fanservice...3)Good sense of humor.4)Fast-paced, very well animated battles. + the opponents take way more than ""a few good hits"" to be beaten.5)Ruby\'s character, just priceless.6)VERY dark and depressing moments at times.7) Saber going terminator even down to her walking style, wearing 50 KG plate armor while shooting off Getsuga Tenshous as predator music plays on the background while the girls have nearly pissed themselves. (The testosterone levels are rediculously high on this one.)It doesn\'t matter if you\'re a fan of the fate series or not.

While it is directed by the same director as C³ - which was never really sure of what it wanted to be - Fate/kaleid knew exactly what it was and never tried to do anything else. It is a magical girl anime through and through and I wouldn't go into this expecting anything more.The story is told in a simple, straight-forward fashion. It doesn’t take itself too seriously. It doesn’t try too...hard to be deep and meaningful. Some may argue that this makes the story is predictable. Yes, we all know how it's going to end - with good guys triumphing over the bad guys - but the part we're all really interested in is the filling of the sandwich, and that’s where the length of the series comes in. 10 episodes has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it is fast paced and there are no fillers. However, on the other hand, it lacks detail in the story. In the case of Fate/kaleid, I think it could’ve done a lot more with just 2-3 more episodes but it finished well and doesn’t leave you expecting more or questioning anything.While the series doesn’t have the same darker, more serious atmosphere that Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero do, the episodes were a good mix of action and comedic moments. The action scenes were well played out and not always entirely predictable.  I found the comedy enjoyable for the most part, but at times the dialogue felt forced. I did enjoy the comedic elements surround the Illya x Yuri ship. There was ample fanservice present for those who are interested but at times it felt extremely tacky and awkward, especially considering the age of the main characters, but if you’re into lolis… well…The first thing I noted about the main characters is that they are all female. Shiro is very much a background character in this. Illya’s cheerful personality made her an enjoyable lead for the series and her naivety added to the comedy. Miyu was a good compliment for Illya; initially a cold and distant high achiever but gradually warms up to Illya. Rin returns as her beloved tsundere self, although her rivalry and constant bickering with Luvia became rather tiresome at times. The Kaleido Sticks are more for comedic relief than anything else.

The colours and backgrounds were gorgeous. The character design wasn’t particularly detailed but the outfits fit the magical girl vibe. I thought the action scenes were particularly well done and on par with something out of Fate/Zero. The motions were fluid and the special effects were appealing. The scenes were really brought to life. A quick search of the animators revealed some of them worked on series such as FMA:B, Shakugan no Shana and Star Driver.I didn’t always notice the background music but I found it perfectly complimented the action scenes and amplified the intensity.

Fate/kaleid. A magical girl spinoff to one of my favorite anime franchises, the Fate franchise. While Fate/kaleid is not the first magical girl spinoff (that award goes to Nanoha, I believe), the Fate franchise is really really popular, and TYPE-MOON seems to have all intention of milking it out for as long as they can. So I came into this show expecting a happy-go-lucky magical girl show that would be little more than fanservice.Boy was I wrong.Fate/kaleid tells the tale of Ilya. Unlike in the original Fate, Ilya has lived a perfectly normal life so...far and is just your typical girl. One day however, a magical girl staff comes crashing through her window when she's taking a bath and forces Ilya to become a magical girl. You see,Cards are messing up the lay lines or something like that, and originally the magic association sent two girls, Rin and Luvia, to capture these cards. However, Rin and Luvia hate each other and argued all the time, so the staffs ran away and picked new partners. And so, Ilya must fight the Heroic Spirits defending these cards alongside fellow magical girl Miyu, with Rin and Luvia helping the both of them out a bit.Listen. Just because Fate/kaleid stars a bunch of fluffy magical girls does not mean it's all light and fun here. Fate/kaleid is more of a drama than a comedy. I'll even call it a deconstruction of the genre. Ilya and friends get hurt often and nearly die more than once. Ilya is forced to face exactly why she wants to become a magical girl and she realizes that's it's not all fluffy like shows on TV. And it deconstructs it perfectly, compared to another magical girl deconstruction (cough) Puella. The drama Ilya goes through feels real, expect one plot point I'll discuss later.And listen. Just because Fate/kaleid stars a bunch of magical girls does not mean that it can be freakin' badass when it wants to be. These battles are just a joy to watch, I'll even put them alongside Fate/Zero's battles, and those are amazing. The animation during these scenes get way better, they play a little epic track that's more or less a wannabe Yuki Kaijura that actually works, and the choreography is amazing. Due to the fact the danger is real this show, there's also a sense of suspension. Sure you know no one's going to die (dark one or not, this is still a magical girl spinoff), but it is still awesome.However, there's the category of the characters. My Rin's still Rin (I always forget how much I love her until I see her in action), and the two new characters, Luvia and Miyu, far nicely. Sure Luvia can be a little annoying at times and Miyu your typical mysterious emotionless transfer student who's perfect at everything but yet has problems making friends, but they're still fine. But Ilya? … Now, when creating spinoffs, an important factor is to keep your characters the same as they were before. Sure they're obviously going to be slightly different, but they still need to have a resemblance of the original in them. This Ilya is no way like the original Ilya however. While it does make sense as without her dark past, Ilya has no reason to become the half-insane “Bah-sah-kah, kill them!” girl we all know and love, I still want a little of that girl in there. However, this Ilya is just your typical magical girl heroine. Nice, a little shy, everyone loves her despite her mistakes... Aka, dull.And then comes the second problem with Fate/kaleid. It can get too dark. Now, I love darkness with a burning passion, but there is a difference between drama and forced drama. You all know the type of episode where the team splits up due to some trivial argument and gets back together at the end? Yeah. Well, Fate/kaleid has a whole arc of that. And it is so badly written. To put it simply, everything just goes bad for Ilya and she more or less loses her confidence she's gained as a magical girl due to the fact one of the characters decides to says she hates her, for a reason that does make sense but is originally done in such a terrible way. She then spends the episodes until the arc is over moping around and being so sad, I almost felt like crying. I mean, if you're going to make Ilya your typical girl, then give her a happy life. Let us see the normal Ilya. However, with the whole darkness of the show, I began to wonder, isn't there just one timeline where Ilya can be happy? This whole arc is horribly done and is pulled out in a way that makes no sense and is ended so easily (hey, at least we get to see a cameo from a Zero character), it almost made me want the happy-go-lucky magical girl spinoff I was expecting over some dark Puella ripoff (okay, the manga did come before Puella, but still).Now, the animation... I hate it. The animation is fine, but these have to be some of the ugliest character designs I have ever seen. It looks terrible. They were obviously trying to go for the overly cute and moe look, but I just cannot look at it. The lips are animated weirdly, all of the colors are so light, the hair and skin seems to glow, the eyes are weird, it just looks terrible. Some of the characters barely look like their original role. While things do look a little better in the gloriously animated action scenes, in the non-action scenes, it's just not pretty. The music, like I mentioned above, is rather awesome, with really epic tunes playing during the battle scenes and more relaxing, happy tunes playing during the non-battle scenes. The voice acting is also nice too. Expected though, considering most of these seiyuu have previous experience in their characters.Despite its flaws however, I just couldn't help but really enjoy Fate/kaleid. It was neat to see all of the characters I love in a new setting. And you don't even have to have any previous experience in the Fate franchise to enjoy this. You'll just miss some of the in-jokes. Fate/kaleid is a fun show, and I give it 8 out of 10 stars, though if it wasn't for the Fate name on it it would probably be 7. TYPE-MOON's plan worked apparently. I recommend this to any TYPE-MOON and magical girl fan. There's also going to be a season 2 coming out this winter, and I am looking forward to it. far and is just your typical girl. One day however, a magical girl staff comes crashing through her window when she's taking a bath and forces Ilya to become a magical girl. You see,Cards are messing up the lay lines or something like that, and originally the magic association sent two girls, Rin and Luvia, to capture these cards. However, Rin and Luvia hate each other and argued all the time, so the staffs ran away and picked new partners.

For me it made things more clear and how this story is related to the original. Actually, the reason I was even interested in this is because I liked the original fate/stay night series (and the trilogy movies). However in them, despite Illya (Illyasviel) being a interesting character, her fate was always the same in the originals. That\'s why I decided to watch this, to get something different.Second important point, quoted literally from the series:""The...most important part of any transformation is the naked fanservice obscured by magical beams of light""You have to be aware of this (fanservice) and it\'ll get worse in the 2nd and 3rd season. I was able to ignore it despite it in my opinion ruining the experience sometimes (they overdid it).Other than that I got what I expected, more or less. Intense battles, some comedy and drama. I never grew tired of Rin and Luvia arguing or fighting each other. most important part of any transformation is the naked fanservice obscured by magical beams of light""You have to be aware of this (fanservice) and it\'ll get worse in the 2nd and 3rd season.

I never grew tired of Rin and Luvia arguing or fighting each other.', ""This review is for all Prisma series that's out at this moment I write the review (1st, 2weiz, 3rei, the movie)-----I’ll be honest here. I’m here for fan service, alright? At least that's what I expect when I'm jumping in.What I think the premise is before watching is what if Holy Grail war never happen and Illya has her normal fun elementary school life and accidentally become magical girl.It suppose to be comedy/light heart/slice of life/fan service. I expect myself to have fun watching and be done with it.Holy hell, I ended up rate this series 10/10 never see that coming. If you’re Fate series...fan and you not completely turn off by fan service and comedy (I rarely know people who completely hate comedy). This is a must-watch. Best magical girl series I’ve watched so far, on par with original Card Captor Sakura (the Sakura Clear card arc is a disappointment compare to the original).Story : 6.5/10 for the 1st. 7/10 for 2weiz. 8/10 for 3rei. 9/10 for Oath under the snow the movie. The score keep going up because there actually a story behind all of the BS they started out as light-heart joking around having fun + nothing make sense but well you didn’t come for story in the first place so who cares? ... and pretty much after start of 3rei story escalate (downwards) real quick and oh boi I didn’t see that coming.Characters : 9/10 Everyone just being themselves, but being way more funny. They really speak their mind that they cannot say in the main series (coz the main series is way more serious tone than this one). In Prisma series there is nothing to hold them back and they really go all out with it. Easter eggs about other Fate series everywhere.Fan service : 11/10. 15/10 if you like Illya from the main series (I do). I do expect mild fan service/eye candy from Illya but holy hell they are not. lol. If you definitely hate fan service then Prisma series is not for you.Comedy : 10/10. All the characters in there has their perk(?) of making jokes in literally every situation. Sarcasm to other magical girls show everywhere. Transformation scene is the most boring part of magical girl show? lol. no. It’s the most hilarious one. Ruby the Magic Stick speak your mind everytime. I swear this magic stick can read the viewers mind. All series specials are a must-watch for comedy aspect.Art/Sound : 9/10 high quality, I guess? I didn’t see obvious problem with it so it should be fine. Fight scenes in this series is somehow better than the main series. No I’m not joking and it come at the most unexpected moment too. More like you didn’t expect comedy series to have a serious fight scenes, right? Hooh, I never be so damn wrong before.Overall/tl;dr; : If you like Fate series and don’t hate comedy/fan service, go watch this one 10/10. +2 points for Ruby the Magic Stick just for her sarcasms.

It's a magical girl anime that's not afraid to go all-in on the yuri and has made itself stand out from the rest of Fate as a result. As a magical girl show, as a yuri loli show, and as a Fate entry, I believe it succeeds at all three with flying colors.So, let me just start by saying that the part of this anime that turns many people away is actually a plus for me, and as such I'll note that if lolis in...semi-revealing outfits making out isn't your thing, well... sucks. You can watch the first season though.Where do I start. The characters? The main three girls, Illya, Miyu, and Kuro, are basically the best things ever. Exaggerating aside they put shows like Wataten to shame in cuteness and comedic potential, much less character development of which there is plenty for all three as they learn to accept their roles and love each other. The character design and artstyle could not be better.The story has its moments but for a lot of it it's mostly held up by it's outstanding characters. This is fine, mind you, but almost the entirety of the first season and 2wei are spent getting Miyu and Kuro into the party, respectively. 3rei and the movie actually take place in multiple timelines, which makes Illya stand out in the Fate lore as probably the only entry to do so linearly. The villains can be very hateable, but when they decide to redeem one it doesn't take me very long to like them.I do not particularly care for Illya's non-magical classmates, though they too have their moments (see: 2wei Herz ep3). As for the slice of life episodes, predictably, I love them. God everyone is just so cute, I love how Bazette is a hobo after her first fight and I especially love how Illya is with Miyu when they're left alone.Gilgamesh as a shota and a good guy is surprisingly entertaining, especially combined with the rest of the cast of 3rei.The movie was nothing like the rest of Illya since it was focused on one of the two Shirous, but it makes up for it by having the best story of any of the seasons and filling in the mystery concerning Miyu that was only partly addressed before.Illya continues what seems to be Fate tradition of mediocre OP's (the only exception to which I've seen so far is Today's Menu). The ED's however, are often quite catchy and get switched out for special versions fairly often. The OST is also really good, though since it does it's job of not being noticed I can't elaborate much more. The Emiya theme plays twice though.Silverlink did great with the animation, I'm not saying it's Ufotable quality but it's closer than you'd expect.Overall, I love Illya mostly because it's adorable, hilarious, and unique, but it's also got super interesting lore to back it up given its place within the broader Fate series and more than competent story. semi-revealing outfits making out isn't your thing, well... sucks.

The urban fantasy aesthetic is what plays into separating Fate from more high fantasy series. The animation is pretty good, and there are some servant-level fights to be enjoyed. Not as spectacular as ufotable but it's fine.The story...is pretty average when it comes to addressing the relationship between Ilya and Miyu.The narrative's strong point is the characterization of Miyu as the stoic, overly logical one, while Ilya is kind of an otaku, more imaginative and impulsive. They're really cute together, and the fan service moments are kind of funny.

It's a wonderful spinoff of Fate/Stay Night, and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something more lighthearted, or if you're a Fate fan and you want to laugh at how backwards everything is in this spinoff world.Be warned, despite Illya being the main character of this anime, her character is waaaay weaker, and you may be disappointed if you're a die hard Illya fan like I am.This anime has average music, but a sick opening and ending.It's your average magical girl situation with the Fate characters you know and love (and then some!)Miyu is best kaleid liner...girl, can't wait to watch season 2 and 3 and hopefully the upcoming movie! girl, can't wait to watch season 2 and 3 and hopefully the upcoming movie!"", ""Recommendation: If you like the Fate series, magical girls, or ideally both, you'll enjoy Prisma Illya.  It's not by any means must watch if that doesn't sound interesting to you though.  You don't need to have seen any other entries in the Fate franchise to watch this one, it's a standalone spinoff.Despite taking place in an alternate magical girl universe, Prisma Illya is very much a Fate series.  Lavishly animated action scenes, a straightforward and unmemorable plot, and a large collection of solid characters is what defines the franchise to me, and Illya is no exception.Overall, it's a fine series that is...hard to say much about.  It doesn't do anything new or unique with the standard magical girl formula, and the plot is equally paint-by-numbers (collect X number of mcguffins, fight a battle each time you find one, rinse, repeat).  Illya and Miyu are your standard magical girl pairing of the positive and bubbly girl with light colored hair and the modest and restrained girl with black hair.  The drama is light and focused around the usual themes of friendship that you'd get from this sort of show.  Aside from the occasional fanservice and a little bit of blood in the action scenes, it wouldn't entirely be out of place as a true kids cartoon.  Adults may find the plot overly simplistic or childish.The girls are good characters, but again, not especially unique or interesting.  If you've seen a magical girl show, you've probably seen near-identical versions of Illya and Miyu before.  Rin and Luvia are more hit or miss.  As someone who likes Rin in other Fate entries, I found her sort of annoying here, but not so much that I disliked her.  Their fighting can be funny but more often it's just exasperating.  At a certain point it's like, I get that they're rivals, you don't have to keep reminding me and demonstrating it multiple times per episode.  The VA work is generally quite good although there are a few I didn't like as much (Ruby's VA in particular sounds like she's delivering her lines from the inside of a well).The action scenes are well animated and can be exciting, but unfortunately they tend to be highly patterned and predictable.  Every single battle plays out the same way, with the girls getting beat up early, then turning the tables and defeating the villain, except they were actually completely unharmed by that last attack when the dust clears, so they beat up the girls some more until it looks like they're about to lose and then the girls pull out some previously unused technique to win instantly when they're at their most desperate.  It takes the drama out of seeing the protagonists in a bad spot when it happens every single time they fight and you know exactly how and when they're going to turn it around without even thinking about it.Overall, a fun but flawed magical series that isn't especially unique or worth going out of your way to see, but it's not bad or anything.  If you're into the concept, you'll probably end up enjoying it, but if magical girls aren't your thing, this isn't going to be the series to change your mind. hard to say much about.

It seamlessly pokes fun at common tropes while telling an engaging narrative through those same means. The primary focus falls on Illya, a normal girl who's dragged from her everyday life into a magical battle. Given her image of magical girls, she initially goes along with these developments to chase an exciting fantasy, but once the threat of death rears its head she's desperate to escape it all. Throughout this journey, Miyu serves as her peer, and also the main point of comparison. In this way, we...learn a significant amount about both characters, with their dynamic bringing the themes of normalcy, fear, and friendship to life.Tonally, the series balances levity and intensity well, never lingering too long on one sentiment or transitioning too quickly from another. Even if you know nothing of Fate, and can't appreciate the humor/depth of having these characters in these roles, you have plenty to look forward to in this self-contained story. And if you are familiar with Fate, you not only get all that, but a fresh take on beloved concepts like Noble Phantasms and the Holy Grail War.

Give Prisma Illya a go!"", 'A huge plot change by the anime adaptation from the original manga:The quality of the animation itself of this season is excellent. I don\'t have much more to add regarding this point. However, there is one huge change that they did to the plot. I believe there could have been reasons for Silver Link to do so at that time, and I will share my guess below. However this change missed a huge point of the original story, and made it less coherent IMO, which is a shame. I will explain what I mean in detail.If you\'re wary of spoilers (I wouldn\'t say this season...in particular has a lot of plot twists though), you may want to proceed after you\'ve finished the season.The final and most major conflict of this season is the fact that Illya left the battlefield to have Miyu battle Berserker alone. The immediate trigger for this, in the anime, was Miyu lecturing Illya at the end of episode 7. However, just going by common sense, it was rather implausible that Miyu would be so harsh on Illya all of a sudden, especially considering that Illya used her ability to essentially save everybody.The explanation in the anime is that, Miyu was able to see how Illya was afraid of the battles, and therefore said those things to drive Illya away and thus to protect her (by the way, please never communicate your intentions in such a convoluted way in real life lol). The later conversations between Illya and Rin (episode 8) and between Illya and Iris (episode 9) are all centered on whether battle was scary for her.However, this premise doesn\'t hold any water under examination. Throughout the season, Illya has been through thick and thin in various battles and was never timid in any of them. Not to mention how valiant she is in the later seasons. From the beginning of the story, she has never been afraid of the battles themselves, and she is a totally capable and responsible ""magical girl"" in this sense.So what was Illya afraid of, exactly? The original manga made it abundantly clear: She was afraid of *her own power*. This makes total sense. For readers of the original FSN, we all know Illya\'s identity. Of course Illya would have a reservoir of magic prowess unparalleled in the world. However, this Illya in the Priya timeline grew up with the very explicit understanding that she is just a normal girl, with nobody telling her the truth (in season 1 yet). Suddenly, she sees herself showing such great capabilities for destruction, not even just once (previously it was vs. Saber Alter). Anybody experiencing the same contrast on themselves would feel confused and totally lost, at least for a while.In the original manga, after her power erupted when fighting Assassin and obliterated him, when everybody still stood there stunned, Illya flew away by herself, scared. Miyu never blamed her for this at all. The fundamental reason why Illya later submitted her resignation to Rin is also this uncertainty about her own power. In the end, the conversation between her and Iris was focused on this topic as well (sure, it also touched upon the friendship aspect). Exactly because Iris told her that, there is no good or bad to one\'s power, that she shouldn\'t be afraid of her power, but should wield it for the sake of things and people she believes in, and stride forward regardless, Illya regained her footing and went to find Miyu in the end. (She even asked Iris explicitly where her power comes from, but Iris played dumb.)You may say that this sounds like some super-hero-story cliche. However, this conflict makes total sense in the context of Priya IMO. Hiroyama drew Priya because he wants to protect Illya, who after her route was cut is arguably the most tragic character in FSN. The Illya in this story is somebody who Kiritsugu and Iris protected with all their might, just so that she is able to live *a normal life*, which is actually more precious than anything else. Therefore, the contrast between ""everyday"" and ""power"" accentuates the theme very well. This also leads nicely to the later developments in the series, where Illya gradually masters her power and takes responsibility to save Miyu as well as the others. On the contrary, the emphasis on the contrast between ""fear of battle itself"" and ""determination to protect friend"" in the anime sounds cliched and stiff.My guess is, Silver Link was afraid that some audience would not have any knowledge of the original FSN, and therefore they might feel confused if there is such an element in the story which went unexplained (it\'s actually explained in the second season anyways). Therefore they decided to delete this element altogether and turned it into a more traditional ""magical girl"" friendship story. However, the eruption of power of Illya is already an indispensable part in the plot of season 1 anyways, and cannot be simply worked around like this.In summary, this part felt a really unnecessary addition, and a flaw in the anime adaptation. Of course, I\'m still really thankful to the high-quality fighting scenes and some additional gags in the anime.

As a concept, it\'s bizarre- like a pitch someone jokingly made while on a break, that transformed into an April fools joke that the staff got far too invested in making a genuinely decent work out of; crafting a chimera of two subjects I adore quite dearly, Fate and Mahou Shoujo. While this initial season isn\'t anything spectacular, like much of what I have come to expect out of the Fate franchise, I won\'t act like it did surpass the rather ambiguous expectations I had going into it. As a work itself, knowledge about...it is predicated on having a relative familiarity with UBW, which isn\'t terribly surprising but after seeing episode 6 (which is also what I would call a turning point for the series) I was far more eager to continue watching, especially since it began to introduce more, and lean into it\'s parent work more (while adapting those original ideas into it\'s own spin off work). While I wouldn\'t say this season wasn\'t engaging before this point, as I was enjoying the time I spent with it, I had become far keener to see where this series was going to take me.So, onto the more explicit review/discussion on the series:The bones of this story are (obviously) built off the DNA of Fate/Stay Night, so all of the characters (barring newly introduced ones), like the servants and out leading protagonist Illya Von Einsbern are ones we already know, but since this show has now focused on Illya it gives a fairly entertaining lens on the series perspective from a character that (insofar as the anime adaptations of Fate/Stay) are concerned is quite fresh, and very entertaining. It feels very obviously like a ""Post Madoka Magica"" Mahou Shoujou work, and while still being fairly light hearted, there are moments that it very badly wants to be a darker work- but I don\'t know if it had the confidence to take those kind of steps into the realm of edge just quite yet, but within it\'s following seasons I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s the path it takes. It\'s overall story is nothing quite so bold or extravagant, and I would describe it as endearing and entertaining but not a whole lot more than that, as the story itself doesn\'t demand much of the viewer. It\'s an establishing work that needs to be built upon, and can\'t be wholly critiqued outside of what it is in this initial state. In the ladder portion of the season it does lean into this edgier, slightly darker dynamic while still being overwhelmingly balanced out by it\'s lighthearted elements, but the seeds are there.So, this leaves us with the establishment of the characters and how they interact within the work itself; which I think does a perfectly adequate job. While Rin and Luvias back and forth can be fairly annoying, as it only feels like it\'s a rehashing of long-withstanding tropes, they are far from unbearable- especially since they are far more secondary to the dynamic of Miyu and Illya, which initially is the generic ""you do not have a reason to fight like I do, so I will act coldly until you crack the ice in my heart with you warmth"" trope (I\'m not sure exactly what it\'s called but you know what I\'m talking about) and it\'s good fun to watch, especially since it doesn\'t drag. They very quickly begin to cooperate and develop a friendship that makes for entertaining writing, up until the ladder half of the work. Miyus anger towards Ilya is a frustrating sight, not because it\'s undeserved but it feels like it\'s trying to force the story into pa specific manner instead of displaying it a manner that feels genuine. Miyu and Ilya are both children, so lets explicate Miyu a little bit. She\'s clearly meant to be the overly intelligent archetype of character, who believes they are capable of undertaking whatever needs to be done by themselves, thus pushing away those who attempt to get near to them due to their believed superiority that functions as a mask for their insecurities. I don\'t *dislike* this archetype of character, but like, she\'s meant to be an elementary schooler while embodying this archetype leading to this sort of forced dynamic between the two that needs to exist for the sake of the work. I\'m not going to be overly critical of it until I see how it plays out through the end of the series (as I had mentioned beforehand, trying to review a fraction of a multi-season work doesn\'t allow for a complete understanding of the works breadth), but for what it is, it\'s *Not bad*.Onto the things I\'m far less knowledgeable about, animation, music and the general sound (shit like sound effects, and voice acting).The VA performance was very good all the way through, with Ilya and Rin have their respective VA\'s reprising their roles for this work, and always bringing forth their quality work, but that\'s not to scoff at the remainder of the talent who worked on this. I don\'t really have *too* much to say about it, outside of the writing for these characters, and the directing done for their voice work was just great. Their performances were easily one of the standout elements of the work, with how easily they fit into their characters and conveyed believable characters.Animation wise, it was good! It never felt under-animated, or like it was intentionally limiting it\'s animation talent; many of whome worked on highly acclaimed workslike the Mono franchise, The Bebop movie, some Gundam here and there, etc. and those are just the artists directly credited and linked to the work on MAL. These artists have a fantastic understanding of tone, and mood for settings (which I could probably accredit a lot of my enjoyment to, and especially the background art done). The animation itself, in high action scenes was also really enjoyable, with episode 6 being the most observable highlight. The CG work for Ruby and Sapphire was always consistently good, conveying emotions and expression for emoteless beings was done really well. Same with the general animation, character movements never felt stilted, always having a nice flow to them, and it\'s indicative of the unknowable effort that went into this work, for what (from all expectations of the pitch/concept alone) would\'ve stayed on the cutting room floor.Keleid Liner Prisma Illya was a work of passion that brought this silly series to life, and it\'s left me reasonably excited to see the remainder of the work. Even if it\'s an inherently goofy offshoot of the Fate series, it\'s entranced me with it\'s potential for being something very entertaining. it is predicated on having a relative familiarity with UBW, which isn\'t terribly surprising but after seeing episode 6 (which is also what I would call a turning point for the series) I was far more eager to continue watching, especially since it began to introduce more, and lean into it\'s parent work more (while adapting those original ideas into it\'s own spin off work).

But looking at the story at a technical perspective, there’s not much to it. It’s just about Illya going around hunting for the Class cards. There are no subtle, interweaving plot points. It is very direct -- well, at least in the first four or five episodes. The story does...have its turns, and this is obvious in the second half of the series. I like how the second half has given room to add emotion to the plot. At this point, it is not just about Illya defeating one Class card to the next monotonously. The characters have also opened for character development.Speaking of the characters, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya has interesting ones. They’re not complicated enough to deserve complex psychological analyses and such, but they are very fun characters with little conflicts in their heads to keep things interesting enough. A good example of this is Miyu, and how she cannot fly because she is too theoretical and lacking in imagination. This has been contradicted to Illya’s imaginative personality, which makes it quite easy for her to use magic. Rin, Luvia, and the talking Kaleidosticks are also very interesting. Their interactions and conflicts are nothing complicated and deep, but they sure are entertaining to see.The music is nothing special, but it does deliver in communicating the emotions that the scenes require. As for the animation, there are certain sequences that look marvellous, particularly in the fighting sequences, but nothing too fancy that you could call groundbreaking -- just enough to deliver.This anime is very entertaining, even though the plotline doesn’t have that much threads to weave. The genuinely comedic dialogue and actions help to counterbalance this flaw. However, I admit that there are more other flaws in the plot. There are instances that seem to be too random that they felt like a cop-out, like how Illya suddenly transforms into Archer and uses Excalibur. But that’s alright, I wasn’t expecting a complicated story anyway. The fact that I see the Fate characters once again, even though not in the way they were in the original series, is a joy in itself.But there are subtle hints in the ending that the Fate/Stay Night characters are not just the only characters that I’ll see in the next season. It appears that characters from Fate/Zero will be featured as well. I could be wrong, but I hope I’m not. Overall, I really enjoyed Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya.

Very generic collectathon magical girl stuff. The actual writing is all over the place; some scenes come out of nowhere, some feel like they have an incomplete setup, and some are honestly genuinely great. It's a very mixed bag. The beginning of the show is probably the worst of it, and where a lot of the fanservice rears its ugly head, but the middle of the show (especially the fight...against Saber) is pretty good. The ending is okay too, but MAN does the fanservice just really take away any emotional weight some of these scenes have. Example, Irisviel's introduction starting off with a showcase of a nude Illya, going immediately into a closeup of her groping her daughter, then going into a genuinely nice scene of Illya confiding in her mom and talking about her thoughts on her friend and herself is a really weird tonal dissonance, especially for a character who just kinda.... showed up at the very end.It just felt like the show cared more about getting those shots in than it did actually focusing on making a cohesive and interesting narrative. Miyu constantly feels like a nothing character until, like, the very end of the show. Any character building opportunities felt squandered, and the one episode that felt like her moment in the sun was taken up by her playing maid with Illya (her maid outfit later being taken off because of course), then going complete 180 and telling Illya she doesn't wanna work with her any more because she keeps messing everything up (as far as I remember, she didn't mess anything up and, in fact, saved Miyu's ass in the Saber fight (of which Miyu took credit for)). Illya's motivations aren't super clear, the plot itself isn't even really clear as to why anybody is even doing anything, everything just kinda happens. It's meh. 10 episodes is a weird length for a show, and that constrained schedule might've been the issue, but as it stands it's meh.Animation is alright, some poor CGI here and there but nothing too distracting. Fight scenes could've gotten more polish, they feel a bit too snappy and floaty simultaneously but were overall fine. Nothing to write home about. Soundtrack's good, though.Overall, forgettable. If you like loli fanservice, it could be your thing (it would distract from the poor writing), but if you don't, skip it. against Saber) is pretty good.

It's meh. 10 episodes is a weird length for a show, and that constrained schedule might've been the issue, but as it stands it's meh.Animation is alright, some poor CGI here and there but nothing too distracting. Fight scenes could've gotten more polish, they feel a bit too snappy and floaty simultaneously but were overall fine. Nothing to write home about. Soundtrack's good, though.Overall, forgettable.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have?

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama.

In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that.

She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything.

They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2."", 'Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is one of those anime series where people may tends to look away just because for what it is. You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience.

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t. You’ll be a lot happier that way. went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode.

The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t. You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything. We have no idea about the extent of the magicians' powers in this fictional world. We have no idea what this mysterious organization named 'Clock Tower' is all about. We have no idea what these magical sticks actually are and why they abandoned their original owners at the drop of a hat.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

It has stonks of humor but also everything needed to make you feel close to the main characters and possibly tear...up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem. That comes in later seasons.If I was to just judge this based on how good the anime is, putting aside all lore, it's brilliant. It's a touching story (no pun intended, again, next seasons) of fates intertwining. You can watch it with no worries, there's only some controversy in literally the first episode which is more slapstick comedy that actually makes sense than anything else. up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem.

Ended up liking the entire Fate series as well. Heh, worth it.There are reasons why I want to watch this so bad. The reasons include :- Yuri- Magical Girl- CutenessBelieve it or not. This show has all of them! I’m not kidding. All of them. The yuri scenes are hot fire just like the ones I saw on XVIDEOS and Pornhub. There clearly is a magical girl. And everything is just moe moe. I couldn’t ask for more, lmao....This is what you call a masterpiece for degenerates. Absolutely top-tier.[SPOILER REVIEW] ( An Additional )[NOTE] : The spoiler-free review is above. Why bother reading this part if you haven’t even finished these followings -  Fate/Zero, Fate Stay/Night : Unlimited Blade Works, Fate Stay/Night, Fate Stay/Night : Heaven’s Feel ( Until II ).If you didn’t finish the ones listed above then I advise you to scram. Otherwise prepare for a barrage of spoilers.So you know how the Fate series treated Illya as if she’s destined to be harrassed. Yeah right. We all know how sad it was when she got destroyed. Twice!Well if you felt sad for illya then Prisma illya would be your depression curer. Since Prisma illya is pretty much her series. We get to spend time with her 24/7 and see her kiss and grope other lolis. Oh yeah. Thank you, Fate series. This shit is what I needed after seeing her dying multiples of times.A bit irrelevant but I haven’t jacked off for weeks. Thanks to this, my long lost routine has returned.

Arigatou Gozaimasu~ ( sorry if I spelt that wrong I’m sleepy )', ""Quick Review.Story:Decent story derived from Fate/ series. Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2. Have withstood magical girls and their self aware banter.Yet, those viewers only care about the yuri scenes.So as I pray...

While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2."", 'Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is one of those anime series where people may tends to look away just because for what it is. You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have?

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is.', 'Do you like loli?Do you like spin-off anime of excellent series that have nothing to do with said excellent series?Do you like a show that can’t decide what the hell it wants to be?Then sit down and watch Fate/Kaleid, a ten episode anime that is full of everything you love about Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night, such as hilarious comedy, underaged lesbians, and magical girls. You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10', ""Few animes had the impact, drama and downright manliness of Fate/Zero, a Type-Moon production that blew away all my expectations for an anime. With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10"", ""As you might have seen in the summary for this anime is that it is a spin off set in an alternate reality which illya and her parents are a family and Shiro is her cousin who frequently visits to check up on her as well as cook and do some house work.  the series also has other characters from the fate series such as Tohsaka Rin and the epic heroes from both fate/stay night and fate/zero.Now on with the review.StoryWhat makes this different from other magical girl series is that there is no mascot animal that goes around and recruits female heroes....Instead, the magical wand who has a mind of its own with human personality and everything goes around to find the most suitable candidate to become a magical girl. After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

It has stonks of humor but also everything needed to make you feel close to the main characters and possibly tear...up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem.

Ended up liking the entire Fate series as well. Heh, worth it.There are reasons why I want to watch this so bad. The reasons include :- Yuri- Magical Girl- CutenessBelieve it or not. This show has all of them! I’m not kidding. All of them. The yuri scenes are hot fire just like the ones I saw on XVIDEOS and Pornhub. There clearly is a magical girl. And everything is just moe moe.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG.', ""I am the bone of my spin offs.Yuri is my body, moe is my blood.I have resulted in over a thousand boners.Known to lolicons.But not to you filthy casuals....Have withstood magical girls and their self aware banter.Yet, those viewers only care about the yuri scenes.So as I pray... UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have?

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama.

In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that.

She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything.

They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2."", 'Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is one of those anime series where people may tends to look away just because for what it is. You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience.

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t. You’ll be a lot happier that way. went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode.

The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t. You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything. We have no idea about the extent of the magicians' powers in this fictional world. We have no idea what this mysterious organization named 'Clock Tower' is all about. We have no idea what these magical sticks actually are and why they abandoned their original owners at the drop of a hat.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

It has stonks of humor but also everything needed to make you feel close to the main characters and possibly tear...up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem. That comes in later seasons.If I was to just judge this based on how good the anime is, putting aside all lore, it's brilliant. It's a touching story (no pun intended, again, next seasons) of fates intertwining. You can watch it with no worries, there's only some controversy in literally the first episode which is more slapstick comedy that actually makes sense than anything else. up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem.

Ended up liking the entire Fate series as well. Heh, worth it.There are reasons why I want to watch this so bad. The reasons include :- Yuri- Magical Girl- CutenessBelieve it or not. This show has all of them! I’m not kidding. All of them. The yuri scenes are hot fire just like the ones I saw on XVIDEOS and Pornhub. There clearly is a magical girl. And everything is just moe moe. I couldn’t ask for more, lmao....This is what you call a masterpiece for degenerates. Absolutely top-tier.[SPOILER REVIEW] ( An Additional )[NOTE] : The spoiler-free review is above. Why bother reading this part if you haven’t even finished these followings -  Fate/Zero, Fate Stay/Night : Unlimited Blade Works, Fate Stay/Night, Fate Stay/Night : Heaven’s Feel ( Until II ).If you didn’t finish the ones listed above then I advise you to scram. Otherwise prepare for a barrage of spoilers.So you know how the Fate series treated Illya as if she’s destined to be harrassed. Yeah right. We all know how sad it was when she got destroyed. Twice!Well if you felt sad for illya then Prisma illya would be your depression curer. Since Prisma illya is pretty much her series. We get to spend time with her 24/7 and see her kiss and grope other lolis. Oh yeah. Thank you, Fate series. This shit is what I needed after seeing her dying multiples of times.A bit irrelevant but I haven’t jacked off for weeks. Thanks to this, my long lost routine has returned.

Arigatou Gozaimasu~ ( sorry if I spelt that wrong I’m sleepy )', ""Quick Review.Story:Decent story derived from Fate/ series. Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2. Have withstood magical girls and their self aware banter.Yet, those viewers only care about the yuri scenes.So as I pray...

While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2."", 'Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is one of those anime series where people may tends to look away just because for what it is. You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have?

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is.', 'Do you like loli?Do you like spin-off anime of excellent series that have nothing to do with said excellent series?Do you like a show that can’t decide what the hell it wants to be?Then sit down and watch Fate/Kaleid, a ten episode anime that is full of everything you love about Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night, such as hilarious comedy, underaged lesbians, and magical girls. You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10', ""Few animes had the impact, drama and downright manliness of Fate/Zero, a Type-Moon production that blew away all my expectations for an anime. With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10"", ""As you might have seen in the summary for this anime is that it is a spin off set in an alternate reality which illya and her parents are a family and Shiro is her cousin who frequently visits to check up on her as well as cook and do some house work.  the series also has other characters from the fate series such as Tohsaka Rin and the epic heroes from both fate/stay night and fate/zero.Now on with the review.StoryWhat makes this different from other magical girl series is that there is no mascot animal that goes around and recruits female heroes....Instead, the magical wand who has a mind of its own with human personality and everything goes around to find the most suitable candidate to become a magical girl. After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

It has stonks of humor but also everything needed to make you feel close to the main characters and possibly tear...up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem.

Ended up liking the entire Fate series as well. Heh, worth it.There are reasons why I want to watch this so bad. The reasons include :- Yuri- Magical Girl- CutenessBelieve it or not. This show has all of them! I’m not kidding. All of them. The yuri scenes are hot fire just like the ones I saw on XVIDEOS and Pornhub. There clearly is a magical girl. And everything is just moe moe.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG.', ""I am the bone of my spin offs.Yuri is my body, moe is my blood.I have resulted in over a thousand boners.Known to lolicons.But not to you filthy casuals....Have withstood magical girls and their self aware banter.Yet, those viewers only care about the yuri scenes.So as I pray... UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have?

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama.

In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t.

You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that.

She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything.

They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.

UNLIMITED LOLI TWERKS!Fate/kaleid, the somewhat self aware, somewhat deconstructing, and fully bonerific and moeblob magical girl show, also known as Carnival Phantasm with only Fate characters and with... magical girls. I found this show to actually be more entertaining than Fate/Stay Night UBW, for even though it is as stupid and over the top as UBW, if not more so, at least it's painfully aware. It's also... not for kids... that's for sure. Just like how Madoka Magica isn't for kids due to the darkness and dankness, Fate/kaleid isn't for kids because... there are jokes that you wouldn't associate with a kids show.Oh, you thought that scene was just gonna be cute girls doing cute things, with their cute voices and their cute interactions? Too bad, here's a boner joke. You thought one of the cute lolis visiting their sick loli friend was heartwarming? Too bad, let's have one of the lolis try to sexually assault the other.Fate/kaleid is bad, but it's so funny that it's good. The story itself is basically like every magical girl ever made, trying to capture the cards! If only Sakura Matou was a magical girl. CLAMP would probably sue Type Moon...Fate/kaleid does, to some degree, deconstruct the magical girl genre. While it is nowhere near the depressing realization in YuYuYu, or the dark twist in Madoka Magica, it still deconstructs the expectations of what a magical girl is supposed to be. Whether it be through self aware magical girl jokes, or through character expectations of what being a magical girl is like, let's just say that this show isn't entirely rainbows and unicorns and yuri lolis.Fate/kaleid is one of those shows where you should probably watch the rest of the Fate franchise to get the full experience. While this show does take place in a completely different setting, there are a lot of references to the Fate universe we all know and love. The concepts of classes and Noble Phantasms are still a thing, and to fully get the grasp of the situation, go watch the other shows first! You don't have to, but I recommend it.And of course, there is the budget, the most famous aspect of the Fate series. Fate/kaleid is a spin off, and it isn't even by Ufotable, so how are the action scenes? Surprisingly, the action scenes are still incredibly high quality. Great choreography and special effects that can hold its own against Ufotable, Fate/kaleid has quite the thrilling battles. Fate/kaleid also has a very good soundtrack, as well as a catchy Fate-esque OP. The voice actresses for the lolis are just HHNNNGGGGGGG and yeah. Long story short, Fate/kaleid still boasts some surprisingly high production values.And of course, the characters! The Fate characters are back, albeit with somewhat different personalities. Illya is a deredere moeblob loli who is actually an incredible comedic character, and she's got a maid fetish! What a gal. Miyu is a Fate/kaleid exclusive kuudere anti-social character who is... pretty generic, but hey, she's also a loli! And of course, you will find many of your favorite Fate characters back in action. TsundeRin is back in business, this time stealing the Cardcaptor Sakura position from her sister to become Illya's mentor, and you got Luvia, who you thought was going to be a Fate/kaleid exclusive, but spoiler alert, she isn't!! You will also see other familiar faces in the supporting cast, such as SHIROU THE HERO, back at being the good oni chan that he is. He doesn't say any stupid quotes in this season, but I heard he does later on, so looking forward to that. You got Iris, who is now a total milf, and her personality hasn't changed at all since Zero. There is even a personal favorite of mine, Fuji-nee, the best sensei ever! Also, the two magical sticks, Ruby and Sapphire, have A LOT of character! Don't take their stick appearance for granted! They have way more character than most modern anime characters these days.Fate/kaleid is just even more fanservice for Fate fans. As someone who isn't a big Type Moon fan, I still found this spin off highly enjoyable. The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2.

The fact that I enjoyed a magical girl spin off more than half the canon story line is... impressive, to say the least.TL;DR: I hope there is more yuri in season 2."", 'Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is one of those anime series where people may tends to look away just because for what it is. You know that saying that goes “don\'t judge a book by its cover?” Well, I guess some anime fans seems to do just the opposite of that and take the cover for granted. This is one of those anime series that might bring some disappointment at first especially to those loyal fans of the Type-Moon franchise. Series like Fate/Stay Night, Garden of Sinners, and a more recent example of Fate/Zero has a stance of that serious atmosphere going on. What does Fate/kaleid liner...Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience. Oh and let\'s not forget there\'s still an OVA as well as specials.The action is surprisingly fluid and presented quite well. I was surprised after seeing how this was adapted because of the amount of detail put into the actual fighting. The enemies are designed with a typical Type-Moon fashion but given a more dangerous look than fans might originally anticipate. In fact, a particular enemy that shows itself might bring out some shock to see how the character is presented differently in this series. The more important part though is that the action isn\'t parodied but rather as being serious. Illya\'s struggle at first shows her inexperience but there\'s development with her skills that is clearly evidenced later on. As for Miya, she shows her experience already as a magical girl but more importantly becomes both a friend and rival for Illya. As a foil to her character, the duo makes a formidable team along with those magical sticks.As far as jokes goes though, I have to admit that some of it is a bit stale. Oh and the series doesn\'t try to avoid its fan service. There\'s the suggestive camera angles and skin being shown along with the loli expressions here and there. Some of the conversations between the girls and their peers also seems to be a bit forced in the comedy department. Even the first episode shows a bit of this along with cheesy dialogues. Among other factors, Shiro also doesn\'t seem to be an impressive character as his role is more of in the backgrounds. His denseness regarding his female friends and her own foster sister is also a bit frustrating to watch. By the way, he isn\'t even a main character. There\'s also some lewd jokes and misunderstandings here and there as well which should be expected.The artwork isn\'t as impressive as I had hoped. Most of the coloring has a light tone but is covered with generic design. As mentioned before, Illya and Miyu are designed as magical girls and they really look like them. Their enemies are designed to give off a dangerous vibe although sometimes, I wonder what their real purpose is. The backgrounds are typical with a less-so realistic feeling to it. In fact, there\'s hardly any realism in this show. On the other hand, I do find that everything does fits within the concept of the series quite well, at least that much.Color me surprised here but the OST is brilliant. Sound production met beyond my expectations especially in the action scenes. A particular battle in the later episodes gives off its intensity with the way it is presented. It has a balance of rock and techno that is pleasurable to hear. The OP song ""starlog"" by ChouCho also shows its strength with its choreography and some foreshadowing. Among the cast though, Mai Kadowaki gets a standing ovation for her performance. Returning as her role from Fate/Stay Night, the way her character stands out requires a more high pitch tone. I am quite grateful that she was able to pull the task off with brilliance.Overall, don\'t entirely judge this series by its cover. Sure, it looks like just a typical magical girls series with cute girls doing cute things. But then when you look deeper into it, you might get a surprise. That surprise comes from the way it is both adapted and presented. I feel sorry for those who dropped this series from the first episode without giving it another shot. If you\'re a fan of Type-Moon\'s franchise, this should definitely be something to invest time into. Even if you\'re not fan of Illya, Rin, Shiro, or the others, it should be at least given a try for the first 3 episodes. Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls. Prisma☆Illya have? More than what you hoped for.At any rate, this series is adapted from the manga of the same name written by Hiroshi Hinoyama. An important note is that the series takes place in an alternate set universe that serves as a spinoff of Fate/Stay Night. Therefore, do not be surprised if there are some familiar characters making their spotlights in this series.As far as this series goes, the premise is pretty straight forward. Illyasviel von Einzbern is indeed the main protagonist of the story. (for the sake of my laziness and ease, she will be referred to as \'Illya\') For those who are unfamiliar with her from the Type-Moon franchise, she is foster sister of Shiro. However, there is a difference between her character and Fate/Stay Night. In this series, she is shown as a cheerful young girl who grows up in a seemingly normal childhood with friends and joy. Oh but that all changes one day when she makes a contract and becomes a magical girl. Welcome to your new life, Illya.Even before becoming a magical girl, we can see that Illya is already fascinated with the idea because of a popular anime she watches. In that anime, there are magical girls. But never did she ever thought the day she would actually become one herself. For fans of Illya from the original series, this would be a delight because we get to see her in a much different way. But for fans of the Type-Moon franchise itself, you might also get a surprise with the addition of some new characters. Oh and Rin makes her return too of course in this series with her tomboyish self.As some fans might guess, this series does have a lot of fan service and some tasteless moments. These usually involves awkward moments mostly from Illya because of her naive personality. Furthermore, her character is designed with extra doses of moe. Illya\'s battle design stands out that also gives her a touch of magical girl atmosphere. In fact, she herself admits the outfit to be embarrassing. On the other hand, we have Miyu Edelfelt, a new character that also serves the serious role of a magical girl. Unlike Illya though, she seems to be much more serious and quite mature for someone her age. With both magical and academic talent, Miyu serves as a character that seemingly exists the opposite of Illya. She is like the perfect candidate for a magical girl while Illya lags behind as the second rate. Or does she....?With the help of a talking magical kaleidostick (Magical Ruby), maybe Illya can overcome her lack of self-confidence. After the contract is being made though, the magical stick plays the role of more of a mentor. Of course, themes such as becoming a magical girl, training to gain experience, and fighting/capturing cards isn\'t new to the anime industry. About a decade ago, a popular classic known as Cardcaptor Sakura also adapts the theme of a normal girl whose one day\'s life changes forever after becoming a magical girl. Other series with similar themes such as Shugo Chara, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, PMMM, and the more recent Gen\'ei o Kakeru Taiyō  also shares similarities. The noticeable phase here is that Fate kaleid liner Prisma Illya plays around the idea constantly in both a cute and dangerous fashion.If I had to use the word \'cute\', this series would earn a 10/10 on that scale. But more than that though, the concept of collecting cards as a magical girl is indeed a serious role. There\'s no joking around because the enemies Illya and her friends face are dangerous. In fact, even around half way into the series, the girls\' lives are put into danger when they face adversaries like they\'ve never encountered before. Classic enemies from the Type-Moon franchise makes their appearances in alternate versions to present a challenge that really does put their lives in danger. In a series such as this, you might not take it serious at first. However, it is clear that the idea of collecting cards is a grim task at hand. On the comedy side, there\'s the love/hate rivalry between Rin and Luvia. Illya\'s behavior also might spawn a few face palm worthy moments because of her age and inexperience.10 episodes. That\'s less than the average amount of a typical one core series. What that means is that the series may have to cut down some material or it won\'t have time to fit everything in. Luckily, the series is faithful with its adaptation. The only slight problem might be that the series doesn\'t have enough time to cover all the captures\' every detail. This serves a double edge sword in a way. On one stance, 10 episodes could be rushed and leave out material fans want to see. But then again, the more detailed quality can bring out a more pleasurable experience.

Oh and there\'s nothing wrong with watching cute girly cartoons with magical girls.', 'Fate/Kaleid is something that happens when you take a seemingly stupid idea and turn it into something that\'s close to spectacular.Now, before I get started, I just want to point something out; A lot of people disliked this series, or dropped it in the first few episodes because it\'s a Fate/ series... turned Magical Girl. I did the same. When it was first airing, I dropped it, not because I didn\'t think it was interesting, I just didn\'t feel like watching it at the time. I, too, think that turning the Fate/ series into a Magical Girl series is a, well, stupid idea. I...was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes. It\'s like Madoka Magica\'s rating, though I find that this series is more mature in terms of content than that series is.I love the Fate/ series, I love Fate/Zero and I love Fate/Stay Night. Now note that I have JUST finished this series, as in, I watched it after the announcements for a Fate/Stay Night remake by ufotable and a season 2 for Fate/Kaleid were made. Due to the Fate/Stay Night remake being announced, I saw this series more as an awesome bonus. It takes the Fate/ story line and looks at it through a different light; although a fairly obnoxious and/or ridiculous one, it has a lot more to offer than it seems. Also note that this series has NOTHING to do with the main Fate/ storyline, character relationships are different, the Holy Grail War doesn\'t exist as far as we know, and characters who are supposed to be dead, are now alive.Now I\'ll start my actual review, and it may seem like I\'m over-praising the series... if it does, I apologize because that was not my intention. This is my actual opinion. I watched this series with a perspective as it being a bonus series to add onto the already-amazing Fate/ universe, thus I won\'t judge it just because it\'s a ""dumb"" magical girl adaption of the Fate/ series like most people have.Story: 8The story is simple. Illyasviel Einsbern lives a normal Elementary-School life with her friends, and her ""older brother"" Shirou Emiya. Rin Tohsaka and a woman named Luvia were given the job of finding the remaining Class Cards, as they already own the Lancer and the Archer. The class cards reflect the 7 servant classes in the Fate/ series; Archer, Lancer, Saber, Rider, Assassin, Caster and Berserker. These cards are obtainable by entering a mirrored version of certain areas, (As in, another dimension) and fighting the ""Alter"", or the Dark versions of each servant. They use weapons that look like Magical Girl wands, each with a name, Ruby and Sapphire. They both talk and have personalities, too. These two wands believe they\'re abused by Rin and Luvia, so they decide to find new masters. Ruby flies off while Illya is taking a bath and happens to meet her. She then tricks Illya into a ""contract"" with her to become her new master. (Note: This is NOT a contract similar to Madoka Magica whereas she\'s forced to fight or else she\'ll die or something horrible will happen. It\'s just a contract to give her the title of master and to be able to use the wand\'s powers, that\'s all. She doesn\'t HAVE to fight and Ruby fully understands that.) Rin finds Illya, and tells her that since she stole her wand, she\'ll have to help her collect the class cards. Luvia does the same with a girl named Miyu. Thus begins their story.Since the story is simple, it\'s  portrayed/paced perfectly fine. There isn\'t much to explain, so it doesn\'t waste any time. Although, there are some fanservice-ish moments included, but that\'s to be expected of Silver Link\'s animations. They don\'t last long enough to really be a bother. The story becomes dark around episode 6 of the series, as Illya and Miyu go to collect the Caster card, an unexpected servant arrives causing trouble. The series delves into the horror and grief involved with being an elementary school girl and having to fight dark, demonic entities with a magic wand dressed as a magical girl. Illya shows true signs of terror, she realizes that, after she\'s cut and begins to bleed, that all of this is real, that she can actually be killed within these dimensions. Thus, she\'s psychologically unstable for certain amounts of time, and even refuses to talk to her friends when the time comes. The impact of her fighting really shows in her character development. Guilt from accidental attacks that could have injured her own friends is also an element, that you\'d have to see to know what I mean. It does an alright job emotionally, and the dimensions are portrayed spectacularly.To be honest, one of my favorite aspects of the story was the Dark versions of the servants. I have to say, Dark/Alter Saber is one of the most badass characters I have ever seen. She is brutal.There is one thing that isn\'t really explained, unless you\'re a fan of the Fate/ series and you know the background behind Illya, and that\'s the source of her powers. That may or may not be explained in season 2, which I heard from someone that the story will only get darker.Art: 10What can I say? This is Silver Link, their animations have always been fantastic. Look at shows like Dusk Maiden, who\'s visuals are gorgeous. Also, compared to other anime these days, the fight scenes were top-grade. Actually, one of my new favorite anime fights of all time come directly from this series, and that\'s the fight with Alter Saber. You\'ll see what I mean. It\'s a stunning sight to see, and certainly came as a surprise. The art keeps the show suspenseful and intense. I\'m hoping season 2 will be even better, I expect no less from Silver Link.Sound: 10The music is phenomenal. It keeps fight scenes and other emotional scenes intense or it causes them to leave more of an impact. The soundtrack actually sounds like Fate/ music as well, which is a huge plus. I believe it even kept close to the original main theme of Fate/... but it\'s been so long since I\'ve seen Fate/Stay Night I can\'t say for sure. The opening, too, is amazing. Great song, and great visuals to go along with it. The ending I didn\'t really care for because it was somewhat light-hearted and I wanted to see more, so I skipped the credits.Character: 8The characters are... they\'re alright. Nothing really worth mentioning. Ruby and Sapphire, the wands, have their own personalities which keep the show a little more lively considering their attitudes. Illya is, well, different. Nothing really worth describing. One of her friends at school, though, was entertaining even though she didn\'t have a lot of screentime. She was obnoxious and clueless but in a good, funny way. Other than that, the characters are fairly average but you can get attached if you weren\'t already from the previous Fate/ series.Enjoyment: 10This series was interesting. An extension to the Fate/ universe, and a very satisfying one at that. Especially considering there\'s going to be more, I\'m even more pumped and happy that I saw this. It\'s underrated and misunderstood. Don\'t take it as an extension to the Fate/ story directly but an additional bonus to the universe. That way, it\'ll be more enjoyable. Watch it for what it is, don\'t watch it as a Fate/ series, in terms of the Holy Grail War.Overall: 9I can\'t wait for the second season. Give the show a try, I promise it\'ll be a lot better than what it seems to be, especially if you don\'t compare it to anything and just watch it as it is. was wrong.Also, this series is a lot darker than it seems, so do not judge a book by it\'s cover, including a fair amount of blood and suggestive themes.

You know, the kind of things fans asked for after watching the main series.If you are a fan of the series, I’m sure you’re going to pass Kaleid up based upon the fact it is a cutesy magical girl anime. I...went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode. I was already debating how a show based on a series that’s pretty adult in tone could appeal to little girls. I went into the series assuming I was going to see a little girl anime. Twenty-seven minutes later, I walked away wondering just who the hell Kaleid was made for. And after ten episodes and the five DVD specials, I’m still scratching my head.Kaleid is about Illyasviel, a young girl who lives in Japan with some adopted family while her mother and father are out doing…whatever. She watches magical girl anime and dreams of becoming one. Luckily, a magical wand/stick/what-have-you hears her and takes her as its master, making her dream come true. But the wand used to belong to Rin Tohsaka, a tsundere who, along with her partner, lost their wands because all they did was fight with each other. The teenaged girls were tasked with collecting seven cards by the Mage’s Guild if they wanted to be taken under the wing of a master magus. So, through the series, the duo of teenagers use a duo of ten year olds to attain their goals.Sounds like it could a kids show, right? Nope! One episode and there’s a gag about penis’s! A few episodes in and the violence is a little more intense than a kids show usually is.And then the realization:Oh God…this show is supposed to appeal to people my age.Okay, loli porn aside, I can’t fault the series for having Rin Tohsaka. Because seriously, I watched this for Rin. She’s one of the best damn tsundere’s in anime. Her companion, Luvia, whom she always fights with, is less exciting. Exceptionally less exciting. She’s the rich bitch stereotype. She has that “OH HO HO HO HO” laugh and makes fun of Rin for being poor.Illya is a decent character but her development can be filed under “Basic Hero”. Wishful thinking to “No, I don’t want this” to acceptance to throwing aside her weapons after something bad happens to taking them back when she realizes she’s the hero the city deserves.Miyu is another stereotype. Quiet and badass entrance to nothing-to-do-with-hero attitude to learning friendship and working together is a good thing to hurting the hero to finally realizing friendship is magic.Another gripe, the biggest gripe. What the hell is it? Magical girl, fan service, comedy? It does all three pretty decently, but the problem with the series becomes tonal shifts so fast you’ll get whiplash. One episode will spend half the time making tit jokes and focusing on side characters that have absolutely nothing to do with anything, while the other half will be an intense fight. It has Sword Art Online syndrome. It’s juggling way too many genres and tropes at once and because of that, it’s failing to carve itself a distinctive identity. What we get is a muddled mess.One overarching theme seems to be exploiting the female characters. This is an anime for lolicons a la Kodomo no Jikan. It’s pretty shameless in how over-sexualized the characters are. The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t. You’ll be a lot happier that way. went into it thinking such, which is why I was so scared after the first episode.

The worst offenses come with the DVD extras that includes a whole portion where Illya is dressed up like a cat and being forced into poses that are…not appropriate for a girl her age. And the magic wand (these things talk by the way) tells us that she’s responding to the desires of the audience.Oh come on! The writer, director, and animators want to blame the viewers for this? We all know it’s a joint venture!  The studio’s getting off just as much.And the DVD extras are bad. Except for Rin in a maid outfit. But otherwise, they’re all useless and more excuses for nudity and sexuality. There’s one where they play strip-Life. The board game. Turned into a stripping game. Eh?And also, there’s a pervasive sense of lesbianism between Illya and Miyu, just to help that image of underaged fap-bait.I’m bitching a lot about this show, but I did find some decent aspects to it. It’s watchable and less painful than a lot of shows I’ve seen, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s got so many faults. There are a couple awesome fights within, good animation, and great music. It’s begging for fans of the Fate series to watch it but it’s begging for a lot more besides. It’s…to put it bluntly, fap-bait. If you’re into loli, here you go. If you’re not, well, I wouldn’t even touch this series with a stick.  Even if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise, just don’t. You’ll be a lot happier that way.', 'STORYOn the outside, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya just seems to be a magical girl parody of the Fate series, and in many ways it is. Though, it manages to stand on its own with a story I can take seriously. The story starts off as a monster of the week show, but like any good magical girl show, it deviates from the formula. With focus on the internal conflict with Illya and external conflict with a new character Miyu. Though, I found the two conflicts to be cliche and predictable (Rehash of MGLN). The whole conflicts between rival magical girls and personal...motivation, has been done else where and done better. Although, thanks to the direction of Shin Oonuma, the drama and conflicts were actually enjoyable. With Oonuma directing many drama series before, he knows how to make the viewer care for what\'s actually happening on screen. I felt emotion for what was happening, whenever the show was being heartwarming, chilling, etc. And I have to give credit for that. Also, the throw backs to Fate lore was very much enjoyed and appreciated. Overall, while nothing new, the story was highly enjoyable.CHARACTERS *This section contains spoilers*The cast consists of mostly alternative versions of their Fate/ counterparts, with there only being two new characters. The magical stick sapphire, and its master Miyu. With Miyu being the only new character worth talking about. Miyu is that typical cold isolated girl you see in a lot of magical girl shows. And, she also goes through the typical development that comes with the cliche. Not saying that\'s a bad thing, it\'s just predictable. She grows from a cold person to our main character, then to a nice one. It\'s that simple. Speaking of our main character, we have Illya. Illya is a character from the original series, and is the only one that has a dramatic personality change. In Fate/Stay Night, she\'s a cold killer, but is somewhat mischievous to the people she trusts. In this show however, she\'s a normal girl. Illya a normal magical girl protagonist, but what also comes with this is the typical development. Like Miyu, Illya also goes through a typical magical girl character\'s development. She\'s been given a duty she knows nothing of, then she begins to doubt her position in that duty, but in the end she grows to be stronger to protect what she loves. Although, unlike Miyu, Illya\'s development was refreshing. Illya\'s internal conflict takes up a lot more time than the average magical girl protagonist. The show made an effort to give her internal conflict real meaning. Illya actually gets inner monologues on her how she really feels about the duty she has been given. And, while I\'ve seen better magical girl protagonists, seeing things done this way was refreshing.*End of spoilers*As for the rest of the cast, none of them really get any development, but are just throw backs at the Type-Moon universe. They\'re most there for comedy relief, and they do their job. While the comedy isn\'t Carnival Phantasm funny, it got a few laughs out of me. All in all, with there only being 2 stand out characters, and both only having slightly above average development, the overall characters are passable.ANIMATIONAnimated by Silver Link, the animation is pretty good. With decent use of lighting, the tone the art gives off is a fun lighthearted feeling, with dark undertones. The character designs of the original characters, stay faithful, but they have a bit more cartoon style than their original\'s. I also like Miyu\'s out of costume design, for some reason. Though, I notice the character designs aren\'t always consistent. There\'s a few times a character would go off model, although that can be forgiven. As for the actually animation, the  regular scenes are standard fare. Though, the action scenes are particularly impressive. The movements are fluid, and combined with the really good directing, makes the action look even more impressive than Fate/Zero\'s. (Fate/Zero had crappy fight direction, in the first season at least.) Overall, while there were some small dips, the animation is well above average.SOUNDComposed by Tatsuya Katou, the music isn\'t standard magical girl music. The style is more of a mix between F/SN\'s and magical girl OSTs. This results in some calm slice of life music, and epic battle music. While the slice of life ones aren\'t anything special, the epic battle ones, are pretty good. I particularly like the Illya version of the EMIYA theme. It\'s probably my favorite version of it. (Maybe) As, for the OP and ED, I liked them, but I admit they weren\'t that special. Catchy and that\'s it.As for the dub.... It was a a big meh. It\'s one of sentai\'s better dubs, but it\'s not that hard to be one of the ""better"" sentai dubs. While the acting is okay, the a few of the voices don\'t match the characters. Illya sounds too old in my opinion and Rin doesn\'t really have that charm to her voice. I kind of wish they went to bang zoom for this dub, but I understand that they wouldn\'t make as much of a profit on this show, compared to the F/SN UBW movie.OVERALLI\'ve always liked Type-moon, particularly the Fate/ series. With Fate/Zero being my favorite anime. So, when Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya got announced, I was a bit ""ehh"" about it. I mean, Fate and magical girls? One part of me was expecting for it to be bad, and another was being optimistic. So, when it actually turned out to not half bad, I was honestly pleased. I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future motivation, has been done else where and done better.

I seriously enjoyed Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya, and I\'m looking forward to where ever this sub-series will go in the future', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When people think of magic in relation to the fantastical, people think of wizards, spells, and all-powerful incantations. It\'s something that doesn\'t exist in the real world, as much as we would like it to be. ""Magical girls"" take it one step forward. On top of the magic, they also include transformations, cute girls, and life lessons. In Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya (what a name!), these common tropes are found once more.STORYF/k (I need to shorten the name at this point!) starts by having our main character, Illya, one day encountering Ruby, a magical stick that gives Illya the...power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original. That is, F/k is a spin-off of the ever popular Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero setting. F/k can essentially be viewed as this alternate timeline in which F/SN and F/Z\'s characters never participated in the Holy Grail War. Already this alienates people from the series. If you don\'t know the characters, the original world, or the lore behind everything, it makes the show harder to watch. This isn\'t to say that someone should refrain from watching F/k if they have yet to see the other two, but you are not getting the full experience otherwise.F/k mainly explores two separate themes: facing your fears and ""the power of friendship."" Talking about the first one, both Illya and Miyu face these issues but for different reasons. Illya is a girl who is thrust into these scenarios despite not fully investing herself into what is happening. She\'s more outgoing and emotion-driven. Contrarily, Miyu joins the fights not because she wants to but because she has to. She\'s reserved and quiet. F/k did a nice job of creating this dichotomy between the two to represent where they were coming from and what makes them face these incredibly dangerous situations.The second part, ""the power of friendship,"" is quite common in anime. It\'s prevalent here as well. While the story itself contains many battles, its real focus is on the development of the relationship that Illya and Miyu have. Again, this goes back to their backgrounds and motivations, and through these they learn to accept one another for the different people that they are. This idea isn\'t the most perfectly executed version of this trope, but for the most part, the show does an okay job of having the girls go through the ups and downs of a budding relationship.ANIMATIONFate/Zero is highly lauded due in part to its animation and art quality. F/k, surprisingly, is of no exception. While watching the show, I could have sworn that ufotable (the team behind F/Z) had also worked on F/k.Beginning with the art style, the show does a great job of varying up the locations. They stick to the more famous ones, and as someone who knows about the world, it was nice seeing the same landmarks again. The lighting in the show is also very well done. The nighttime scenes and general lighting on the characters always seemed rather high in quality.F/k\'s greatest feature is definitely its animation. It is rather spectacular at times. One of the things that surprised me while watching was the heavy amount of detail that went into the fight scenes. They were very, very good right up until the end. The sparkling shots, the dense mana shields, and the amount of movement and choreography included in the show was quite pleasing to watch. I did not expect such detail when watching a ""Fate-universe spin-off,"" so what I got to see was rather amazing.The character designs are ""original"" yet true to those of the characters from the Fate universe. Everyone\'s most striking characteristic were their eyes. They have these nice mix of colors and ""punch"" to them that makes them stand out. This is especially true for Illya and Miyu. When they are looking at you on-screen, you can\'t help but fixate your eyes on their\'s.CHARACTERSF/k has roughly four main characters that are looked at: Illya, Miyu, Rin, and Luvia.I\'ll start with the weakest. Rin and Luvia are introduced quite early and display their personality and rather violent relationship with one another from the get-go. Afterwards, they become more like guides than actual characters. You don\'t learn much about them other than what purpose their mission serves. I would have liked to have seen more background on them, and more specifically Luvia, but since they weren\'t the main focus, I was left with what I got.Illya is the star of the show. She\'s optimistic, cute, funny, and caring. She dreams of being a magical girl and this wish gets granted. However, she learns that there is more to it than just having fun and using magic. It\'s something that helps to test her ability to move forward despite the hardships that she encounters. She takes for granted the abilities she earns but eventually understands and accepts that her position is special, that it is not something that should be taken lightly.This revelation is thanks to Miyu. Miyu is stalwart, smart, and athletic. She\'s very determined and focused on her objectives. So much so that her behavior often causes others to misjudge her as being standoffish when she is actually quite lonely. It\'s this loneliness that has compelled her to always try and do things her own way. But much like she did for Illya, Illya allows Miyu to see that being together is going to be much more powerful than being alone any day of the week.The characterization here for both of the magical girls is somewhat plain. It\'s nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, it is probably quite cliche. But as I mentioned previously, the show does a good job of creating this dynamic between the two that allows them to go from simple partners to extremely close friends.Beyond Illya and Miyu, the rest of the cast is rather weak. We get to see some cameos from big names, but they don\'t do much other than provide comedic relief or proper advice.SOUNDThe OP, like the girls, is quite magical in the way it sounds. Unfortunately, it isn\'t that good. It\'s too generic in its rhythm to be anything worth really listening to. The ED is rather upbeat and mirrors the happy nature that is Illya\'s and Miyu\'s relationship. However, again thanks to a rather generic beat, it\'s not that good. In fact, after listening to the two, it sounds as if both use the same percussion piece.The soundtrack is harder to talk about. It contains pieces that are both quite fitting for the situations at hand and somewhat absurd/silly in the way they sound. Meaning, it\'s a mixed bag of both good and bad.Voice acting is average in the show. However, they do use the same actors/actresses from the Fate anime universes in here as well. This was a nice touch, and I thank the creators behind F/k for doing this.As a final note, one of my favorite sounds in the show was Miyu\'s ""flying."" I found her technique not only cool but with the added sound effect it made it pretty awesome.ENJOYMENTMagical girl shows almost always end up the same way. The girls become magical, they have fun, they experience hardship, then they unite to conquer evil. F/k pretty much follows this same pattern. It\'s never really funny or dramatic, so I never found myself laughing or being invested in the characters.Above all, what F/k does best is its battles. They are quite a feast for the eyes with their multitude of colors, the actual movements involved, and the interesting abilities used throughout. But when the show is not having the girls battle, it\'s rather boring. The story itself isn\'t captivating and the characters are not good enough to make me care for them. Plus, I found Ruby and Sapphire to be kind of annoying during the show.Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya is a common magical girl show that has great battles hidden beneath its surface. I think that without the Fate universe backing F/k, it would not be as well-known as it is today. This may be an obvious statement, but if that is its main draw, that is an unfortunate and sad fact.SUMMARYStory: Fine, magical girls with the ""Fate"" world as its settingAnimation: Great, great art with stunning animationCharacters: Fine, Illya and Miyu fit their magical girl rolesSound: Bad, nothing notable except for returning VAs and sound effectsEnjoyment: Fine, good battles but not much elseFinal Score: 5/10 power to transform into a mighty magical girl.Right off the bat, it\'s important to understand that the world behind F/k is not original.

With this entry in the Fate series, I went in expecting something big. The bar set by the previous series was huge and I'm not surprised that this fell short (in fact, why even compare the two?) . However, what's here is a solid MG anime with a dash of Fate thrown in.The story is told is a very straight forward fashion. Through the perspective of Illyasviel von Eizenbern, the viewer gets a blend of mediocre middle school drama, heart-pounding battles...and a colorful main cast. The plot as a whole is solid, yet a tad predictable and the comedy, especially in the beginning, hits all the right notes. Despite the good foundation and nice twists in the combat, the series suffers from a glaring plot hole three-fourths through the series, when Illya suddenly gets a burst of extreme strength. It's origins do not seemed to be explained especially well in the series. An implied fact perhaps for longtime fans? I'm not sure. Also, I don't entirely understand where the class cards came from, which is another blow to the plot.The art of the series is a nice fit, with a clean presentation and colorful special effects. Every magic attack looks both powerful and visually appealing and melee combat has weight behind it. The character designs of Illya, Miyu, Luvia and Rin each fit as well.The sound of the series doesn't stick out particularly, but the voice acting is good. The opening is sufficient and the first ending is good. The second ending is better, but not by a lot.The characters of this series are mixed in terms of quality. Illaya is, from what I've seen, a 'self-aware MG', as early in the series she questions the very foundation of MG girls. It was entertaining to see her ponder these different elements and these quips kept me smiling and more importantly, interested. Miyu seems like a typical silent girl, but she complements Illya's bubbly personality  well. The pair of Rin and Luvia are good as well, but Luvia doesn't get very much character development. The magical rod twins Sapphire and Ruby are more comic relief than anything, since their attempts to move the plot are usually clouded in with their own humor which gets old very quickly. All the other characters, however, fall by the way side. I don't remember any of the classmates and the other residents of the house seem quite one dimensional.Episodes seemed to be dragged out, which made this 10-ep series seem much longer. However, the quality was consistent and the series had great action scenes. The fan-service was a bit awkward, since the the two main girls are 12(?) year olds,  but luckily it wasn't too frequent. This is anime comfort food. Those who hate MGs need not apply, but if you like Fate or just want an anime that doesn't require you to think too hard, this is a series to watch.Overall, this is a good anime. The plot suffers from holes but keeps you interesed, the sound doesn't do anything special but gets the job done and most of the characters are shallow but the ones that matter are good. The art is truly exceptional. This series showed that even MGs can be pretty cool when you slap the Fate label on them. and a colorful main cast.

I must say that I watched this because some Fate/ fans friends told me that 3Rei was good and was worth watching the previous seasons first (I’m still to check that for myself).[ Story | 6 ]The story, for me,...is boring. Plain and simple. I don’t find joy in watching some “magical girls” over moe-fied to funny stuff while fighting the evils of the world. Leaving that aside, the plot is WELL CONSTRUCTED. Why do I say with this? The mechanics are based of facts already used in the main Fate/ franchise, like the origin of the Kaleido sticks, servants, dimensions od, mana, prana, and some other things. Those resources were used to create this universe and this story that while I find boring and not in my taste at all, I won’t deny the author did a good research and documented well before writing, and that’s always a good thing. You know, to keep consistency even if we are talking about an Alternate Universe (AU).[ Art | 7 ]The Animation is good. It has some flaws in some frames that do not move smoothly but overall is a good animation. I do not like the art-style tho, at all.The use of FX is great, you know there’s a lot of lights and explosions going around.[ Music | 7 ]The best part of it, the music. Good OST, the music used for fights was really good. And inclusion of classic tracks like EMIYA make the music get a better rating, even when they are from FSN originally. I don’t say the same for the OP and ED that I didn’t like at all. (Would give it a 6)[ Character | 3 ]Yeah… this is weird… I like Illya, Rin and who else but in the real Fate/ franchise. This “Illya” tho… I don’t consider her Illya, but a character that looks like her in this AU. She doesn't have the qualities that made me like Illya in the first place, in fact, I highly dislike this Illya and almost all the characters. Same goes with Rin, just a shell of what she really is, I only see a over acted tsundere shell.[ Enjoyment | 4-5 ]Too much stuff that I didn't like, while the animations are pretty is not enough for me to enjoy an anime. I can understand and accept that people may like anime like this but, this doesn’t seem to be something of my taste. Random power ups, sometimes ignoring principles already stated, lack of real character development.. fanservice on little girls…[ Overall | 4 ]For me, my rating is 4 (Bad) to 3 (Very bad). While I said that the plot has bases and the author documented to write its story, I still didn’t enjoy those 10 episodes. There were episodes better than others but for the most part I watched each episode with cringe or a serious expression.

Very cool are the various 'light' and 'spark' effects during the action sequences, with the characters swinging around & clashing their melee weapons and casting their magical spells. The protagonists' various metamorphoses are not...that bad either.◧ Comedic sequences: probably my favorite part of this series are the comedic scenes, usually revolving the protagonistic duo of elementary students, Ilya & Miyu, having fun with their fellow students/friends and their hilarious teacher, Mrs. Fujimura.◧ Action scenes: generally, decently choreographed sequences, though at times felt somewhat shounen-ish. They are escalating quickly and ending abruptly while alternating between different levels of the third-person perspective coupled with some good slow-motion work. Unfortunately, Silver Link is not able to deliver the incredibly polished, live-action like results that Ufotable was able to deliver in UBW (check my review → t.ly/qU71).✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Concept: formulaic, somewhat Sailor Moon-ish - one day, an ordinary elementary student is chosen by a magical item to perform some incredibly difficult, possibly life-threatening, magic-related tasks.◧ Character development: simply, there is none to speak of. Besides some sporadic insights (mostly, during the last 2 episodes) into our protagonistic duo's intentions, emotions, and thought processes, without any attention into their personal histories, the audience does not get to understand anyone else. We have no idea who Rin Tohsaka & Luviagelita Edelfelt are and the history of their relationship. We have no idea why Ilya gets to have servants, while her parents are conspicuously absent from her life (her mother appears in one episode).◧ Plot: if one were to start with this spin-off series, without having watched beforehand anything else from this universe (e.g. F/Z, F/S, UBW), he/she would not have a clue about anything. We have no idea about the extent of the magicians' powers in this fictional world. We have no idea what this mysterious organization named 'Clock Tower' is all about. We have no idea what these magical sticks actually are and why they abandoned their original owners at the drop of a hat.

Oh well, it’s not like anyone will read my review anyway.Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya is a spinoff series of the popular “Fate” visual novel series. This show adopts a satirical take on the popular “Magical Girl” genre of shows with the well known Fate characters thrown into the mix. It aired in the Summer of 2013, adapted from the manga series of the same way.My first experience with this particular series was a popular clip of two young girls clad in typical magical girl outfits making out, complete with close-ups of spit-swapping as another girl watches...along clearly in a daze. Such a titillating scene, contrasted with such young age of the protagonists had me raising my eyebrows for a while. Subsequently, I caught whiffs of controversy surrounding this series, some claiming it to be “lolicon” pandering, specifically trying to attract individuals using subjects who are underaged and may or may not be portrayed in a provocative manner. This controversy surely cannot be left untouched, said, knowingly two years late to this anime, and off into this show I went. I must disclose that I am not a lolicon as previously stated.What greeted me first was the overly-experienced, overly large and detailed eyes of the main characters. Illya’s eyes were bright pink, common to anime, and drew my attention right away. Yes, one might be quick to point out that eyes have and have been always drawn in ridiculous proportions. Yet, I must emphasize that eyes drawn in such a manner, pupils more than whites, deeply engrossing, was a rather enjoyable aspect of Fate/Kaleid’s visual design, indeed reflective of the saying that one’s eyes are the windows to the soul. Still, it is such a pity that such well designed eyes act as the windows to such a poor and uninspired character, our main protagonist, Illya. But we shall get to the characters later.To begin with, the story and setting takes place in normal. modern setting (I assume Japanese), and spirals into a cliche magical girl plot. Experienced watchers know, a girl makes a wish for the unexpected, for the excitement in her life, and suddenly a magical stick shows up and forces the girl to become her master without her consent, very much with Illya in disagreement. Here, I must the show pulls a twist that has become rather mainstream to the post-Madoka era of magical girl genre, which has become rather moot by now, I feel. But, for this small twist to an overused trope, I shall give some merit to the show. Then, the girl, imbued with whatever great magical powers goes off to collect cards, fight and make friends along the way. Cue the boss fights, magic visual effects, the power of friendship and so on. Typically, I would have little qualm about these tropes writers adopt for their stories, but for Fate/Kaleid, the distinct lack of polish or refinement to the settings, tropes it borrowed, makes it mediocre, run-of-the mill, filler with Fate glued on. Another show I would like to compare it to would be Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, which implements very much identical tropes of friendship, struggles, but does so more elegantly, more enjoyably. Thus, the story and setting could use a bit more creativity or refining.On the visual side of things, Fate/Kaleid liner Prisma Illya does have plenty to offer. Studio Link may not be the most popular or well known anime producers, yet, they have experienced staff who are very much capable of providing punchy visuals when it wishes to. Characters are designed with strong presence, very much maintaining the  attention of the viewer on whoever is in the scene. One stand out was a particular fight scene I would not name, for fear of spoilers, but this one fight had em sold on the capability of Studio Link. The movement was fluid, every action had substantial impact and gave a very solid feel to the whole sequence. It was as though Link tried to imitate Ufotable’s style, Ufotable being the studio being closely associated with the Fate series. In anycase, it was rather well-done, and future shows could benefit from such effort put into its action scenes here, this sequence exceeding far beyond my expectations. Throw in some light visual humor, regarding Rin parading about in a Magical Girl outfit she’s too old for, and the show comes out with above average for its visual style, with the aforementioned fight scene and the design of the character’s eyes being a standout for me.The characters, they are another issue for me. I feel they really drag the show down. GOing into the first season the show provides characters with paper thin motivations and generally made the narrative less compelling, to the detriment of the show, to say the least. Each character has the personality of their canonical counterparts with a few quirks thrown in, Luvia’s arrogance to Rin’s inferiority complex, yet lacking anything else. This leaves the show feel hollow. Any form of driving force is hid behind the mysterious “Mage's Association”, a mysterious cabal seemingly directing most of the actions taken in the series. I could go on, but I want to focus on Illya now. She flip-flops around, very truly lacks motives behind her actions apart from the superficial ones that she casually states at a convenient timings, and suffers from doing things “just because”. She could have been more well written to reflect emotional depth, anything to show temperance within the shallow pool of her personality. Apart from that, an airheaded demeanour really does not sell her character for me. Such a shame, she had such pretty eyes.It might strange to hear this, but this is actually my first experience with the Fate series, spin-off be it may, and yet I still found the portrayals of servants, masters, mages engaging, and found myself recognising the well known characters of the canonical series. Some may scream heresy at my statements, but I feel that for a spin-off, this series still pays homage to the original series, where even an outsider can recognise the parodied portrayals of its characters. That is to be respected, for a series to remain faithful to its source.In all, this show merely rehashes the same tropes and points from the “Magical Girl” genre, while using Fate characters to carry out the same plot we have seen too many times. Perhaps it is the lack of runtime in its 10 episode length, or it could be a cash-in to milk fans for their money, we will never know, but what we were presented with was far and away the best that such a combination could offer. Turn to this show if you have spare time, or wish to see get more Fate, albeit in a parodied sense. Magical girl fans will not be too satisfied with this show. I know I wasn’t.Lastly, the “lolicon” accusations. Overall, I found this show to be rather light on the fanservice. Sure there was some provocative scenes, but it was not to the point of being highly contentious or objectionable. These scenes helped to interject some life into the series and made it somewhat engagin even as side gags.Overall: Not Lolicon/10 along clearly in a daze.

After the girl is chosen, they are given the task of capturing the seven epic hero class cards that reside throughout the city in a mirror dimension. After capturing these cards the girls will be able to use their power as equips to transform their wand into a weapon similar to weapon the epic hero was carrying. For example if they use the lancer card the wand will turn into a lance and it will have the same abilities that lance has.After watching a few episodes, one might feel that this is just an attempt to milk the popular fate series for a quick buck but the story does get better and more serious as it goes on and becomes more like the fate series we know and love. It also has some epic battles in there that you might want to see more than once. I can understand if someone only watches a few episodes and drop it then say bad things about it but if you continue to watch, you will be rewarded. After seeing the complete series myself all i can say is that I recommend any fate series fan to watch it and I'm looking forward to season 2. Please bare in mind that this season does not end like fate/zero did with a cliff hanger ending at the first season but instead it ends after they have defeated the last boss.SoundThe sound was great and I enjoyed the new version of the famous Emiya theme from the fate series. Though I wish i heard it more during the series and at the final battle as well.CharactersThe characters personalities were the same for Tohsaka Rin and Illya's mother in this series but it is different for Illya. The Illya in this series is a very nice little girl like you would normally see in other magical girl anime but the saddist side of her is in their somewhere deep inside. The magical wands especially the one illya uses is very annoying but you will get used to it if you keep on watching.Enjoyment and conclusionAt first i did not enjoy this series because of the idea that this is just a cash grab and the annoying wand that illya uses but as i continued to watch the series, it began to turn into a typical fate series with epic and serious battles. I really enjoyed this series and I recommend all fate fans to give it a chance because the normal fate series is finished and a spin off is all they can do to keep fate alive.

It has stonks of humor but also everything needed to make you feel close to the main characters and possibly tear...up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem. That comes in later seasons.If I was to just judge this based on how good the anime is, putting aside all lore, it's brilliant. It's a touching story (no pun intended, again, next seasons) of fates intertwining. You can watch it with no worries, there's only some controversy in literally the first episode which is more slapstick comedy that actually makes sense than anything else. up at the ending.The art style, as generally in this series is just beautiful, the artist did everything to make the girls as adorable as possible.To make this point here: if you're not a fan of fanservice, no problem.

Ended up liking the entire Fate series as well. Heh, worth it.There are reasons why I want to watch this so bad. The reasons include :- Yuri- Magical Girl- CutenessBelieve it or not. This show has all of them! I’m not kidding. All of them. The yuri scenes are hot fire just like the ones I saw on XVIDEOS and Pornhub. There clearly is a magical girl. And everything is just moe moe. I couldn’t ask for more, lmao....This is what you call a masterpiece for degenerates. Absolutely top-tier.[SPOILER REVIEW] ( An Additional )[NOTE] : The spoiler-free review is above. Why bother reading this part if you haven’t even finished these followings -  Fate/Zero, Fate Stay/Night : Unlimited Blade Works, Fate Stay/Night, Fate Stay/Night : Heaven’s Feel ( Until II ).If you didn’t finish the ones listed above then I advise you to scram. Otherwise prepare for a barrage of spoilers.So you know how the Fate series treated Illya as if she’s destined to be harrassed. Yeah right. We all know how sad it was when she got destroyed. Twice!Well if you felt sad for illya then Prisma illya would be your depression curer. Since Prisma illya is pretty much her series. We get to spend time with her 24/7 and see her kiss and grope other lolis. Oh yeah. Thank you, Fate series. This shit is what I needed after seeing her dying multiples of times.A bit irrelevant but I haven’t jacked off for weeks. Thanks to this, my long lost routine has returned.

Arigatou Gozaimasu~ ( sorry if I spelt that wrong I’m sleepy )', ""Quick Review.Story:Decent story derived from Fate/ series. Collection of cards by magical girls.Not deep by any means but works for the series and the fact that they keep it at 10 episodes actually helps. The pace was quick which worked for it.Art:Grade A++. Phenomenal artwork, animation work. Gorgeous lighting.Small things such as the refracted lighting, glow of the outlines, beautiful backdrops; just really, really skilled execution in the art section. Principles of animation used often and successfully gives personality to the characters (squash stretch, pose-to-pose, etc). Effects are corful and fun.The quality of art made this series fun to watch....Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs. Mood music set the mood right.Love the piano work. It's subtle but fits in well with the slower sections of each episode.Character:Decent character development. Not fully developed as there are more seasons to come. But, good start. Typical magical girl anime character development. Drama ensues. Lots of crying. Lots of good feels too. Also some etchy but not too much.Enjoyment:Fun to watch. Fate/ references and cameos welcomed.Animation and effects top notch.Overall:9. Fun to watch.Don't expect a deep series. But expect to enjoy it since it is short and fun.Also if you watched the Fate/ series, you'll enjoy the twist on each character. Sound:Good music. Loved the opening and EDs.

While it's partially true, there is much more to this anime that makes it stand on its own.Being a mostly comedic spin-off, Kaleid doesn't go to deep with a story. Synopsis is pretty much all that happens in this anime plot-wise.But being simple doesn't mean being bad. Prisma☆Illya manages to keep perfect balance between comedy and serious moments. You won't experience out of place comedy nor forced drama. Both comedy and drama are of high quality: jokes are funny and feel good. Drama doesn't annoy viewer, is easy to understand and...feels natural.Action scenes are also really good. They give you the right feeling of urgency and uncertainty with their speed, angles, music and flashiness.While story has serious moments, some blood and fight for life, I'd still say it's generally light anime. Don't expect tragic developments from other Fate titles.Another small detail worth mentioning is magical girl genre deconstruction. No, not Madoka-style one. Just some small remarks that add to comedy but also point at some self-awareness of characters and story.The strongest part of Fate/kaleid are characters. First thing you will notice is that they are surprisingly (for anime) intelligent and not naive. Their actions are mostly logical and emotions are natural. Outside of some comedic moments, they behave normally, without making you irritated with some weird fails just for plot progression.Another thing about characters is that they are deeper than having just one defining trait. You can see other sides of their personalities. They develop.Thing that really plays nicely with characters is art. Their design, animations, voice acting and especially facial emotions are all great and give them yet another dimension.I think I could recommend this anime to majority of anime fans. It's nowhere as niche as I expected.I came here for loli fanservice and stayed for... other loli stuff. While fanservice part wasn't as good as I hoped (I heard it gets there in later seasons), I absolutely fell in love with characters and don't regret watching Fate/kaleid. feels natural.Action scenes are also really good.

Sure, it looks very childish and the theme ""Mahou Shoujo"" does not seem very fitting for a franchise like Fate, but I feel as though we judge too quickly to understand how unexpectedly violent and horrific things can become by becoming a magical girl.Story - 7/10The story itself was nothing grand, there were no plot twists, no huge backstories and no skipped topics, the story was played out like how a story should be done. The concept reminded me of another anime which involved collecting cards too.Art - 10/10The art is something I would really like to point out because one of the factors that got me interested in the Fate series in general was the visuals that were presented. They were absolutely stunning and extremely colorful when it came to the action scenes, which is something I enjoy looking at. The animation was also very well put into this, which had really grabbed my attention after watching a couple episodes. I haven\'t enjoyed such great action scenes in a long time. They were fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining because it wasn\'t a repeated animation of them trading blows and swings which makes animation look cheap, but you could see the outline of where they swung and hit, which was amazing.Sound - 7/10The sound was perfectly fine, nothing spectacular stood out and nothing sounded out of place. The voice actors and actresses were well chosen for the personality and look for each character. The opening became a catchy tune to me overtime, and the ending was nice to listen to, no complaints.Character - 8/10When creating a show, you definitely need characters that can entertain the viewer in some way, these characters do just that. The protagonist goes through the struggle of fighting these disasters, but also witnessing how life threatening the task that she was given can be. Her emotions which are usually cheerful and bright during her daily life change her into someone who is afraid and terrified of what her job is to do once she realizes the reality of her dreams.Personal Enjoyment - 9/10This was an amazing experience for me to watch, considering how I have never watched a realistic take on the ""mahou shoujo"" genre. It was fun to watch, but the first minutes and episodes did make me fall asleep a little. Other than that, this anime is definitely a thrill and very entertaining.Overall - 8.2/10Since this anime is where I started in the Fate franchise, I am extremely excited to see what the other adaptations are like. Overall, this anime is absolutely worth watching and I hope that people will stop bashing this anime just because it involves characters from the original adaptation and how this anime does not suit the original series. It is perfectly fine on it\'s own and I can\'t wait to see more of this show. help.Also, I would like to claim that this is my very first review so I do not expect to be the best at this type of thing, I only chose to review this based on its score coming from the audience, it really surprised me when I first saw it.Without further ado...This anime is definitely the kind of anime that people will judge just by looking at what is seen in its title picture.

It\'s always about the quality, the execution of elegance, the prowess of what they\'re doing, and the legacy. In a one-word layman\'s term, it\'s the awesomeness.Compared to my previous reviews where I was talking about Lexus, Hyundai and BMW as metaphors and analogies for the anime that has nothing to do with cars, in Fate/Kalied Liner Prisma Illya (or Prisma Illya for short), I\'ve got a definite reason of talking about Mercedes Benz--it\'s because Irisviel\'s sports coupe that Kiritsugu bought for her is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL!And the 300SL is the pioneering-gullwing Merc...that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG. Fate/Zero is just pure and ravishingly wicked and it\'s Urobuchi outdoing himself the same way that Mercedes-AMG has outdone themselves with creating the SLS-AMG. It\'s how Fate/Zero is the sacred predecessor of Fate/Stay Night in the same way as the SMS-AMG is the spiritual successor of the 300SL.As the SLS-AMG is the Holy Grail of the Mercedes-AMG, the Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is, however, the Mercedes AMG-GT. Yes, it\'s Merc and yes it\'s AMG, and it\'s fast, but it\'s like a Mercedes-AMG but isn\'t. Prisma Illya is pretty much taken as that. You expect the FATE trademark and quality, and somehow you get a spin-off of a main-antagonist-turned-protagonist-turned-magical-girl. Yet, like the AMG GT, it\'s Mercedes-Benz and AMG under the bonnet and quality after all, in the very same way that Prisma-Illya still is part of the FATE series.The story centers on Mai Kadowaki\'s ever-renowned character, Illyasviel Von Einzbern, the Teuton violet-clad Japanese-German loli-hybrid bent on winning the Holy Grail war in F/SN, gets a spin-off of becoming the MC magical girl collecting cards called ""Class Cards"" referenced from F/SN\'s seven Heroic Spirits or servants.CHARACTER: 7Let me put it this way. It\'s quite difficult to assess characters with spin-off roles, because they have a different role than the original, but still retains the same appearance, same personality, and even the same seiyuu. It\'s a make-or-break, really, to see if the spin-off version can handle or fill up the shoes that the original version initially has established.In the original Visual Novel (yes, I\'ve finished the VN\'s three arcs: original, UBW, and Heaven\'s Feel; and watched F/SN animation, the Fate/Zero s1 and 2, Prisma Illya\'s season 2, and even Carnival Phantasm), even Illya has gone from the initial smirking antagonist to someone who\'s clingy and moe. Then there\'s Rin Tohsaka, who, even in the original Fate/Stay Night, serves as the walking-dictionary-slash-instruction-manual for the MC and yes, we saw her reprise that role.There are also two new characters for the Fate/Kaleid Liner installment: Miyu, who\'s a kuudere and the yuri partner of Illya; and Luvia-sama, who\'s very good trait that I like about her is she\'s voiced by Shizuka Itou.ART: 10This is art from Type-Moon we\'re talking about. Saying some nonsense about the way the artwork is made is like saying Mercedes-Benz cars are unattractive. Art concern alone, FATE has nailed that since 2004.SOUND: 6The opening/ending songs are great and Illya-sounding, really. However, we\'re missing something: we\'re missing Yuki Kajiura here. And that\'s very much exactly like missing the SLS-AMG\'s 6,208cc 6.2liter M159 V8 engine, when you\'d know that the AMG-GT now only has the 3,982cc 4.0liter M178 twin-turbo V8.Yet, there\'s a promise, seiyuu-wise, where seiyuus retained their original and renowned roles from the original Fate: Mai Kadowaki voicing Illya, Kana Ueda voicing Rin, even Ayako Kawasumi has her cameo as Saber; then new roles for the chosen awesome seiyuus: Kaori Nazuka for Miyu, and Shizuka Itou for Luvia-sama.But then again, there are no Yuki Kajiura compositions here.ENJOYMENT: 7Despite all its spin-off elements and a story where it has exactly nothing to do with the Holy Grail war, because that\'s what the Fate-series is all about, Prisma-Illya is still enjoyable and worth watching if you treat it as a magical-girl anime. Like I said earlier in Mercedes-Benz analogy, the AMG-GT is a Merc, but somehow it isn\'t. If you treat that as an SLS-AMG, then you\'d rather be better off buying the Porsche 911. Or the Jaguar F-Type. Everybody loves Jag.OVERALL: 7I have no qualms about this, even if it causes real FATE-oriented fans/otakus to bat their eyebrows, and gives moe pigs a reason to smile like Chesire Cat (especially if they\'ve or you\'ve watched the specials).All in all, it\'s to be expected when you\'ve seen it yourself that Illya has become a magical girl, because as sentient as a human being you are, you\'d immediately get the logic. You won\'t be scratching your head in comprehending it like how German Engineers solving and understanding calculations for their Merc\'s performance, you\'d just automatically get it--as completely as understanding where this is going.Still, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is a fun thing to watch even if it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War. It makes a nice tally of all your magical-girl watch-list.Verdict: Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is just like how you\'d expect the Mercedes AMG-GT to be: it\'s Mercedes and it\'s AMG alright, but don\'t treat it as the SLS-AMG. that is as legendary as the Excalibur. It\'s like Saber with gullwing doors and headlights: agile, powerful, and considered as one of the most outstanding timeless cars with excellent ratings in all categories.STORY: 7In FATE series, you could say that if Fate/Stay Night is the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, then Fate/Zero has got to be the Mercedes-Benz SLS-AMG.
